Not only are the current vice-captains of the men's and women's teams from Odisha, but the state has over the years produced several national-level hockey players and stepped up to develop infrastructure and sponsor national teams. When in 2018, the state government decided to sponsor the Indian national hockey teams (men/women, junior/senior) for a tenure of five years, replacing Sahara, it was the first time that a state government had decided to sponsor a national team. The government had pledged Rs 150 crore for the purpose. \"The state government would like to continue to partner and provide the best facilities to the teams. The main objective is to bring back the glory of Indian hockey. Indians have an emotional connection with hockey, which is believed to be the national game of the country. Therefore, Odisha will extend all possible support in the coming years,\" Secretary, Sports and Youth Department, Government of Odisha, Vineel Krishnan said. The state has hosted major tournaments in the last five years. It hosted the World Cup in 2018, the 2014 Champions Trophy, and Hockey World League final in 2017. It is also the host for the 2023 Men's Hockey World Cup, to be played in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. \"Not just in India, but even on the world forum, for a state to step up and support a sport, the contribution of Odisha is immense. The fact that national teams have camped in Bhubaneswar ahead of major tournaments is a manifestation of how we have progressed in terms of infrastructure and logistical support,\" former Indian hockey captain and chairman of Hockey Promotion Council Dilip Tirkey said. With the World cup in mind, the state cabinet in March this year approved the 'State-level Sports Infrastructure Development Project' for development of infrastructure at Kalinga Stadium, Bhubaneswar, and construction of International Hockey Stadium in Rourkela, at an estimated cost of Rs 356.38 crore. The Rourkela stadium will be the largest in India, with 20,000 seating capacity. In 2018, collaborating with Tata group, the state government established a Hockey High Performance Centre at Kalinga Stadium. It also has 12 grassroot centres, at which over 2,500 young trainees are being trained. Of the 20 sports hostels in the state, two in Sundargarh are dedicated to hockey. The state government is now working to set up 17 astro turfs in all 17 blocks of the district. \"Indians used to dominate hockey till the arrival of synthetic turfs. It is important for our kids to start playing on synthetic turfs. Therefore, we are investing Rs 200 crore for 20 hockey training centres. The state will provide professional coaching based on sports science from a young age,\" Krishnan said. The state has over the years produced greats like Dilip Tirkey, Ignace Tirkey, Lazarus Barla and Sunita Lakra. The current Indian team has Birendra Lakra, vice-captain of men's team, and Deep Grace Ekka, vice-captain of women's team. The common link between them all is their home district of Sundargarh. In Sundargarh, a mineral district in northern Odisha, hockey is more than just a sport. With the recent performances at the Olympics, the district has erupted in joy. \"We get queries about hockey even from remote villages. Due to the pandemic, we could not conduct the talent search, but enquiries have not ceased. We are confident that with the infrastructure development and overall boost to the sport, we will produce more and more national players from here,\" said Sundargarh District Sports Coordinator and senior hockey coach Milton Bilung. \"Deep was 11 when she started training under me. Over a decade a lot has changed. With the current boost to the sport, many children are more interested in hockey,\" Tejkumar Xess, senior coach of the state hockey team and Deep's uncle, said. Veteran players are also rooting for talent from other districts. \"Of late, players have emerged from Deogarh and Sambalpur as well, but we wish to focus on districts like Koraput, Kandhamal, Malkangiri as well, and set up nursery training centres,\" Tirkey said. \"As a coach, the only gap we feel is the lack of coaches for all districts of the state. We are just four coaches. If every district has a coach, healthy competition within districts will help develop our young players better,\" Xess said.  \n Topic 3: \n \t What does it feel like to be India's first ever track & field medallist? I am absolutely delighted to have won the first-ever track and field medal for India, that too a gold. It's the beginning of a new revolution in Indian sports. I don't have words to explain how it feels. It was a proud moment for me when the tricolour was fluttering and the national anthem was being played at the stadium. I was standing with the gold medal around my neck. I believe the coming years will be great for Indian athletics. The time lost in 2019 because of my injury (he had developed spurs in his elbow — in his throwing arm) and then because of the coronavirus in 2020, I believe the gold medal has healed all those bad memories and it has brought immense satisfaction to me. Every athlete dreams of winning an Olympic medal in his lifetime, but here I am with a gold, what more can I ask for? I am an optimist and a firm believer in destiny. So, I believe if this gold has come despite the challenges posed by my injury and Covid-19 during the last two years, then I think the time lost was also in a way good for me. During the final, what was going through your mind after each throw? When did you start feeling that you could actually win gold? When the final was underway, there was only one thought in my mind that I had to give my best with every throw attempted. I have to ensure that my body movement remains in sync with my throws. I was confident about my game. Javelin throw is a very technical game. It's more about using your brain and keeping calm. A slight deviation from the technique can ruin your attempt. Does not matter that I couldn't break the national record or achieve my personal best mark. The Olympic gold has its own shine and value. I realised that I had won the gold when the other competitors couldn't produce their best in their last attempts. How Klaus Bartonietz's technique was different from Uwe Hohn? I have been training with coach Klaus since 2019 and he has contributed immensely to my gold medal success in Tokyo. His planning and technique suit my game. I was with another German coach Uwe Hohn in 2018, I worked on my strength and fitness with him. We had a slightly different approach. He had his own ideas and wanted me to continue with that. I had a different technique of throwing. So, I spoke to him about this and then moved on to train under coach Klaus for finetuning my technique. The way Klaus guided me and worked on my overall game benefitted me the most. Every coach has a different style, so I would like to say Thank You to Hohn sir as well. But it was Klaus under whom my overall game improved, my technique improved and you all can see the results. You dedicated your medal to Milkha Singh ji. What was your thought behind that? I have watched Milkha Singhji's several videos from his athletics career. He wanted the Indian track and field athletes to conquer the Olympic podium. He lost narrowly a medal in Rome 1960. So he always wanted someone from India to go and win at the Olympics. When I won the gold and the national anthem played out, all his words came flooding my mind and I just couldn't control my emotions. Sadly, he is not with us to see this day. But, standing on the podium, I just thought about him, his long-standing wish and decided to dedicate this medal to him. PT Usha mam also dreamt of an Olympic medal during her career, so I have also fulfilled her wish. Standing on the top of the podium, listening to the Jana Gana Mana and seeing the national flag being hoisted, what was that feeling like? What was going through your mind? The feeling was that all your hard work and sacrifices have paid off. There are no words to describe those feelings, it can only be felt, And I know how it feels. What is the next goal now for Neeraj Chopra- the athlete? I will celebrate my win back home, eat Choorma dish prepared by my mother. I'll take some much-deserved break and sleep well. Then, I'll start my training and focus on the next year's Commonwealth, Asian Games and World Championships. You have been getting a lot of attention on social media. How do you see all of this? Yes, I can see I have gained so many followers on social media after the Olympic gold. Good that people now know me, they see a star in me. But, I focus on my game and social media in my free time. It's just for enjoyment. What did Klaus say before the final? Klaus told me, throw your best in your first attempt like in the qualification. Don't leave anything to chance. I had also spoken to my uncle Bhim Chopra and my childhood coach Jaiveer before the final, they also said the same thing. They knew that something good would happen on Saturday and that's what happened. People are saying that you should play yourself in your biopic! What do you think about that? Right now, my full focus is on my game. The biopic can wait. When I retire, a biopic can be made on me. I want to earn more achievements, bring more laurels for the country. I want to earn more respect as an athlete, so that there can be new stories associated with me when I finally hang up my boots.  \n Topic 4: \n \t In a final day swoop at Tokyo 2020, the United States earned the bragging rights of Tokyo 2020 by moving ahead of China on the medal table. The three golds that they clinched on Sunday just put their noses in front at the finish line, 39-38. The one in women's basketball may have been on expected lines, but the women's volleyball team winning their first-ever gold drew them level, and Jennifer Valente's cycling gold proved to be the clincher. The one-medal gap between the top two is the closest ever. Before Tokyo, it was at Athens 2004 that the USA with 36 gold and China with 32 gold were involved in a tight race. The other interesting aspect of the tally was the emergence of first-time medal winners. In what is the largest list of medal-winning countries at any Games, 93 different nations earned a podium finish. The number of gold-winning nations at an edition - 63 - also broke the record of 59 set at Rio 2016. Just like in Rio, where Jordan, Kosovo and Fiji medalled for the first time, the Tokyo Games ended with three new countries joining the medal table - San Marino, Turkmenistan and Burkina Faso. The newest on the list of gold-winning nations are Qatar, Bermuda and the Philippines. The final tally seemed unlikely with just a few days left when China had a significant lead in the gold medal count. Over the last several editions, the top position on the gold medal table has been the preserve of the USA or China. In fact, the last Games where a third nation topped the standings was Barcelona 1992, with the 'Unified Team' of the erstwhile Soviet Union states securing the most gold medals. Fluctuating fortunes The US's gold medal count of 39 this time is down from the 46 golds they won at Rio 2016 and London 2012 each. China, which dominated on home turf in Beijing 2008 with 48 gold, won 26 gold in Rio 2016, just one behind Great Britain who finished second. In Tokyo though, the Chinese have equalled the gold medal haul they achieved in London 2012. The American haul this term dropped in their traditional strongholds like swimming (16 in Rio, 11 in Tokyo), athletics (13 in 2016 and seven now) and gymnastics (four and two). The retirement of Michael Phelps and the withdrawal of Simone Biles affected the tally. But the Americans still managed to gain new strides in other events - wrestling, shooting, golf, fencing, and the new 33 basketball and surfing events. China meanwhile improved their already impressive performance in weightlifting (seven gold medals this time compared to five in Rio) while matching the seven they won in diving from five years ago. Shooting was a successful event, as they clinched four gold, compared to the solitary gold Zhang Mengxue won in the 10m air pistol event in Rio. They also tripled their gold medal in swimming to three, but couldn't defend their women's volleyball title. New horizons The Americans won gold in Tokyo in several events not always considered their strengths. Lee Keifer won an individual foil gold in fencing, Nevin Harrison won in canoeing while Anastasija Zolotic triumphed in taekwondo's featherweight class. For China, gymnastics was a big success with four gold medals (including trampoline), while in Rio they failed to win a single gold medal. They also secured top spots on the podium in sports like canoeing, fencing, rowing, sailing and cycling. India's new high With their best-ever tally (one gold, two silver, four bronze), India finished 48th on the table - their highest position since the 1980 Moscow Olympics which was boycotted by 66 countries because of the Soviet-Afghan War. India finished 23rd in Russia, having won just the men's hockey gold. In fact, the 48th position in Tokyo is India's best finish at any Olympics where they won more than two medals (they were ranked 26th with a gold and bronze at Helsinki 1952). Golden sunrise in Japan Japan finished third - their best - in the overall medal table for the third time (after Rome 1960 and Tokyo 1964). The 58 medals they won - 27 gold, 14 silver and 17 bronze - in 2021 make this their most successful edition. A stellar performance in judo helped the hosts in the overall ranking. In London, Japan won one gold medal in the sport and three in Rio. Over the 15 events in Judo this past fortnight, they won nine gold, two silver and a bronze. The Japanese also dominated the new skateboarding event, winning three of the four gold medals on offer. They also maximised the return of baseball and softball to the Games' line-up, taking both gold medals. Different name, similar haul Since the end of the Cold War, this was the sixth Olympic Games where 'Russia' competed as a country. But they could not use their name, flag or anthem based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) sanctions due to the country's infamous doping scandal in 2014. Instead, the contingent went by the name Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). This was also the second smallest contingent from the country, 333 compared to the 282 that travelled to Rio. In terms of the total number of medals won in Tokyo, the 71 (20 gold, 28 silver and 23 bronze) put ROC third on the leaderboard. But they were fifth based on gold medals - the official standard - behind the USA, China, Japan and Great Britain. This was a better performance from the ROC compared to the 19 golds each in London and Rio. The gold medal in the women's team gymnastics event - their first ever as Russia - made the difference. The Olympic 'Ashes' A rivalry that transcends sports, Great Britain again pipped the Australians in the gold medal tally, 22 to 17 to finish fourth and sixth respectively in the overall tally, though the latter had a much better showing this time - they won just eight golds in Rio. The Australians, courtesy Ariarne Titmus' double gold over USA's Katie Ledecky, won nine golds in swimming compared to the three from Rio. Meanwhile, the Brits continued dominating the cycling event like only the Brits can, winning six gold, four silver and two bronze medals just as they did five years ago.  \n Topic 5: \n \t  In Simone Biles's decision to quit, lies a crucial lesson for young women everywhere. It comprises a single, two-letter word: No. Biles's decision to pull out of the Olympics does more than shine a welcome spotlight on mental health. By prioritising her own well-being over every tribal call for team and nation, she has reclaimed the power of saying \"no\". In a month when the Norwegian women's handball team has been fined for refusing to play in bikini bottoms and choosing shorts, like male players, the word stands out like a flashing beacon particularly in cultures and societies like ours where good girls don't say no; where they are brought up to never complain, never ask for anything for themselves; where they put family first and eat last and the least. From their birth, girls are indoctrinated into submitting to the unquestionable authority of patriarchs: Fathers, brothers, husbands, and fathers-in-law. Please \"adjust\" is what they are told when they are pulled out of school, made to do housework unlike their privileged brothers, or, find themselves in abusive marriages. Even the slightest deviation cannot be tolerated. And, so, this past week, in Savreji Kharg, Uttar Pradesh, 17-year-old Neha Paswan was beaten to death and then strung from a bridge, allegedly, by her grandfather and uncles, for saying no to changing out of the pair of jeans that she had chosen to wear for a religious ritual. Earlier in July, a 19-year-old woman in Alirajpur, Madhya Pradesh, was beaten up and hung from a tree for refusing to return to a violent marriage. The main accused are her father and two cousins. In Dhahod, Gujarat, in June, two girls, 13 and 16, were thrashed by a group of 15 men in an incident that was videotaped. Their crime? Talking on a mobile phone. These incidents are part of the every day normal for young girls who cannot be allowed to cross male-ordained Lakshman rekhas. This is a world where mobile phones are out of reach for women of a certain impressionable age, lest they do the unthinkable: Strike friendships with boys, break caste and gotra endogamy, fall in love, perhaps, run away and elope. This view of the hapless young woman, incapable of making her own decisions, who must be protected by her father and brothers, her husband and father-in-law, her village elders, and even the laws of the land and the courts is pervasive. It's what leads to a 23-year-old woman's father convincing a judge of the Kerala High Court that his daughter could not have possibly converted and become Hadiya of her own free will. It's what has led to the enactment of so-called \"love jihad\" laws in four Bharatiya Janata Party-run states despite the National Investigation Agency telling the Supreme Court that there is zero evidence of a \"conspiracy\" to lure and entrap innocent Hindu girls into marriage, and conversion, by Muslim men. In this normal world, a 19-year-old adult Hindu woman and a Muslim man arrive at the Ballia district magistrate's office to marry under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. The marriage is thwarted on the basis of a complaint by the woman's father. For good measure, members of the Karni Sena group are on standby to physically prevent the marriage. Like old Hindi movies, the police turn up in the last scene, find no evidence of love jihad, but arrest the man anyway, on charges of kidnapping. The woman is handed over to her father and, a day later, issues a statement saying she was being tricked by the man. What kind of law subverts the agency of women who are guaranteed the status of equal citizens by the Constitution of India? Worse, perhaps, is the silence of Opposition parties and, even, the higher judiciary. It is a silence borne of the certainty of majoritarian public support in favour of \"controlling\" daughters. It's a silence validated by the data that tells us that even in urban India, 93% of all marriages that take place continue to be arranged marriages. But Simone Biles also tells us that saying no carries a price. For putting herself above her team, there has been applause for sure, most critically from her own team, but there has been no shortage of critics, including the odious Piers Morgan and a troll lynch mob that hides bravely behind anonymous handles. Women should not have to pay such a high price for asserting themselves. But they do. It is absurd that a woman who speaks up about workplace sexual harassment should be dragged to court by a boss whose entitled predatory behaviour was an \"open secret\" for over two decades. It is shameful that a woman in a rape trial should have not just her identity revealed in the court judgment, but also details of her private life. Women who protest in public are shamed in public, as students at Banaras Hindu University were when they marched against a molestation incident on campus and were ticked off by their vice-chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi that they had \"sold a woman's modesty and brought dishonour to the university\". Launched to protest against discriminatory curfew hours in college hostels, Pinjra Tod founders Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita were arrested in May 2020 under anti-terrorism laws and released 13 months later on court orders. Simone Biles might have just made it that much easier for young women everywhere. Her decision tells girls that they matter, their voices are important, and that it's okay to put themselves first. It reclaims the first word that every girl must learn because it is raw and powerful and has the capacity to bring about change. Namita Bhandare writes on gender The views expressed are personal  \n Topic 6: \n \t  Actor Salman Khan called her 'Nation's superstar and 'Asli Dabang'. And she very much is as the now Olympics silver-medallist Saikhom Mirabai Chanu opened India's medal count at Tokyo Olympics in a resounding victory, clinching a silver medal in 49 kg category in women's weightlifting event. Her silver is only the second Indian weightlifting medal since Karnam Malleswari's at Sydney 2000. \"Sab sapna jaisa hai.Bahut bada moment hain mere liye (This feels like a dream),\" shares Chanu who always dreamed ahead and has showed the world that dreams do come true. \"Jab main game shuru kiya mera sapna tha. Pehle toh samajh nahin aata tha ki kya karna hain..games mein kaise karna hai. But game mein jaake kuch bada achievement lena hai. Isliye main dheere dheer mehnat kiya. Maine sapna rakha tha ki Olympic mein jaake kaisa hoga. Olympic medal lene se kya hoga. Jab se main games shuru kiya tha tabse sapna tha. Bahut mehnat kiya maine.\" Chanu, who is from Manipur, is thrilled that more and more girls will be inspired to take up weightlifting now. \" Bolte hain 'Ladki kuch nahin kar sakti'. Woh bhi karke dikhana tha pura India ko ki ladki kar sakti hai (I wanted to show everyone that girls have the strength and they can do it),\" says Chanu, adding, \"Humne karke dikhaya hai. Sabhi ladkiyo ko bhi pata chalega ki ladki kar sakti hai. Ladke se koi kami nahin hai. Koi bhi ladki sports mein jaana chahti hain toh family ki bahut support zaroori hain bahut zyada. Ladki sirf padai hi nahin sports mein bahut kuch kar sakti hai. Jo uske pasand hai. Main chahti hoon ladkiyan weighlifting mein aake, weightlifting aur India ke naam ko upar le jaaye,\" she says. The athlete is overwhelmed with a congratulatory call from PM Narendra Modi, to messages on social media from actors such as Anil Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu, and Anushka Sharma, who even applauded her for her Olympic ring-shaped earring, which her mother gifted by selling off her own jewellery. \"Rio ke baad maine man mein aaya tha ki Olympic ka ring main rakha chahti thi (After Rio's failure, I wanted to keep the ring of Olympics close to me),\" she says, adding, \"Maine mummy ko bola mujhe aisa chahiye. Woh bole chain ke liye, par chain toh mujhe nahin chahiye thi kyunki Olympic medal chahiye tha. Isliye maine earring mein banwake rakha tha.\" Chanu is loving all the adulation coming her way, and her increase in social media followers count as well. \"Main social media itna follow nahin karti thi, sirf training mein focus karti thi. Phone itna use nahin karti thi. Abhi dekha toh itna friends ho gaya hain mera,\" she smiles, adding, \" Main khud ko proud feel karti hai. Sabhi ne pehchana hain ki weighlifting kya hai. Aur main kaha se aayi hoon. Sachi bolon toh kisi ko pata nahin chalte thi ki Manipur kaha rehte hai. Manipur chota sa state hai, use hum nikal ke kar sakte hai,\" she says. Her family hadn't eaten on Saturday till her game had finished, and later celebrated with fish, but she plans to have Eromba, a popular Manipuri delicacy when she goes back home. \"Yeh spicy dish main kaafi saalo se nahin khayi hoon. Aur ab khana chahti hoon mummy ke haath hai. Unhone mere liye itna sacrifice kiya tha. Aaj un logo ki wajah se pura duniya pehchani mujhe,\" she says. Her Rio failure had left her disheartened and so much so that she had vowed to win an Olympic medal one day. She credits her coach Vijay Sharma who she says keeps her motivated. \"Sabhi players ki alag alag cheez hoti hain. Kuch down bhi chale jaate hai kharab hone se. Mera andar aisa hain ki aaj agar acha nahin hua toh main kal kar sakti hoon. Isliye main taiyari mein rehti hoon. Mere Vijay sir ne bahut motivation diya hain ki kuch fail hote hain toh woh mujhe samjhate hain ki aaj hi khatam nahin hua hain, aage door tak jaa sakte hai. Isliye jo aaya hain use face karna chahiye. Mind ko strong karna chahiye,\" she shares. Ask her if she ever wants a biopic on her, and she laughs and says: \"Haan. Jo bhi mere liye movie banayigi woh mere liye bahut bada baat hain. Koi bhi bane toh acha hain. Dekhte hain kya hoga.\" Author Tweets @Nainaarora8 Follow more on Facebook and Twitter  \n Topic 7: \n \t PV Sindhu makes history by clearing browser caches of her competitive life. Her secret to succeeding on a badminton court is remembering, unfailingly, to forget. Win or lose; rinse, don't remember, don't repeat. There was the BWF (Badminton World Federation) World Championships gold medal she won in 2019, by forgetting the two stinging losses for silvers of 2017 and 2018. This time at Tokyo, Sindhu carefully erased all thoughts of gold or silver to nail a bronze, making this her back-to-back medalling in the Olympic Games. The disappointment of going down in the semifinals was scrubbed clean after the initial tears. It is how Sindhu is staggeringly successful, in obliterating landscapes of losses that would leave most others wandering and lost. Badminton revels in its disappointments. It nurses regrets and carefully curates every despondency. Malaysian legend Lee Chong Wei never won the Olympics or World Championships titles. Indonesian Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat just couldn't crack the All England Open championships. Taipei's Tai Tzu-Ying, who is the closest a muggle can come to Wingardium Leviosa, controlling a feather with a wizard's wand, risked being told she was altogether inadequate had she not made it to the badminton podium this time. Sindhu, too, was told she can't winthe finals, the perennial doubts tarnishing all her silvers. Sindhu herself barely ever publicly indulged in these long, meandering post-mortems. Ask her about her second match at Tokyo where she faced Hong Kong's Cheung Ngan Yi, who had dragged her into an 87-minute wringer at the 2017 Glasgow World Championships, where she was on all fours, panting heavy, and could barely stand up. Memories like that - an almighty plod even before Japan's Nozomi Okuhara tested her in the famous final - can leave bruises that can jump up at a nervy stage like the Olympics. Not for Sindhu, who has a sketchy recall of that match. \"But every time we get onto the court, it's a fresh match and I don't think about what has happened before. We, of course, make strategies from the earlier games, but every time you come on the court, you don't think about past matches. You just come with a mindset where you need to give your best present,\" she says, after winning her bronze. \"Best present\" is Sindhu's own invention - an original tense that means living only in that moment, which is an unburdened, untangled, isolated few minutes before a rally. She didn't know whether to be sad about the lost gold or be happy about the second chance. Her Korean coach Park Tae-Sang wasn't quite spouting Nietzsche that evening after she lost the semifinals, by telling her \"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders\". He did pithily tell her though that the fourth place would leave her wretched. Ice bath, recovery massage, dinner, sleep...and memory of the semifinal brushed aside. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind; the prayer of a bronze accepted, the wish for gold, resign'd. Sindhu is the reigning world champion; she has won a bigger medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016. The bronze is only the third step on the podium. But Sindhu saw the next 24 hours with algorithmic ease: one medal, two countries gunning for it, and a Chinese southpaw with suspect backhand, \"Hulk, Smash\". Sindhu has enjoyed an upbringing of a First World athlete. That is not to say her family didn't face financial struggles or that she didn't go through the uncomplaining repetitions during practice to keep her body fit. But marked as a special talent, not shy of working hard, she didn't struggle for facilities. She had it all - top-notch academy, high-performance coaches, shuttles, international tournaments, and seamless funding from the establishment. Sindhu's athletic, rangy game was meant to succeed if she could keep herself uninjured and agile. It needed fine chiselling like the Bidri metal craft and not a dramatic DIY store makeover. Getting on the Forbes list of highest-paid women athletes in 2019, showered by sponsors, Sindhu never had to claw at the basics or build a pucca house, like some others who won at Tokyo. She earned her privilege and preserved it, and stayed within the comfortable straight and narrow on tricky issues, non-committal on anything that could nudge her away from the pleasant and polite. India remained an indulgent country, but Sindhu was only one dip away from facing the proverbial cold shoulder. Yet, this was badminton, and she lost plenty on either side of her five medals at the World Championships and two at the Olympics, of which one was gold. In the absence of any major turbulence that ails Indian athletes, her struggles in her snugly cloistered universe were of the elite First World variety: How to forget a stinging loss and move on to the next medal. Around this New Year's at the UK, after a happy snowy Christmas enjoying her freedom from minute-to-minute monitoring, Sindhu would post an emoji-bookended message: \"Life's not about expecting, hoping and wishing, it's about doing, being and becoming.\" It was the first of these motivational \"for self\" Post-its that you realised she buys into: ignore expectations, remember actions. Athletes lead fishbowl lives, but in the absence of square-meal struggles or rancour, they tend to keep their life hacks simple. When the Olympics draws came out, it was evident that players strewn across her path from the quarters onwards could trip her up. The preparations had been to her satisfaction and she would get down to shedding old, damaged statistics by declaring every opponent as tough. Not everything went as planned. But she shrugged off both the snub to her wish of being a flagbearer and the snapping at her heels by Japan's Akane Yamaguchi in the quarters with the same nonchalance. Resentments, reputations, reversals, railroading by opponents leave her completely unperturbed. If it's all the same, she'd rather sit back with some bubble tea and look to the next match. Landing in Tokyo, Sindhu enjoyed being in her terrain. \"Olympics is everybody's dream come true. The Athletes Village itself is a nice place. There are lots of athletes who do really well and get those medals,\" she says. Though all she remembers is settling in nicely at her sophomore Games. Ask her about routines of medal-chasing athletes, and she forgets she's one among them, talking in third person. \"Those top shuttlers get into a routine. I noticed how they do things and how every athlete has a different exercise workout,\" she recalls. There's a kaleidoscope of movements as she revs up the engine for the knockouts. Like the forced perspective filmmakers have in movies such as The Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland or King Kong, where objects look larger by playing with space and distance, for Sindhu, opponents appear in sharp focus. Yamaguchi fetches up, life-sized in the quarters. Cue: Forget just how endlessly the Japanese can retrieve. \"There were long rallies. There are no easy or short matches against her. So, I have to be patient and put the shuttle in the court and use my attack, even though she retrieves,\" she says. Getting bogged down by the prospect of a tough grind isn't Sindhu's style. But nothing went right in the semifinals against Tai. A dream of a gold ended, just like that. The Taiwanese dictated points, unveiled trickery and packed the Indian off. The lost semifinal meant Sindhu could miss out on a medal at the Major League for the first time in five years. She cried, then stopped, and erased the thought for first and second place. And then, it began, the slashing at the prospect of a dreaded fourth finish. Looking back, while Tai has dominated completely, Sindhu latched on to a safety that helped her cope. Ask her if she mulled over lost points and she waves it away with a long \"Noooo\". \"I played my best. Sometimes, it happens that it might just not be your day. So, yeah, if I might have won the first set, it would have been different. Perhaps, the net-cord was the difference,\" she muses. This happened at the 18-18 stage in the first set. A net-cord is considered poor luck when the shuttle nicks the net and can fall on either side. Thin margins are bonafide blemishes, and a scaffolding comes up around her confidence, where she will not, for the moment, admit and analyse how strong Tai was. Scratch the match, move on. Day of the bronze match, breakfast is bread, egg, bacon sausage and some milk. The match is scheduled for the late evening. Lunch is katsu curry and rice, and other Japanese food. \"More than that, since our match was in the evening it was like 'When will I play...when will I play...and, when will I get onto the court?' That was the only thing going on in my mind,\" she says. Fade the expectations, focus on actions. When she was younger, Sindhu would bite her nails before a nervy match. Then nail-art happened. Polish and glitter didn't taste good. Her opponent that day, China's He Bingjiao, was a compact player and technically proficient, but Sindhu would have none of it. She figured the bronze was the most coveted thing, that moment, for the two nations. \"Everybody was aiming for that medal to make their country proud. He Bingjiao has really good wrists so her deception also was very good. But, again, it was important that I am in every point, even if she was covering leads. I made sure even though I'm leading, I don't give her easy points. I maintained that and got the medal,\" she says simply. The bronze morphed into a sympathetic pat on Tai's back as the Taiwanese waited for the award ceremony, dealing with her loss of a gold. \"I congratulated (China's) Chen Yufei. Of course, Tai was feeling bad so I just told her everything will be fine,\" she recalls. \"Silver's a good medal,\" the bronze winner told Tai. It was the warmest of exchanges, where Sindhu forgot her own disappointment and got into the shoes of the silver medallist. At Rio, she had realised she was the only one on the court to lead Spain's Carolina Marin through her early moments with the gold. She might have become India's biggest female Olympian, but Sindhu has a healthy relationship with a loss. And the bronze. At the 2013 World Championships, when she won her first, she knew the enormity of it. \"I was super, super happy. I wasn't very experienced then. So, getting something new was exciting,\" she recalls. A year later, again at the World Championships, the medal shape-shifted into the \"first time for a second successive bronze.\" She makes her peace with bronze, then she forgets about it. In December this year is the World Championships at Huelva, Spain, Marin's hometown, where she'll defend her title. \"It's the first time I'll be defending my title; it'll be exciting,\" she says. Spotless sunshine. Eternal Mind. Same Sindhu.  \n Topic 8: \n \t  India's Air Pistol and Air Rifle shooters are gearing up to compete in the Mixed Team events come Tuesday, July 27, 2021, when both the 10M Air Pistol Mixed Team and 10M Air Rifle Mixed Team competitions make their Olympic debuts.

With the rise of zealous coaches, crowdfunding platforms, state government schemes for rural athletes and keen parents, some of India's mainstream and non-mainstream sports are sprouting from new epicentres. This is perhaps why talent scouts can now find worldclass badminton players in Nagpur, champion sprinters in Tiruchirapalli and promising gymnasts in Tripura. TOI plots a few of the emerging hubs on the country's sports map 2.0 With world-class pugilists Shiva Thapa, Jamuna Boro, Lovlina Borgohain, Bhagyabati Kachari and athlete Hima Das, Guwahati has emerged as a boxing and athletics hub over the last decade. Borgohain, who has become the first woman from Assam to qualify for the Olympics and the second boxer from the state to represent the country following Shiva Thapa, was 13 when she was spotted by Indian boxing coach Padum Boro in 2013 during a SAI boxing trial. Three track-andfield athletes from Trichy — Arokia Rajiv, S Dhanalakshmi and V Subha — headed to Tokyo, following commendable performances in national-level events like as Federation Cup and Indian Grand Prix editions. Manikandan Arumugam, Dhanalakshmi's long-time coach, credits the sturdy sporting ecosystem in Trichy. “Schools, both government and private, conduct regular athletic meets where talent gets spotted. The presence of a Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu centre in Trichy offers the required facilities such as free food and topnotch training to amplify their potential,” said Manikandan. With two established racing platforms -- the popular Bangalore Bicycle Championships and Bangalore Amateur Racing (BAR) — providing plenty of racing opportunities, seasoned pros and aspiring riders from various states have made Bengaluru their home. There are at least two races a month for the riders to look forward to. “Community racing is the stuff that builds the culture of racing and no other place in India has that going for them,” said six-time national champion Naveen John. A popular UK-based firm is looking to unearth more talents who could one day race on the bigger tours across the world. Trained and skilled by the Tata Archery Academy, Jamshedpur has emerged as the archery hub of Jharkhand. The world cup winning women's recurve team comprising Deepika Kumari, Komalika Bari and Ankita Bhakat come from this academy. Indian women's archery coach Purnima Mahato also hails from the academy. Odisha's capital city Bhubaneswar, famous as the 'city of temples', is slowly morphing into a 'city of athletes'. International events like the Hockey Champions Trophy and the Asian Athletics, held at the main Kalinga Stadium, came as a boon. The hockey turf too was upgraded. The turning point came when Odisha was awarded the hosting rights for the Hockey World Cup in 2018. The hockey stadium in Bhubaneshwar was again renovated and a second pitch set up. The city will now host the next Hockey World Cup along with Rourkela in 2023. Not too far away, the other mini powerhouse of sports in India, Manipur, has so far produced 17 Olympians, seven of whom are hockey players including Sanglakpam Nilakanta Sharma, a member of the current Indian hockey squad in Tokyo. Khong Kangei — an indigenous sport akin to hockey but played with bamboo root as ball and bamboo stick — has helped local players adapt hockey techniques. Astro turfs coming up and dedicated local coaches contributed to the game's ecosystem. Between the 1960s and 80s, 24 gymnasts from Tripura went on to win 60 national championship medals. But after a long lull that followed in the '90s, it took Dipa Karmakar's bronze medal in the Commonwealth Games in 2014 to bring Tripura into national focus. Tripura's affair with gymnastics began in the 1960s when gymnast Dalip Singh revamped the Vivekananda Byamagar. Mangaluru, the coastal town of Karnataka, is lined with beaches. When local authorities realised its tourism potential, it led to a windfall in another sphere — water sports. While surfing, kayaking and sailing became the main draws, it was South African cricket ace Jonty Rhodes who made water sports in Mangaluru famous when he visited Mulki, 30km from Mangaluru, for water sports in 2013 and has been a regular visitor. Rhodes has been a draw for the young, who began taking interest water sports. The city also hosted an Indian Open of surfing competition and many water sports clubs mushroomed over the past few years. Today, a large number of local fishermen's children have taken up sports like surfing competitively. Once the preserve of Bengaluru and Hyderabad, badminton began to bloom in Nagpur, more famous for its oranges. The city came up on the sports map when Arundhati Pantawane became junior India number one and won the 2011 National Games gold. She later became India number one and world number 40 at a time when the 'City of Oranges' lacked badminton infrastructure. Later, city shuttlers Rasika Raje and Vaibhav Bisne put Nagpur on the national platform and coaches like Kiran Makode and Ajay Dayal nurtured young talent like Malvika Bansod, Ritika Thaker, Vaishnavi Bhale, Rohan Gurbani, Mugdha Agrey, Mrunmayi Saoji and Rashi Lambe.

Hailing from the hotbed of weightlifting in Manipur, Mirabai's tryst with the sport came at the 1990 Beijing Asian Games participant Anita's training centre in the Khuman Lampak stadium, at Luwangsangbam in North Manipur, some 22kms away from Mirabai's remote village of Nongpok Kakching. The youngest of six siblings, Mirabai's father Saikhom Kriti Singh is a construction worker with the state's Public Works Department, and mother Saikhom Tombi Devi runs a small tea stall in the village. Anita recalled how Mirabai lived on home-made steamed black and white rice, and boiled vegetables during the four years of intensive training at her academy. “Mirabai's silver in Tokyo has fulfilled my dream of setting up an academy that can produce Olympic medallists. But what makes her journey sweeter is her determination to make it big irrespective of the hardships she had faced while growing up in a middle class family,” Anita recalled during an interaction. “The first time I saw her, she was probably 9 years old, and she would comfortably lift around 70kilos, which was double her body weight. And believe me, she would live on home cooked boiled vegetables and black rice. Today her perseverance has paid off,” Anita added. “The best part of Mirabai's childhood is she never complained no matter how rigorous the training schedule was, she would undergo it without a word,” she further said. On being asked the secret of the state producing so many weightlifters, Chanu said the average Manipuri has the right build for weightlifting, “short but with good muscle mass”, especially for the lower weight categories. The youngster went on to become a junior national champion in Chhattisgarh in 2009 before breaking into the national camp in 2011, when she came under Anita's former teammate and 2006 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Nameirakpam Kunjarani Devi. “I first met her during the youth national camp in 2011. I used to take feedback about her from coaches back in Manipur, there was a spark, determination and willpower in the youngster. She has always been a coach's delight, and would religiously stick to the rules set by the coach,” recalls Kunjarani, popularly known as the Hercules from Manipur. “During that time, she had good body muscle mass, and appeared to be a great prospect. I worked with her till around 2015-16, even during the South Asian Games in Guwahati,” she added. “Even after 2016, when I left the national camp for another assignment, I used to keep track of Mirabai's progress, as she carried a billion hopes to Tokyo, her medal testifies our belief in her, she has made us proud,” the two-time Asian Games bronze medallist further said. In the last five years, Mirabai has won the Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 followed by a fourth-place finish with a national record of 201kg in the 49kg category at the 2019 World Championships in Thailand. Earlier this year, she took a bronze with a combined total of 205kg at the Asian Championships in Tashkent. Now that she has accomplished her mission in Tokyo, the Chanu household in Nongpok Kakching eagerly awaits her return to prepare her favourite dishes, especially eromba, a mildly-spiced stew of fish and vegetables and celebrate her rise as India's latest poster girl of weightlifting.  \n Topic 11: \n \t Silk Stalkings When we learnt that my father had been named as the new ambassador to Romania, my first thought was not 'Land of Dracula' but 'Land of Nadia Comaneci'. After all, the tiny powerhouse had wowed the Montreal Olympics just two years prior by scoring the first (of seven) perfect 10s on her way to three gold medals in gymnastics, aged just 14. I could turn a few (laboured) cartwheels myself and felt ridiculously excited about the 'connection'. We never did get to meet Nadia in our three years there—during which she won more golds attheMoscowOlympics—but itwasclearthat a whole nation hung on her every move. It was like she was their only light in a gloomy world of isolation and socialist deprivation as she was one of the few Romanians allowed to travel the world back in the day. The only other Romanian sportsperson with a similar following was the mercurial tennis player Ilie Nastase. But before her Moscow encore, Nadia inexplicably went AWOL. Even though there was no social mediato amplifyindividual voices, it was clear that a whole nation was on tenterhooks about her. Reports emerged much later—which she initially denied—that she had tried to kill herself by swallowing bleach in 1977. But there was undeniable evidence that she was troubled, as she had gained a huge amount of weight, purportedly binging on chocolates. At that time, the Communist regime's sports bosses found her and returned Nadia to her former coach—who had been pushed aside in favour of state-sponsored ones—and got her back in shape for the Moscow Olympics in 1980. She had to put her evident depression aside and focus on bringing glory to her country. And she ended up striking gold again there for two routines—beam and floor—and also bagged two silvers. All this when she was still a teen. Mental health was not mentioned in sports circles back then, and kids barely into double digits regularly competed in high pressure events, where injuries were a constant possibility. In fact the Communist countries of eastern Europe seemed to have an endless supply of tiny (practically) tots doing near-impossible manoeuvres in gymnastics with almost robotic precision, ending their routines with cute grins that belied their heaving, bony diaphragms. Their biggest advantage—if it can be called one—back then was their relative isolation as the gymnasts spent their waking hours training in special schools and hardly ever ventured into the outside world. While it made them into performing ponies in a way, it also insulated them from the glare of public interest and, worse still, expectation. Their training schedules were inhuman, and the kids had to often put up with actual cruelty and abuse from their coaches. But there was no question of the children pulling out. And certainly not during the actual event, as happened this week with the veteran US gymnast Simone Biles, who at 24 is no stranger to the pressures of top competitions. What stands out in Biles' action is not merely her encoring the issue after the 23-year-old US tennis prodigy Naomi Osaka pulled out of the French Open in May but the fact that these two girls reached the end of their tether so publicly. Public opinion is often neither informed nor fair, patient or understanding. And thanks to social media, cutting comments which sportspeople would never hear are now there for all to see, “like”, and add their own “expert” opinion. Social media quite clearly does not believe in the adage, “It's not about winning or losing but about how you play the game.” So the dark side of top level sport today is not about the cruelty of coaches but that of the relentless public. Mental strength needed to win in a sport now has to be boosted to take on public opinion and sponsors' demands too. Neither Biles' nor Osaka's family, coaches and doctors seemed to realisethey werestrungout andstrugglingtilltheir public meltdowns. Were their retinues so focused on victory—and retaining public adulation—that they did not see the fragile human beings behind the two sports prodigies? That does not sound very sporting at all. Nadia defected to the US in 1989 and is now married to a fellow gymnast Bart Connor. She first met him at that landmark Montreal Olympics but she has no recollection of it; imagine the tumult in that 14 year old's mind. The pressure to win is a thousand times more now, with billions of us focused on stars at the Tokyo Olympics. From our armchairs, we—especially on social media—must be more mindful of the humans behind the phenomena.  \n Topic 12: \n \t Vandana Katariya becomes the first Indian women to score a hattrick in Olympics Striker Vandana Katariya scored a historic hat-trick to keep alive the Indian women's hockey team's quarterfinals hopes in the Olympics with a fighting 4-3 victory over lower-ranked South Africa in its must-win final group match here on Saturday. Vandana (4th, 17th, 49th minutes) achieved a rare feat by becoming the first Indian woman hockey player to score a hat-trick in the history of the Olympics. Young Neha Goyal (32nd) was the other goal getter as the Rani Rampal-led side registered its second consecutive win at the Games. South Africa's goals came from the sticks of Tarryn Glasby (15th), skipper Erin Hunter (30th) and Marizen Marais (39th). With two wins from their final two pool matches, India have finished the group stages with six points from five games. By virtue of this win, India have jumped to the fourth position in Pool A, but Ireland still have a chance to leapfrog the Indians. India's fate now depends on the outcome of the last Pool A match between Great Britain and Ireland. The Indians will have to wait till the evening to know their fate. A Ireland loss or a draw will be enough for India to seal their place in the quarterfinals. The top four teams from each pool will qualify for the knockout round. Needing a win to stay alive in the competition, the Indians meant business and pressed hard on the South African defence from the start. In doing so, India secured two penalty corners in the first two minutes of the match but dragflicker Gurjit Kaur's poor execution continued in the tournament. Still it didn't take India long to open their account and in the fourth minute, Vandana gave her side the lead, tapping in from close range after being set up by Navneet Kaur's great run from the right flank. India kept up the pressure and penetrated the South African circle many times without much success. But seconds from the end of first quarter, a lapse in concentration from the defence cost India dearly as South Africa drew level through Tarryn Glasby, who deflected in a long shot from Taryn Mallett. India had enough time to regain their lead through a penalty corner but wasted the opportunity. Two minutes into the second quarter, Vandana restored India's lead when she deflected in Deep Grace Ekka's flick from their fourth penalty corner. The Indians had three more chances to extend their lead in the second quarter but they couldn't do so. The Rani Rampal-led side got two more penalty corners which they wasted, and then, Neha Goyal's effort from open play was saved by the South Africa goalkeeper. Just like in the first quarter, India gave away their lead seconds away from half time when Hunter found the net from her team's first penalty corner. Two minutes after the change of ends, Neha restored the lead again, deflecting in a Rani hit from a penalty corner as the Indians executed a fine variation. The fragile Indian defence wilted under pressure once again, when South Africa drew level for the third time in the match, through a Marais strike. South Africa enjoyed a good run of play in the initial minutes of final quarter and, in the process, secured three penalty corners quickly, but this time the Indian defence did enough to thwart the dangers. In the 49th minute, a brilliant Vandana saved the day for India when she deflected in Gurjit Kaur's flick from another penalty corner. Thereafter, the Indians fell back and looked contend to keep the possession as South Africa pressed hard. Two minutes from the final hooter, the Indians successfully referred a penalty corner decision given against them.  \n Topic 13: \n \t  Just a few months after Lovlina Borgohain had first stepped out of her village Baramukhia, near Assam's border with Nagaland, she found herself in trouble. It was 2012, and the then 14-year-old boxer was at her first tournament, the sub-junior nationals in Kolkata. She needed a red-corner kit, but did not have one. She asked another girl, who had lost her bout, if she could borrow her kit. \"She agreed but with a condition that I give her my mobile phone,\" Borgohain said in an earlier interview to HT. That phone was her lifeline. It had been only two months since Borgohain had left home to join the boxing programme at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre in Guwahati, more than 300km away, and it was the only way to stay in touch with her family. Borgohain took the hard decision and gave the phone. But she did not get the promised kit. \"You know some incidents in life leave a mark. It still rankles whenever I think of it,\" she said. Perhaps it will not rankle her anymore. Borgohain became only the third boxer from India to win an Olympic medal-after Vijender Singh's 2008 Beijing bronze and her idol Mary Kom's 2012 London bronze-when she was assured of at least a bronze after winning her quarterfinal match against Chinese Taipei's Chen Nien-Chin in Tokyo and moving into the semis. Back home, Lovlina's parents-her father owns a small tea plantation-chose not to watch the quarterfinal bout live. \"We never watch Lovlina's matches live actually,\" said her father Tiken Borgohain over the phone. \"We do watch the highlights later on but it's a bit difficult to watch the bouts live because in that moment when she is in the ring, it gets too exciting for us.\" But they got the news immediately as neighbours poured into the house to congratulate them and their phones began ringing. \"Our district (Golaghat) is still in the Covid red zone but the excitement among all our friends, relatives and neighbours is so much that quite a few people have been visiting to congratulate us,\" Tiken said. Borgohain last met her parents in February in Kolkata, when her mother underwent a kidney transplant there. Borgohain, Tiken said, was fascinated with combat sports from a very early age, inspired by her twin elder sisters Lima and Licha, older to her by four years, who were both into Muay Thai. When she was 11, Borgohain too started training in Muay Thai and Thang-ta, a Manipuri martial art. But in 2012, when she was 14, she was spotted during a scouting run by Padam Boro, the coach who runs the boxing programme at SAI's Guwahati centre. Boro was short of boxers for the upcoming sub-junior nationals in Kolkata. \"I noticed that she had a good height and build for a boxer,\" Boro said over the phone. \"So I gave her a few tests to check her boxing skills. I realised that she could be a very good boxer so I didn't have to think too much to select her.\" It was a break for Borgohain, but she had to leave home and go very far away. The decision was made easy by her mother Mamoni Borgohain, who told her that she must take the opportunity. \"We are three sisters and like in Indian villages there was this constant this talk that there is no son,\" Borgohain said. \"Our father had to stay away from home for months due to work. My mother used to say that we have to do something to change our situation.\" Borgohain went to her first tournament, the sub junior nationals in Kolkata with bare minimum training. \"In Thai boxing you have 1-2 punches (a combination of two punches),\" Borgohain said. \"I was told by the coach, just don't use the kick, and throw as many punches as possible. I did just that.\" It got her a gold, but Borgohain has come a long way from those rookie days. \"At this moment, Lovlina is now technically very sound, in all aspects of her game,\" Boro said. \"She is at a stage now where, whatever tournament she plays in, she can win a medal and can beat any opponent she faces.\" The technical aspect of Borgohain's boxing was on full display in the quarterfinal fight against Chen Nien-Chin, a boxer who has beaten Borgohain in all three of their meetings before this one. Chen Nien-Chin, the 2018 world champion, is stocky and powerful and likes to fight by moving close to her opponent and unleashing a barrage of punches. Borgohain, who is taller and leaner, simply did not allow her to do that. With a stiff jab and a deft footwork, Borgohain was in control of the distance for the entire fight. As Chen Nien-Chin got more and more frustrated, her punches became more reckless and Borgohain capitalized with a series of hooks and straights that made solid connections. \"I had been planning how to beat her. I was not competing against anyone but myself. I enjoyed the bout, it was a fun fight, I played with freedom, without any fear,\" Borgohain said. \"If she fights like she did today, I am certain that she will bring home the Olympic gold,\" Boro said.  \n Topic 14: \n \t 'Ah, I did not see that question coming! but yes, that's the plan' Speaking exclusively to t2, the multitalented Somdev Devvarman shares his take on the GOAT debate, his plans for a music album, his love for egg rolls, and much more! What motivated you to move to the United States as a teenager and what impact did it have on your tennis and your personality? When I was 18, I was the best junior in the country (India). At that age, it was difficult to find an exact pathway to becoming a professional tennis player. I found it pretty challenging to do that from India. One is because most tournaments are in parts of Europe and America, and it is very expensive to travel. To do so without a coach is also hard. How does an 18 or 19-year-old self-reflect after every match? When I joined college at the University of Virginia, the pool was really strong. I got a degree and a scholarship. But I also got to evolve as a person and as a player. I had three coaches, eight or 10 teammates. If we got injured, we had experts to make sure we were fine and back on court. It was the most important part of my tennis life. Those four years really gave me the opportunity to grow, to mature, and become a better player. Tennis is a lonely sport, but to have teammates and be working towards a common goal can work wonders for young people. Earlier this month, Novak Djokovic levelled Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the top of the men's singles Grand Slam honours list. You have played against all three. Who was the hardest to face and can you give us a definitive pick in the GOAT debate? All three of them play very differently. They pose different challenges, beat you in different ways. Roger attacks more than the other two, he has the ability to mesmerise you on court. Rafa beats you with brute force, Novak is tactically much better than you, he does not miss out on any opportunity. In terms of Grand Slams, you would imagine that Novak is the favourite right now. It is safe to say that Roger is past his prime. With Rafa, he is still up there among the top two players on clay, but with the other surfaces, he is more vulnerable than Novak to the next generation. I think Novak has the opportunity to hit 25 or 27 Slams, it does not look like he is slowing down. Novak is willing to do things with himself and his game that nobody else is willing to do. But each of these three is a giant of the game, everyone else is just along for the ride. I am just happy I got to be a part of the same era, that I got the chance to not just watch them, but play against them. In the recent past, you have spoken out against police brutality and racism. Are you disappointed that more Indian athletes do not take a stance on issues of social justice? There is no reason to be disappointed. To each their own. The first thing is to understand that everyone has their own problems in life. I certainly do not expect everyone to see things the way I do, but as long as I have the freedom to see things my way, I am happy enough with that. Probably, the more athletes start becoming self-sufficient in how they want to move their careers forward, the more they might want to be speaking out. Also, keep in mind that these things can be distractions. Professional sport is hard enough without the distractions, which take away your training routine, take away the mindset you need for success. At the same time, as a nation, I do believe it is important for the youth to speak up for what they believe is right. It is not a crime to speak your mind, right? As long as you do it respectfully. Over the last few years, we have seen you write, perform, and release a series of songs. Do you have any plans of releasing an album anytime soon? Ah, I did not see that question coming! But yes, that (releasing an album) is the plan. I am in no rush to do it, to be honest. I have spent a lot of time in the studio, but I have not spent enough time. I want to get my sound right, and I want to figure out exactly how I want to do it. An album is in the making, I have to just get a bunch of the musicians together, probably get a good producer on board, and then see what happens. You spent the early part of your childhood in Calcutta before moving to Chennai. What are your fondest memories of Calcutta and what do you love the most about the city? I love the egg rolls, the chaat... food basically. I did leave when I was eight years old, so probably too young to have clear memories. But those were happy times for me. I remember playing a lot of sports, kicking the ball around or playing cricket. I actually did not play tennis at all. But I like the culture over there, just the general vibe of Calcutta has always been really nice. As a man of many talents, what does the future hold for you? Where do you see yourself in five years' time? I have a hard time looking beyond three weeks! But five years... I will not go there because five years ago I would not have imagined that we would be here. But I hope that I have released at least two albums (in the next five years). And in terms of the other stuff- tennis, coaching, media- who knows! No idea.

While many welcomed the renaming, several of them asked whether the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad and the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi would now be renamed after sportspersons too. Some questioned the way Modi's image dominated a congratulatory graphic put out by the BJP with Dhyan Chand pushed to a corner. \"Puzzle of the day: Find #MajorDhyanChand in the picture below,\" a Twitter user posted. Social media influencer Dhruv Rathee, who lauded the renaming of the award, tweeted: \"Now I hope they can rename Narendra Modi Stadium and Jaitley Stadium also. Remove all politician names.\" Great decision by Modi Govt to rename Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award to Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award. Now I hope they can rename Narendra Modi Stadium and Jaitley Stadium also. Remove all politician names. While the renaming decision is in line with the Modi administration's knack for erasing the names of Nehru-Gandhi family Prime Ministers from government showpieces, its timing appears to have been carefully chosen. The move comes a day after the Indian men's hockey team won bronze at Tokyo - the country's first Olympic hockey medal in 41 years - refocusing national spotlight on the game. Modi said the decision had come under public pressure. \"I have been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. I thank them for their views,\" he tweeted in the afternoon, without naming Rajiv Gandhi. \"Respecting their sentiment, the Khel Ratna Award will hereby be called Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award! Jai Hind!\" Dhyan Chand (1905-79), known as the \"wizard of hockey\", was part of India's gold-winning teams at the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympics. Union ministers and BJP politicians rushed to laud the decision, with cricketer turned parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir telling reporters: \"Awards for sportspersons should be named after sportspersons.\" Fact-checking portal Boomlive reported that some ministers and news outlets shared the image of the Param Vir Chakra, the highest wartime gallantry award, as that of the Khel Ratna Award. Modi had come under fire when the world's largest cricket stadium, in Gujarat, was renamed as the Narendra Modi Stadium last February after a refurbishment. The stadium was originally named after the country's first home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel. The BJP had justified the renaming on the ground that the Modi stadium was only a part of the larger Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave. In 2019, Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium was renamed after the late Union minister Arun Jaitley, who had been Delhi cricket chief - a decision opposed by former sportspersons like Bishan Singh Bedi. With Friday's government decision, the country now has two national sporting awards in Dhyan Chand's name, the other being the Dhyan Chand Award for Lifetime Achievement in Sports and Games. The Khel Ratna is handed out for outstanding performance over the four years immediately preceding the award. The Congress said it welcomed any attempt to honour Dhyan Chand but advised the government not to use his name for petty \"politicking\" and suggested the renaming decision was a ploy to divert attention from the Pegasus snooping allegations and the farmers' agitation. \"Dhyan Chand was a magician of hockey.... We welcome any attempt to honour him, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not have used his name in politicking, to serve his petty political interests,\" party communications chief Randeep Surjewala said. In June 2017, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had questioned the Modi's administration's systematic renaming - mostly after Sangh parivar icons - of government schemes that bore the names of former Congress Prime Ministers. Tharoor had in a tweet listed 23 of the Modi government's schemes and contended they were merely renamed versions of programmes launched by previous Congress or Congress-led governments. \"Why we in @INCIndia insist this is a name-changing government, not a game-changing one!\" Tharoor had said. For instance, the Rajiv Gandhi Vidyutikaran Yojana was renamed as Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation.  \n Topic 16: \n \t While a delirious India was celebrating, Neeraj Chopra had quietly disappeared off camera. When the camera panned across to him again, he was running on the elliptical track that encircled his victory arena, his head held high along the near-empty stands. The Tricolour was billowing behind him. Subedar Neeraj Chopra wasn't running for any spectators. Chopra's lap must have been his message of gratitude to the Indian Army and a nation that had waited so long for this moment. This is not the first time that the Indian Army has displayed guts and glory on the world stage. The Indian armed forces and their heroics in the sporting arena are the stuff of legend. The first sporting icon of the country post-Independence was Major Dhyan Chand, who served in the Punjab Regiment. Milkha Singh, \"The Flying Sikh\" who passed away in June, was recruited as a sepoy in 1951. Paan Singh Tomar of the Bengal Engineers Group represented India in the steeplechase at the Tokyo Asian Games in 1958. Army boxer Padam Bahadur Malla was the first to win a gold medal at the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. Ignacious Tirkey of the Madras Engineering Group of the Indian Army was awarded the Arjuna Award for his outstanding contribution to Indian hockey. The Indian polo team has always been fielded with ace polo players from the 61st Cavalry. The list goes on and on. From a professional point of view, the interest of the Indian Army has been natural in sports such as shooting, mountaineering and sailing. The army operates its Marksmanship Unit in Mhow and the High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg. After Tenzing Norgay, some of the first Indians to climb Mount Everest were from the army, starting with Avtar Singh Cheema. Mountaineer Narendra \"Bull\" Kumar is credited with securing Siachen for India. The Indian Army has a sailing team that is trained at the Army Rowing Node in the College of Military Engineering, Pune. India's armed forces have been at the forefront of producing sportsmen of international pedigree. The army adopts a systematic and structured method with the aim of attaining sporting excellence. Tournaments are held at the battalion, brigade, divisional and command levels in every sporting discipline to seek out champions. These tournaments are intensely fought for the \"naam\" and \"izzat\" of the respective battalions. The best athletes from the tri-services get to represent the defence forces at national-level meets. The Army Sports Control Board (ASCB) was set up in March 1919 on the lines of the British body with the same name. In 1945, the ASCB was merged with all sports organisations of the three services, and the Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) was formed. The SSCB focuses on 18 inter-services sports events, and has produced international medallists such as shooter Vijay Kumar, boxers Suranjoy Singh, Dingko Singh and Kaur Singh, race-walker Chand Ram, and hockey stars Manohar Topno, Tirkey and Sylvanus Dung Dung among others. But the going hadn't been too good for Indian sports for a very long time. The Indian Army top brass felt that the armed forces should do something about it. Thus, the programme Mission Olympics was launched in 2001. Three years later, an army man, Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, climbed the podium at Athens, winning a silver medal in shooting. Eight years later, in London, Havildar Vijay Kumar emulated him, winning a silver in shooting. The Mission Olympic wing has five nodes: the Army Sports Institute (Pune), the Army Marksmanship Unit (Mhow), the Army Rowing Node (Pune), the Army Yachting Node (Mumbai) and the Army Equestrian Node (Meerut), which are working towards producing world-class sportsmen in archery, boxing, shooting, weightlifting, wrestling, equestrian and rowing. It comes as no surprise that a sizeable part of India's Olympic contingent at Tokyo was made up of athletes from the Services. The Army Sports Institute at Pune has changed the face of the country's sporting culture. It is a unique, multi-disciplinary sports institute that imparts training in seven sports: archery, athletics, boxing, diving, wrestling, fencing and weightlifting. The training is imparted by renowned foreign and Indian coaches and qualified physical trainers. They are supported by a team of specialists in sports medicine, sports physiology, sports psychology, bio-mechanics and nutrition. The institute provides modern training infrastructure, equipment, accommodation and environment, and a sports sciences centre. When the army's athletes failed to win any medals at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics of 2016, the planning for the Tokyo Olympics began on a war footing. It was that same year that Chopra joined the Indian Army as a junior commissioned officer. The army has made a concerted effort to nurture and produce sportspersons, providing equipment, support staff, coaching, accommodation, and a proper diet to its athletes. In other words, everything is taken care of, and then there's job security as well. Another factor that the army's athletes swear by is discipline. Chopra says he got a sense of self-reliance after joining the army. \"My father is a farmer, mother a housewife and I live in a joint family.... For me, it's a sort of a relief because now I'm able to help my family financially, besides continuing with my training.\" With Subedar Neeraj Chopra of the Indian Army's Rajputana Rifles winning the lone gold for India at Tokyo, \"Citius, Altius, Fortius - Communis\", the newly modified motto of the Olympics, could add another word, \"Extremus\" - farthest, or situated at the end, edge or tip - and raise a toast to the sportsmanship of the Indian Armed Forces. * Deepam Chatterjee is a former captain of the Indian Army  \n Topic 17: \n \t  Here are today's top news, analysis and opinion at 5pm.

That's the piece of history Mirabai Chanu wrote for India as she thrust a 115kg barbell up above her with the practiced ease of a world beater. At the Tokyo International Forum, early in the morning of the first day after Olympics was declared open, Chanu won the silver in 49kg women's weightlifting with a combined total of 202kg. It marked the first time that India has won a medal on the opening day of an Olympics, signaling what may turn out to be a landmark Games for the Indian contingent. Chanu lifted 87kg in snatch and 115kg - just four kilos less than her own world record-in the clean & jerk, behind only China's Hou Zhihui's total of 210kg. Zhihui is the world record holder in the category. Chanu's coach Vijay Sharma's booming voice resonated through the hall, as the diminutive lifter from Manipur ran to the backroom after her lifts to wrap herself around her 6ft2 father figure. Chanu is now only the second weightlifter from India to win an Olympic medal, after Karnam Malleswari won bronze at the 2000 Sydney Games. Someone from the coaching staff handed her a phone-on the other end was Jeremy Lalrinnunga and other teammates at their training base in Patiala, screaming and dancing with joy. Chanu broke into a jig herself. \"Balle balle kiya!\" she said, laughing. After the medal ceremony, Chanu came out to the media area, the silver around her neck. She held it and kissed it. \"Medal bahut bhari hai, (the medal's quite heavy),\" she said, beaming throughout. \"I wanted to win the gold, I tried, but I will accept the silver. \"I am very happy, I have been dreaming of this for the past five years. I am very proud of myself right now. The first thing I will do is party!\" \"Could not have asked for a happier start to @Tokyo2020! India is elated by Mirabai Chanu's stupendous performance... Congratulations to her for winning the Silver medal in weightlifting. Her success motivates every Indian,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. \"Heartiest congratulations to Mirabai Chanu for starting the medal tally for India in the Tokyo Olympics 2020 by winning silver medal in weightlifting,\" Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter. If not for Chanu, this day could have gone very differently for India. Or rather, it would have gone along more familiar lines. Indian athletes were involved in four medal events on the opening day, including Chanu's event. In each of these events, the Indians were strong contenders- Saurabh Chaudhary and Abhishek Verma, both ranked in the top three in the world, in 10m air pistol; Elavenil Valarivan (seeded No 1 for Tokyo 2020) and world record holder Apurvi Chandela in 10m air rifle; and women's world No 1 archer Deepika Kumari and Praveen Jadhav in mixed team archery. Yet, despite their billing, it was not their day and none of them could make it to the medal rounds, sparking fears that this could be yet another Olympics where India would have to wait anxiously for a medal. Five long years At the 2016 Rio Games, where Chanu had made her Olympics debut, everything had gone wrong for her. Of the six attempts given to lifters - three in snatch, three in clean & jerk - she had managed to complete just one lift in snatch. Three months ago at the Asian Championships, she had almost relived that horror, with two no-lifts in snatch. It's the kind of thing that ends careers. Not for Chanu. \"We have spoken so many times about that day in the Rio Olympics in these five years,\" said coach Sharma. \"Every time I would tell her that she is now a different athlete. It is that incident that has brought us where we are today.\" In Tokyo, if she was still haunted by those memories of Rio, she did not show it. From the moment her event started, Chanu's body language was confident and relaxed. On her ears she wore gold earrings in the shape of the Olympic logo, gifted to her by her mother after her Rio experience. For her first attempt - 84kg in snatch - she stepped to the stage and bowed to the bar. Then, in one clean motion, Chanu had cleared the lift. She flashed her big smile. She was in control. She was ready to script her extraordinary tale of redemption. For her next lift, she cleared 87kg with comfort. She beamed. Only Zhihui, who also holds the world record for snatch, was lifting more. Chanu could not finish her last snatch, where she attempted 89, more than she had ever done. It didn't matter much, because next up was clean & jerk, which Chanu has made her own. She cleared 110kg on her first attempt with such consummate ease that it looked like she was in training. By the time she was going for her second lift, set at 115kg, the entire field except Zhihui had already fallen away. In the end, the 7kg difference between Chanu's best snatch (87kg) and Zhihui's best (94kg) decided the medal. \"The amount of discipline and commitment she has shown is extraordinary. You see how mentally strong she was today. That comes only with great hard work,\" Sharma said. \"During these rough times of the pandemic, when lives have come to an abrupt halt and mere survival has become an isolating task, victories such as yours will serve as a small reminder of the joy that hope and perseverance can bring,\" read a letter addressed to Chanu by Abhinav Bindra, India's only Olympic gold medallist, who posted it on Twitter. From Rio to the silver in Tokyo was a journey that involved meticulous training, a psychologist, fixing a bad back and realigning her posture with the help of Aaron Horschig, a former weightlifter who is now a renowned physical therapist and strength coach in the US, winning the world championship in 2017, gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games a bronze at the 2020 Asian Championships and becoming the world No 1. In a way, a medal in Tokyo was always within her strong grasp. But when it came-on a day when India were contenders in three other medal events but did not win in any of them-Chanu's joy was infectious and may just be what the young Indian contingent needs as inspiration.  \n Topic 20: \n \t This wasn't for the faint-hearted, for sure. And if you happened to be one, it was better if you had stayed away from your TV set between 2:45pm and 2:51pm on Wednesday afternoon. What happened in those nerve-wracking six minutes at the Makuhari Messe Hall's wrestling arena A, on Mat B in Tokyo, set the pulse racing. An Indian freestyle wrestler, from a small, long-neglected village in Haryana, waged a battle of a lifetime and scripted a comeback for the ages. Unassuming and quiet, Ravi Dahiya is a product of nowjailed wrestling superstar Sushil Kumar's iconic Chhatrasal academy in North West Delhi's Model Town area. On Wednesday, Dahiya forced his way into the gold medal match in men's freestyle 57kg category. Dahiya, ranked No. 4 in the United World Wrestling's (UWW) ranking charts, will face Russian Olympic Committee's (ROC) Zavur Uguev, a twotime world champion, in the final on Thursday afternoon. Dahiya is only the second Indian wrestler after Sushil's London 2012 heroics to enter the final of the wrestling competitions at the Olympic Games. Wednesday's show also confirmed a fourth medal for India. Trailing 2-9 in his semifinal clash against Kazakhstan's Nurislam Sunyaev, World Championships medallist, and with 50 seconds left on the clock for the bout to end, 30-year-old Dahiya summoned all his powers and experience to turn the tables on his rival in a dramatic way, clinching the issue by 'pinfall', even as the scores showed the Kazakh leading 9-7. In that final minute of the contest, Dahiya started reducing the deficit by first pushing Sunyaev 'out of bounds' (off the mat) and then tripping him to complete a three-point move. The Kazakh complained of a muscle pull and took the medical timeout, ostensibly to disturb Dahiya's rhythm. With the scoreline still favouring the Kazakh at 9-5, Dahiya went for the singledrive leg attack and scored a twopoint takedown before converting to a pin, where he snapped Sunyaev's shoulders and kept them fixed to the mat to be declared winner 'by fall'. Dahiya, two-time Asian champion (2020, 2021) and a bronze winner at the World Championships in 2019, led the first scoring period of three minutes 2-1 after executing a two-point takedown of Sunyaev. However, it was the Kazakh who completely changed the complexion of the bout in the final period after performing an astonishing eight-point 'fitele' (twirling the opponent on his back multiple times with great speed and perfection) following an ankle lock on Ravi. Within seconds, Sunyaev raced to a 9-2 lead and the contest looked over for Dahiya. Another spin by the Kazakh would have ended the contest. Dahiya has staged several such fightbacks in his career. In the Polish Open ranking tournament in Warsaw in June, he went on to win a bout 18-8 from a seemingly impossible situation when he trailed 0-8 with just 60 seconds to go. Dahiya had entered the lastfour stage after defeating Bulgaria's Georgi Valentinov 14-4 in the quarterfinals and Colombia's Oscar Eduardo Tigreros Urbano 13-2 in the opening round. Deepak, Anshu fight for bronze The other two Indian challengers, World No. 2 Deepak Punia (86kg) and woman wrestler Anshu Malik (57kg), will fight for the bronze on Thursday after qualifying for the repechage round. World Championships silver medallist Punia's defence was demolished by former world champion David Taylor of the US in the men's freestyle 86kg semifinal bout. The American won 10-0 on technical superiority, completing the formalities in just 191 seconds. Malik lost her opening bout to Bulgaria's double World medallist Iryna Kurachkina 2-8 in the women's 57kg category. Since Kurachkina made it to the title clash, Malik will get a shot at the bronze through repechage round. Times View First-time Olympian Ravi Kumar's success is a shining example of hard work prevailing over adversity. It also underlines that relative inexperience need not necessarily be a hurdle to success.  \n Topic 21: \n \t Shahabad, about 170km from Delhi, is a town like any other in Haryana. Parents prefer girls who keep their dupattas firmly in place, come home before dark and marry before they get too opinionated. Yet some girls have managed to trade their modest salwar kameezes for shorts and the rolling-pin for a hockey stick. All courtesy a patch of 91.4m x 55m astro turf at the Shahabad Markanda hockey stadium that has become a nursery for Indian hockey in the last three decades. Now famous as the stomping ground of current hockey captain Rani Rampal, Shahabad has produced several other national and international-level players, including Rani's teammates in the Olympic team Navjot Kaur and Navneet Kaur and former India men's team captain Sandeep Singh. Rani and her team's performance this week may just have made the path less arduous for girls like 19-year-old Parashdeep Kaur from Sulakhni village who exudes confidence as she darts from one end of the stadium to the other. “It is my dream to represent India in the Olympics as a drag flicker,” she says. (Drag flick is a scoring technique.) And she's putting in the hard work. Parashdeep is among the 300 girls and boys who train at the stadium every day come rain, shine or pandemic. Girls' team coach Neha says there is a growing interest among parents to send their daughters to train at Shahabad. “I have received 15-20 calls just this week, some from other states, seeking a place for their daughter at our stadium but I had to refuse,” she says. There's simply no more room. On most days the stadium is packed to the rafters as children practise in two shifts —from 5:30am to 7:30am and then in the afternoon from 4pm to 7pm. There's nothing fancy about the facilities. The stadium has a couple of rooms for an office and some rudimentary gym equipment. It has neither provision for a hostel accommodation for children living away from Shahabad, nor does it provide food like it used to earlier. Yet the enthusiasm among children and their parents remains unwavering. Government coach Sukhwinder Singh, who is training another 300 girls and boys at a ground near a local school, says demand has outstripped facilities and the area needs better infrastructure. “Our ground does not have an astro turf but yet parents want us to take in their children. If we refuse to take a child, they start crying and pleading,” he says. Hockey was not always this popular, especially in a cricket-crazy country like India. Veteran coach Baldev Singh, credited for training Rani and nearly 60 other international players during his 20-year stint at Shahabad, recalls spending hours convincing parents to send girls for practice. “I had to become a part of their family. If they fell ill, I visited them, if they didn't have enough money, I provided milk or fruits, and if their parents were reluctant, I would try and talk sense to them,” he says. The 69-year-old says that initially his attempts at establishing a girls' team was akin to a scandal. “But when the girls started performing at the national and international level, people shut up,” he says. Even now Parashdeep is the only girl from her village who plays the sport and has been training for five years. “People keep telling my father that he should get me married. They comment on my clothes and the fact that I leave at 4am for practice but my family is very supportive.” Loveleen, 14, who has been playing since she was in class 6, says she is addicted to the game. She plays as a 'deader' who has to stop the penalty shot strategically so that the striker can hit a goal. Pressures of “settling down” might be on the mind of nosy relatives and neighbours but not her. “I want to play for India like Rani (Rampal) didi,” she says. Coach Neha says that the mindset is slowly changing. “Even if the parents do not have enough food for themselves, they make sure the children get a good diet,” she says. Coach Baldev feels Indian hockey has come out of “ventilator support.” He adds, “We must use the momentum that the Olympics have brought to invest in better infrastructure and coaches for the future.” The Indian women's hockey team which narrowly missed out on a medal in Tokyo, need not despair. The fiery 16 have already ignited a passion in a million minds and hearts.  \n Topic 22: \n \t “You brought the dreams of a billion+ Indians to life and we couldn't be happier to treat you to free Domino's pizza for life.” This timely tweet from the quick service restaurant brand came after Mirabai Chanu – who won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics — said in a TV interview that one of the first few things she wanted to do following the podium finish was to eat a pizza. Chanu's performance has set a flurry of brands wanting to associate with the 26-year-old weightlifter ever since she made history on Saturday. Nearly a dozen brands have sent feelers to Chanu's management company IOS Sports & Entertainment over the weekend, said Neerav Tomar, its managing director. “We are getting queries from not only nutrition and sports-related brands, but also personal care, beverage and regional brands. These are for endorsements, appearances or digital associations,” Tomar said. “Her medal has changed things overnight.” IOS plans to formalise two-three deals in the coming weeks once the champion in the women's 49-kg weightlifting category returns. So far, Chanu has had endorsement deals with Adidas and Mobil oil. Now, her endorsement fee is expected to double, albeit from a very low base. Over the last couple of days, brands such as Domino's, Britannia, Thums Up, Swiggy, Amul and VLCC have been making a beeline to associate with her win. “Even as we prepare to give #Mirabai-Chanu a hero's welcome and let her eat pizzas to her heart's content, our Imphal team went to her house to congratulate her family,” Pratik Pota, chief executive at Jubilant Food-Works, said in a tweet. Jubilant operates Domino's Pizza in India. The Twitter post from Domino's official handle tagging Chanu went viral and generated a string of comments, including by some consumers who said they would only buy Domino's Pizza from now on. Coca-Cola-owned Thums Up, which has a worldwide partnership with the Olympic Games, linked her win to its ad tagline 'PalatDe' across its social media messages. It is the longer-term associations, not momentary tie-ups, that will benefit both brands and the athlete, industry observers said. “Brands look at any opportunity to stay relevant and, in a country traditionally starved of sports beyond cricket, anyone who wins becomes a star overnight,” said Lloyd Mathias, an angel investor and business strategist. “So, it's a fairly positive thing to do, as long as the brand can find ways to associate for a slightly longer term instead of just that moment.” Dairy brand Amul, which is supporting the Indian Olympic Association, has also felicitated Chanu's family, chairman RS Sodhi said. “We encourage sports persons and celebrate moments of national pride like this,” he said. Industry experts said it would be difficult to bridge the wide gap between noncricket athletes and cricketers for brand associations and that comparisons may not be fair. Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli, for example, is learnt to charge ?4.5-5 crore a day for brand-related promotions – be it for the filming of TV commercials, appearances, or for meeting fans. In comparison, non-cricketing athletes charge anywhere between ?30 lakh and ?1.5 crore, depending on their popularity and visibility. “Brand associations are a function of the exposure the athlete gets on a continuous level, consistent performance, and visibility,” said Tuhin Mishra, managing director at sports marketing company Baseline Ventures, which represents badminton player PV Sindhu. Biscuit maker Britannia posted congratulations on its Instagram account, thanking Chanu for “lifting our spirits with the taste of sweet victory.” Personal care brand VLCC put up a picture of the sportsperson with a caption, “Silver is beautiful. Congratulations on the historic win.” Food delivery platform Swiggy also leveraged Chanu's historic win to drive more orders by tweeting: “It's time for mithai, barfi and lots of pedhas.” A mid-sized hotel in Udaipur tweeted that it would offer her free lifetime stay at the property. With other athletes including Mary Kom, PV Sindhu and Manika Batra also keeping India's medal hopes alive, many more brand deals would be in the offing, said a sports marketing executive. Coca-Cola, Hero Motocorp, Amul, Mobile Premier League (MPL), Visa and Byju's are among the brands that have onboarded broadcast rights holder Sony Pictures Sports Network as sponsors for the Olympics.  \n Topic 23: \n \t In Fiercely Female, Sundeep Mishra's new book on Dutee Chand, hunger is a recurring theme. It is inescapable when you are the fourth of seven children in a family with a monthly income of less than Rs3000. Getting a daily meal of dal-rice was a challenge, leave alone the high-quality diet that athletes from developed countries have enjoyed all their lives. Yet Chand still competed at the highest international level – until she was diagnosed with hyperandrogenism, the natural production of high levels of testosterone which could give her body an extra boost of strength. With little thought of how it would devastate her life, she was dropped by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) whose leaders, like Adille Sumariwalla, seemed more concerned with maintaining their status with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), than supporting their own athletes. But Chand fought back, managing to be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She argued she was being treated worse than athletes who took performance enhancing drugs, who were punished but then allowed back to compete. Mishra writes: “For the athletes producing testosterone naturally without taking supplements, it was like telling them, 'You are a different species; it's wonderful. But sorry, you are not allowed to compete…” Chand won, and hopes to win a medal in the Tokyo Olympics. But the issue is not going away. Allegations of unfairness are being made against many women athletes accused of having unfair advantages because of their natural condition. A particular focus is New Zealand's weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who is competing after completing her gender transition. Such athletes are said to violate the Olympics vision of fairness, with sports an arena of pure ability. But this is a notably one-sided vision, usually only invoked when an athlete from the developed world is faced competitors from the developing world whose abilities can somehow be labelled unfair. Such as with East African runners whose natural physique combined with high-altitude homes that develop greater lung power helps them with endurance events. There have been grumblings about the unfairness of competing with them, and the immense attention that any white athlete who appears able to challenge them immediately gets is an indication of how these feelings have never quite gone away. In the early years of the Modern Olympics, fairness fuelled the debate over amateurs and professionals. The former were said to embody the Olympic spirit, while the latter were only in it for the money. These neatly reserved the Games for rich athletes who could afford the time to train, while excluding those like the poor, but immensely versatile Jim Thorpe, who was stripped of his two gold medals in the 1912 Games after it emerged that he had played semi-professional baseball. Thorpe, not coincidentally, was Native American. Allegations of unfairness against athletes like Chand follow the same tactic. At her hearing she was supported by Madeleine Pape, an Australian Olympic athlete who had become an academic researching gender in sports. Pape pointed to how athletes from countries that gave them access to every advantage, including good childhood diets, and then access to good training and facilities, were already at a huge advantage. “So when the IAAF focused on a single biological trait in the Hyperandrogenism Regulations, it completely failed to tell the world in how many different ways the world of track and field was inherently 'un-level',” writes Mishra. Equipment is another issue. Cycling might seem like a sport suited to competitors from developing countries, where bicycles are imperative transport. Yet the sport is dominated by countries who can support the huge cost of creating the specialised cycles used for most Olympic events. Australia's Electron Pro bikes for Tokyo 2020, for example, took over 4,500 hours of development, and will cost $18,000 each. Arguably, the real competition in Cycling happens in the design labs of rich countries, but somehow questions of fairness are rarely raised. Another example can be seen in the competing fortunes of wrestling and Modern Pentathlon. The former is an ancient sport which requires no special equipment. Athletes compete with their most basic asset, their bodies, and it is dominated by competitors from the developed world. The latter was created purely for the Olympics and involves running, swimming, fencing, shooting and horse riding, the latter three disciplines all involving immense cost. When Mexico's Ismael Hernandez Uscanga won bronze in Rio in 2016 he was the first medallist from outside the developed world or the former Soviet Union and its allies, where competitors nearly all have support from their militaries (as does Uscanga). Yet in 2013 it was wrestling that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to drop from the Games, while Modern Pentathlon was not challenged, despite its absurdly high barriers to competition. It was widely suggested that this was because the vicepresident of its international federation is the son of Juan Samaranch, the revered former president of the IOC, and clearly someone well versed with its politics. The backlash against the decision to drop wrestling was strong enough to get the IOC to reverse its decision, in a rare real victory for fairness in the Games. It was an example of how the one-sided use of fairness by the developed world can be combated, starting with its use against women athletes like Chand and Hubbard.  \n Topic 24: \n \t Scheduled to end August 13, Parliament's monsoon session has been disrupted by the row over alleged surveillance through the use of the Pegasus spyware. Accusing Lok Sabha TV of shutting it out, the Opposition, which has been seeking a discussion on the Pegasus issue and farm laws that triggered the farmer agitation, says its protests are only shown on screens inside the House, and not beamed across the country. On Friday, when Lok Sabha last met, LSTV showed Opposition protests for all of 72 seconds - House proceedings lasted a total of 45 minutes over two sittings that day. Opposition MPs, however, were not in their seats, except during the first few minutes when Speaker Om Birla paid tribute to the victims of the 1945 Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings and congratulated India's wrestler Ravi Kumar Dahiya for winning a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Members of the Congress, DMK, Left parties and TMC were in the well of the House, protesting during the proceedings which lasted from 11 am to 11.21 am. When the House met again at noon, the government passed two key Bills - The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to do away with the policy of retrospective taxation and The Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to provide for the establishment of a university in the Union Territory of Ladakh - amidst slogan shouting by Opposition MPs. The live telecast of the proceedings did not really reveal what exactly happened inside Lok Sabha. Sources in LSTV said the TV screens in the House are part of the CCTV system, while the camera feed used by the channel is different. \"LSTV is responsible for only what is telecast. CCTVs or its cameras are not under our control,\" sources said. Manoj K Arora, Editor-in-Chief cum Chief Executive of LSTV, said the channel follows rules laid down for it. \"The LSTV transmission is as per the rules which say it should be a true reflection of what's happening inside the House,\" Arora told The Indian Express. The channel, sources said, is expected to provide an overall view, but when the Speaker or the Chair speaks or the Prime Minister speaks, it has to focus on them. The rules also say the focus should be on the member who is speaking, be it for question-answer, matters of public importance or participation in a debate. On Friday, The Indian Express tracked proceedings, minute by minute, from the press gallery inside Lok Sabha and the telecast on LSTV. This is what really happened: * 11 am: Speaker Om Birla enters the House. He recalls the destruction when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed 76 years ago. He calls for a pledge to live in peace and harmony. * 11.02: Speaker congratulates wrestler Ravi Kumar Dahiya for winning a silver medal in the Tokyo Olympics. MPs join him by thumping the desk. * 11.03: Speaker starts Question Hour. Starts with a question relating to institutional deliveries by states during the pandemic. Union Ministers Bhupender Yadav, Pralhad Joshi, Smriti Irani are present. Opposition MPs leave their seats. Congress MP Manickam Tagore is the first to walk towards the treasury benches, shouting slogans. He is followed by TMC's Aparupa Poddar, Abu Taher Khan and Mahua Moitra, Congress's Jasbir Singh Gill, Benny Behanan, Hibi Eden, T N Prathapan and Dean Kuriakose. * 11.04: Mahua Moitra raises a placard and the slogan of \"Pegasus pe jaanch karo (investigate Pegasus)\". * 11.05: DMK's T R Baalu, NC MP Hasnain Masoodi rise from their seats. Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu shout slogans against the government. * 11.06: Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya says his junior minister Dr Bharati Pawar is going to answer a question. Urges the Opposition to listen to \"a tribal\" woman minister. Opposition continues to protest. * 11.07: Pawar starts her reply. Opposition MPs try to block her. Prathapan holds a placard, seeking a SC-monitored probe into Pegasus, before her. DMK's Veeraswamy Kalanidhi holds another placard. * 11.12: Speaker takes up another question. More Opposition MPs join the protest in the well. SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur carries a placard, seeking justice for farmers, and a wheat flower bunch. BJP's Jamyang Tsering Namgyal has a question on environmental issues in the Himalayan region. Bhupender Yadav replies. * 11.13: Congress MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla leads sloganeering against the government. * 11: 14: Opposition MPs are now standing around the desk of reporters in the well of the House. * 11.15: As Bhupender Yadav replies, Prathapan and Kalanidhi try to block him with placards. The minister's face is not visible on the screens inside. * 11.17: Hibi Eden takes the lead in slogan shouting, says the government is scared. * 11.18: Minister Jitender Singh replies to a question on exploration of ocean resources. * 11.19: Speaker calls for three questions. * 11.20: Sukhbir Singh Badal on his feet with a placard in support of farmers. Smriti Irani replies to BJD's Sarmistha Sethi's query on the national nutrition mission. Opposition intensifies slogan shouting. * 11.21: Speaker asks MPs to return to their seats and hold a discussion. Adjourns proceedings till noon. * Noon: BJP's Rajendra Agrawal takes the Chair. Mahua Moitra leads TMC MPs to the well of the House. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury rises to say: \"It has been three weeks... the House has not been running properly. No work is done.\" At this, Ministers Pralhad Joshi and Arjun Ram Meghwal protest. * 12.01 pm: Chowdhury says: \"I want to give a warning to the government.. Mann ki Baat... What you are doing is not right. You cannot be intoxicated with power.\" * 12.02: Meghwal: \"It's wrong. We are ready for discussion. We have listed Covid management to discuss.\" * 12.03: The Chair calls for tabling the papers as listed in the agenda. Meghwal tables the papers. Ministers table action taken reports and other statements. * 12.04: Gogoi leads the sloganeering. Opposition MPs surround the Secretary General's table and raise slogans. The Chair asks them to return to their seats. * 12.07: Opposition MPs raise slogans in Bangla: \"Khela hobe, khela hobe.\" Congress MP Vishnu Pramod leads them. * 12.09: Opposition chants slogans in Tamil, seeking a debate. * 12.11: Meghwal presents the Business Advisory Committee report for next week. * 12.12: Mahua Moitra leads slogans against the government. * 12.13: Chair calls Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to move the Taxation Amendment Bill.

The Chair puts the Bill to vote, clause by clause, and it is passed. * 12.19: The Chair calls Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to move the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill 2021. * 12.20: Pradhan moves the Bill for consideration and passage. He makes opening remarks. Opposition intensifies its slogan shouting. * 12.24: Pradhan takes his seat. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury says: \"We have raised a genuine demand to roll back the farmers' Bills.\" Meghwal says: \"You are responsible for not having a debate.\" The Bill is put to vote and passed. Opposition MPs shout: \"Jawab do, jawab do (give us a reply)\". House adjourns for the day to meet again on Monday.  \n Topic 25: \n \t \"Sattar minute, sattar minute hai tumhare paas...\". Shah Rukh Khan's iconic lines from Chak De! India is remembered to date. The expressions, the patriotic feeling and of course, Shah Rukh Khan makes the monologue the heart of Chak De! India. The film is more of an emotion than a movie. Written by Jaideep Sahni, the Shimit Amin directorial venture, that will turn 15 on August 10, has become especially relevant now thanks to the exemplary performances by the women's and men's hockey teams at Tokyo Olympics 2020. The may have lost the semis against Argentina at Tokyo Olympics 2020, but the sounds of Chak De! India kept resonating in our ears as the team made it to their maiden Olympic semis. No mean feat. On the other hand, the men's hockey team won the bronze at the Games, 41 years after Moscow Olympics 1980. So, since hockey is the mood of the nation now, we dedicate our Throwback Thursday to the brilliance that was Chak De! India and what makes it a cult classic. HOW CHAK DE INDIA TACKLES SEXISM, RACISM, STEREOTYPING AND ENCOURAGED WOMEN EMPOWERMENT The story creates a bridge between the women athletes in the country and the audience. Chak De! India narrates a fictional story about the Indian women's national field hockey team, that was loosely inspired by the Indian team's win at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. SRK impresses us with his performance as the captain of the Indian team, Kabir Khan, who misses a do-or-die penalty shootout against arch-rival Pakistan in the final of a world championship. The loss created national outrage and triggered charges of match-fixing, leading to his ouster. Years later, he returns as the coach of the women's hockey team, and as he pushes them towards their goal, he redeems his lost honour too. Chak De! India managed to arouse many emotions, including that of patriotism, anger against sexism and, of course, an insight into the prevalent racism in the country. SRK's determination to make 11 women work together and play together, erasing the idea of state and inculcating the idea of one nation, touches your heart. This was the first film in many years that concentrated on a sport other than cricket. Moreover, it concentrated on a women's game, something so rare in the country. At the same time, the film broke many stereotypes. It was a film way ahead of its time. PERFORMANCES THAT STAYED WITH YOU FOR YEARS Minus the occasional hamming, Shah Rukh Khan as Kabir Khan goes out of the way to touch your heart with his performance. Right from the hurt he felt when he was ousted from the men's hockey team to the pride in his eyes when the women's hockey team wins, SRK beautifully portrays all the emotions with extreme ease. But, Chak De! India is not a one-man show. The star cast included Vidya Malavade, Anaitha Nair, Tanya Abrol, Shilpa Shukla, Arya Menon, Shubhi Mehta, Chitrashi Rawat, Kimi Laldawla, Masochon Zimik, Sandia Furtado, Nichola Sequeira, Sagarika Ghatge, Kimberly Miranda, Raynia Mascerhanas, Nisha Nair. Although all the girls were newcomers, their performance managed to impress. Many have become actors in the Hindi film industry, all thanks to the film. Shah Rukh Khan as Kabir Khan in Chak De India! THE DIALOGUES One of the things that definitely come to mind when we talk about Chak De! India are the dialogues. The first dialogue that to date has stayed with many Indians who watched the film is Sattar Minute. SRK's monologue where he addressed all the members of the Indian women's hockey team in the dressing room was one of the most inspiring cinematic moments we've ever seen. Another dialogue that remains etched in our minds is when SRK made the girls realise that they represent the country and not for their states. The dialogue goes, \"Mujhe states ki naam na sunayi dete hai, na dhikai dete hai. Sirf ek mulk ka naam sunayi deta hai, I-N-D-I-A.\" Power-packed performances, strong dialogues and a plot that has stayed with us since 2007, Chak De! India is a masterpiece. Here's celebrating Chak De! India and more importantly, our Indian women's and men's hockey teams for their exemplary performances.
