Specifically, the study looks on health-related financial uncertainty and how patients view access to medications as cost prohibitive. It also studied perceptions of health systems and specialty pharmacies.\nWhat data are used? \n\nTrellisRx did not disclose raw interview data. For Romo, LK et al study, I have requested UMass for access to full article. Currently, I only have the abstract information.\n\n\n## How are the data collected? What methods are used?\nData was collected through 17 participants using semi-structured data interviews for Romo, LK et. al \nTrellisRx had 20 participants involving established health plans and hospital administrators and it used blinded and unblinded expert interviews, and blinded interview participants.\nWhat are the findings of the study?\nRomo, LK study found significant negative effects on physical and mental issues, such as depression, on participants with health-related financial uncertainty. Participants worried about the cost of seeking care and the financial burden of receiving such care.  This study found that effective communication to participants help manage this financial uncertainty, including sharing information, social networking and establishing emotional support.\nTrellisRx found numerous misperceptions between health systems and health payors. This is especially useful in finding common ground between these two systems. The studies found that both parties have a common objective of improving health outcomes and ensuring patient access and affordability to access quality care. It is very interesting that both parties have a lot of common ground, including an agreement that the rising cost of drugs in unsustainable. \n\n\n## What's your take on it?\nIt is common knowledge that the complex US healthcare system needs to improve. The financial burden of accessing healthcare is creating a toll on an individual’s physical and mental health. \nMore research questions:\n\n          1.\tHow do patients perceive access to specialty health care, including specialty medicines?\n          2.\tHow do prescribers and health systems perceive patient’s ability to access healthcare?\n          3.\tHow to quantify health disparities on specialty care? \n          4.\tWhat factors would patients consider in accessing specialty care?\n          5.\tHow can providers help break down barriers to improve health equity?\n\n## REFERENCES:\n\n          1.
