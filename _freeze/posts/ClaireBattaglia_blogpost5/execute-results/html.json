This is primarily because the survey question doesn't ask specifically about respondents' feelings about anything, meaning that a typical valid response doesn't contain either positive or negative sentiment.\n\nI plan to create my own dictionary at some point but for this post I will be attempting to analyze my corpus using Structural Topic Modeling (STM). This method of analysis will allow me to understand both the prevalence of topics across my corpus and the content (i.e. words used to talk about) those topics. Importantly, STM will allow me to analyze the responses alongside some covariates of interest. The two that I am particularly interested in are ZIP Code and annual household income. I expect that at least the *prevalence* of topics will vary by these two covariates, if not the *content*. Keeping the long term goal of this analysis in mind, it makes a tremendous difference if respondents recommending a particular change to the food system are concentrated in a single ZIP Code or income bracket or distributed across the city/over all income brackets.\n\n## Creating My Document Feature Matrix\n\nI created a DFM in a previous post but I'll create a new one here because the one I previously created doesn't contain the covariates I'm interested in.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load tidy data\nload(\"CFA_tidy.RData\")\n\n# create dfm\ndfm_change <- dfm(tokens(CFA_tidy$change),\n             tolower = TRUE,\n             remove = stopwords(\"en\"),\n             remove_punct = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: '...' should not be used for tokens() arguments; use 'tokens()' first.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: 'remove' is deprecated; use dfm_remove() instead\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get dimensions\ndim(dfm_change)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  215 1146\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt contains 215 rows (the responses, called documents here) and 1,146 columns (all the words that appear in the corpus).\n\n<aside> When I first attempted to build a STM, I noticed that the `stm()` function automatically removed *NA* values but that that created problems in later functions. I went back to my tidy dataset and removed all rows that contained any *NA* values to try and address that. Of the 389 respondents, only 215 answered every question. </aside>\n\nNow I'll take a quick look at the two covariates I am interested in: ZIP Code and annual household income.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# zip\ntable(CFA_tidy$zip)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n59701 59801 59802 59803 59804 59808 59821 59823 59825 59826 59833 59846 59847 \n    1    85    62    20     9    15     1     5     4     1     2     1     5 \n59860 59864 59868 59908 \n    1     1     1     1 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# income\ntable(CFA_tidy$income)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nBetween $100,000 and $249,999   Between $25,000 and $34,999 \n                           55                            21 \n  Between $35,000 and $49,999   Between $50,000 and $99,999 \n                           37                            66 \n                Over $250,000                 Under $25,000 \n                            8                            28 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Correlated Topic Model\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# build correlated topic model\nctm_change <- stm(dfm_change, K = 5,\n                       verbose = FALSE, init.type = \"Spectral\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in dfm2stm(x, docvars, omit_empty = TRUE): Dropped empty document(s):\ntext96\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get summary\nsummary(ctm_change)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nA topic model with 5 topics, 214 documents and a 1146 word dictionary.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTopic 1 Top Words:\n \t Highest Prob: affordable, local, land, less, gardens, access, farm \n \t FREX: less, meals, affordable, land, communities, county, dairy \n \t Lift: boulevards, less, meals, 2-5x, accessed, acquisition, additional \n \t Score: affordable, land, use, affordability, less, boulevards, raised \nTopic 2 Top Words:\n \t Highest Prob: local, farmers, market, support, ag, produce, winter \n \t FREX: ag, winter, enough, farmer's, living, market, costs \n \t Lift: -or, +, 1, 1,000, 10, ability, activities \n \t Score: winter, costs, ag, among, evidence-based, feeding, market \nTopic 3 Top Words:\n \t Highest Prob: food, locally, like, local, see, healthy, can \n \t FREX: grown, produced, locally, economically, food, healthy, year \n \t Lift: cans, grown, resource, allowing, attend, average, barriers \n \t Score: locally, grown, poor, produced, food, can, resource \nTopic 4 Top Words:\n \t Highest Prob: food, see, school, like, land, local, sustainable \n \t FREX: focus, also, space, school, development, help, preserve \n \t Lift: $, 5-, abundant, alleviate, allowed, along, also \n \t Score: csa, lose, pandemic, space, livestock, ranchers, urban \nTopic 5 Top Words:\n \t Highest Prob: local, foods, produce, stores, farmers, markets, community \n \t FREX: afford, restaurants, away, buying, composting, even, many \n \t Lift: #11, adults, alone, appealing, applaud, apple, apples \n \t Score: composting, produce, afford, really, buying, shares, balance \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA few things to note:\n\n* It looks like the `stm()` function automatically drops empty documents.

The boost in farmer’s market coupons and extra produce with wic during summer is amazing but in the winter it’s just back to way too much cereal and grains which isn’t okay. One of our biggest issues in the winter is finding funds for a variety of fresh foods since everything becomes so much more expensive. I’m not vying for pineapples in January or anything but maybe an indoor farmer’s market to get greens and greenhouse crops from local farmers. That could extend the farmer’s season and provide more fresh options to missoulians that haven’t traveled 1,000+ miles \n Topic 3: \n \t I’d like to see I ncreased opportunities for preservation of irrigable lands and increased local food options (although Neva and other folks have done a good job trying). Water is a limited resource, so preservation of that resource (and valuable soils) will largely be what determines our food security into the future. \n Topic 4: \n \t The urban sprawl and development of prime farm land is a big deal. Once a subdivision is built, there is no going back.  It would also be nice if urban farms could legally raise livestock including more than 6 chickens, pigs, cows and goats. Urban farms would be more effficient systems if they were allowed to integrate livestock into their farming systems. For example, grazing animals to keep grass and weeds down, pigs to feed farm/food waste too, and all of the manure to compost and use for fertilizer. \n Topic 5: \n \t More community garden plots in underserved areas with regular on site support to teach families (or even just kids)  to plant, grow and harvest.  Sometimes kids want a better life than their parents are willing or able to provide.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYes! That seems to have resolved the problem. Now I'll use the second DFM to build a STM.\n\n## Structured Topic Model\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# specify number of topics\nk <- 5\n\n# specify model\nstm_change <-

There are some statistically significant associations between some of the ZIP Codes and particular topics. However, given that I am still exploring how to preprocess my corpus into a DFM and the appropriate number of topics, I am not considering this analysis to be final. Ultimately, the sample is such (too small, not distributed over income brackets and ZIP Codes--some of the ZIP Codes have one respondent!) that it will preclude me from drawing any firm conclusions about associations anyway.\n\n## Challenges and Questions Moving Forward\n\nOne challenge with topic modeling is that it is up to the researcher to decide how many topics (*k*) to include in the model. I have no sense of how to do this. Given that the corpus I am working with right now is only a few hundred short documents, I could count them manually but that will not always be feasible. It seems that the best practice is to build models with several different values for *k* and use various methods to evaluate those models.\n\nIn addition to thinking about how to tweak my DFM to make the results of my analysis more revealing, I also need to learn how to evaluate my models to determine which is the most appropriate. Related to that, I need to figure out how to visualize my results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
