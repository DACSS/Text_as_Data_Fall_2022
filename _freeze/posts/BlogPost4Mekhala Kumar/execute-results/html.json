This consisted of 48 terms which I plotted.\\\nUnsurprisingly, this shows that most of the articles discuss India in the Olympics (as Indian newspaper articles were used). One major theme that can be observed is the discussion of the hockey team, the men's team had placed third in over four decades hence marking history and was led by the captain Manpreet Singh. Other significant terms include medals and medal colours perhaps pertaining to victories by other Indian athletes; which may be more clearly observed through a topic model. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndfm_refined <- dfm_trim(articles_dfm, min_termfreq = 15)\ndfm_refined <- dfm_trim(dfm_refined, min_docfreq = .25, docfreq_type = \"prop\")\n\nfcm<- fcm(dfm_refined)\ndim(fcm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 48 48\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_features <- names(topfeatures(fcm, 48))\nfcm_refined <- fcm_select(fcm, pattern = top_features, selection = \"keep\")\ndim(fcm_refined)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 48 48\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsize <- log(colSums(fcm_refined))\ntextplot_network(fcm_refined, vertex_size = size / max(size) * 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](BlogPost4Mekhala-Kumar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Topic Modelling\nI used the topicmodels package to run a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. \n\n##Preparatory steps\n\nTo run the model, the data had to be in the form of a document term matrix. First the document feature matrix was converted into a one-token-per-document-per-row table and then this table was converted into a document term matrix. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticles_tidy<-tidy(articles_dfm)\narticles_tidy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 201,774 × 3\n   document term     count\n   <chr>    <chr>    <dbl>\n 1 text1    solitary     1\n 2 text214  solitary     1\n 3 text245  solitary     1\n 4 text629  solitary     1\n 5 text639  solitary     1\n 6 text797  solitary     1\n 7 text1099 solitary     1\n 8 text1    two-day      1\n 9 text311  two-day      1\n10 text368  two-day      1\n# … with 201,764 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_dtm <- articles_tidy %>%\n  cast_dtm(document, term, count)\nnews_dtm\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 1157, terms: 22365)>>\nNon-/sparse entries: 201774/25674531\nSparsity           : 99%\nMaximal term length: 84\nWeighting          : term frequency (tf)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Word topic probabilities\n## 3 topics\nThere was not much valuable information being provided by keeping only three topics.\\\nThe first topic seemed to be about Neeraj Chopra winning the gold medal in javelin throw and PV Sindhu winning the bronze medal in badminton and the second topic seemed to focus on hockey.

Allocation topic model for 25 topics\nAt first I plotted the top 10 words for each topic, however I thought that having the top 20 words would give a better idea of the content covered. \n## 25 topics\nMany of the topics (2,5,8,12,18,20) focus on hockey. However, different aspects pertaining to the game are discussed.\\\nTopic 2 discusses the Prime Minister honouring the hockey players with the highest sports award of India- the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna. \\\nTopic 5 is a little unclear as it has information about marketing but also mentions the police.\\\nTopic 8 covers the details of the hockey games and mentions the other countries that took part in the semifinal and final mens' matches.\\\nTopic 12 can be considered as the reaction of the public to the game and content of tweets regarding the same.\\\nTopic 18 has a mix of the hockey team's achievements and PV Sindhu's (badminton player) achievement\nTopic 20 discusses how the government of the state of Odisha reacted to the win and stated it would continue to sponsor the women's and men's hockey teams.\\\n\nAll of the players mentioned in the topic models were either winners or in the final rounds of their respective sports. They also contained information regarding tweets and prominent celebrities that congratulated them. There was no noticeable difference in the top terms used for male sports players and female sports players.However, one difference that can be observed is that although both the mens' and womens' Indian hockey teams played well, majority of the topics were regarding the mens' achievements (2,8,12 and 18). Perhaps, because they placed third whereas the womens' team placed fourth.  \\\nSimilar to hockey, the sports of javelin throw, wrestling and weightlifting were mentioned in several topics. For the gold medallist Neeraj Chopra, there was also a topic which pertained to his army background. Finally, many of the topics about the winners mention cash prizes from sources such as the government and the term 'rs' which stands for rupees which is the Indian currency. \\\nThe topic that was popular outside the Indian context (topics 1 and 15), regarding the gymnast Simon Biles and the importance of mental health as she had withdrawn from the Olympics due to mental health concerns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_lda25 <- LDA(news_dtm, k = 25, control = list(seed = 2345))\nnews_lda25\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nA LDA_VEM topic model with 25 topics.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#extracting per-topic-per-word probabilities\nnews_topics25 <- tidy(news_lda25, matrix = \"beta\")\nnews_topics25\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 559,125 × 3\n   topic term          beta\n   <int> <chr>        <dbl>\n 1     1 solitary 3.47e- 25\n 2     2 solitary 5.65e-233\n 3     3 solitary 4.77e-232\n 4     4 solitary 4.00e-231\n 5     5 solitary 9.70e-232\n 6     6 solitary 2.56e-231\n 7     7 solitary 2.56e-233\n 8     8 solitary 2.46e-231\n 9     9 solitary 2.52e-  4\n10    10 solitary 8.94e- 34\n# … with 559,115 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Finding the top 10 terms\nnews_top_10_25 <- news_topics25 %>%\n  group_by(topic) %>%\n  slice_max(beta, n = 10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  arrange(topic, -beta)\n\nnews_top_10_25%>%\n  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_y_reordered()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](BlogPost4Mekhala-Kumar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Finding top 20 terms\nnews_top_20_25 <- news_topics25 %>%\n  group_by(topic) %>%\n  slice_max(beta, n = 20) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  arrange(topic, -beta)\n\nnews_top_20_25%>%\n  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(beta, term, fill = factor(topic))) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_y_reordered()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](BlogPost4Mekhala-Kumar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince many of the topic models had their top terms as \"olympics\" or \"India\", I wanted to check whether removing these terms would offer a deeper insight into the topics. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#removing some of the common words and then seeing how the topic model looks\narticles_dfm_common_rem <- dfm_remove(articles_dfm, c(\"olympics\",\"olympic\",\"india\",\"indian\",\"tokyo\",\"sports\",\"#tokyo2020\",\"2020\",\"2021\",\"india's\"), verbose = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nremoved 10 features\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narticles_tidy2<-tidy(articles_dfm_common_rem)\narticles_tidy2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 195,993 × 3\n   document term     count\n   <chr>    <chr>    <dbl>\n 1 text1    solitary     1\n 2 text214  solitary     1\n 3 text245  solitary     1\n 4 text629  solitary     1\n 5 text639  solitary     1\n 6 text797  solitary     1\n 7 text1099 solitary     1\n 8 text1    two-day      1\n 9 text311  two-day      1\n10 text368  two-day      1\n# … with 195,983 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_dtm2<- articles_tidy2 %>%\n  cast_dtm(document, term, count)\nnews_dtm2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 1157, terms: 22355)>>\nNon-/sparse entries: 195993/25668742\nSparsity           : 99%\nMaximal term length: 84\nWeighting          : term frequency (tf)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Topic Models with some common words removed\nMost of the topics regarding the prominent sports players remained the same. \\\nThis model did make it more clear as to why the word police occured in one of the topics that was about hockey.
