They hypothesized that activists’ group \nstatus – whether they are a member of the advantaged group or the \ndisadvantaged group – will influence the way activists are perceived in society.\nThey used qualitative coding to identify the presence of stereotypes that are\nused to describe the activists of each group. They found that activists from \ndisadvantaged groups are viewed as emotional and reactive, and activists from \nadvantaged groups are viewed as altruistic and superficial. \nIn my opinion, this was an interesting study, and I would like to examine the\nsocial media content of activists from both groups to see whether their content \nfits the stereotypes listed in this paper.\n\nA sentiment analysis of the Black Lives Matter movement using Twitter \n(Peng et al. 2022): This paper examined public reactions to the BLM movement. \nThe researchers used ‘sentiment analysis’ on the Twitter data to explore these \npublic reactions. Additionally, they used retweet frequency and word count \nfrequency to highlight important sentiments of people towards the BLM movement. \nThey found that the BLM movement was received positively as there were a great \nproportion of tweets supporting the movement. The negative sentiment was \nassociated with the deaths of black people.  \nIn my opinion, this was an interesting study understanding multiple \nsentiments revolving around the movement. I want to extend this study \nto measure the differences in the way a social message is received \ndependent on one’s group membership.\n\n##Specific Questions of Interest\n\n\tI want to study the tweets of both Black and White activists to highlight \n\tthe sentiments used to promote social change. I want to compare the emotions \n\tof the tweets of Black and White activists on a Black movement and measure\n\tthe conditions that lead to more retweets. Borrowing the stereotypes from \n\tBurrows et al. (2022) paper, I want to examine if the content of the social\n\tmedia messages of the activists are aligned with the stereotypes attached \n\tto their activist identity, and how this alignment or misalignment affects \n\tsocial change (which I would like to measure through retweets). \n\tI aim to scrape Twitter data and use techniques \n\t(sentiment analysis, word frequency, and retweet frequency) \n\tlike the Peng et al. (2022) paper.\nFor now, I am thinking of performing the following research steps:\n1.\tList the categories from Burrows et al (2022) used to describe activists.\n2.\tMap these categories to the content found in activists’ tweets.\n3.\tAdditionally, do sentiment analysis on the content of the tweets.\n4.\tMeasure word frequency of categories for Black and White activists’ tweets\n\n\n\n\n",
