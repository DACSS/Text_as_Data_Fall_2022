I've heard reddit is a bit frustrating, I decided to try twitter first. This included me downloading the R package \"rtweet\". Once I was able to use their API to create a project, I went ahead and tried to download multiple tweets.\n\n## Frustrations with APIs and R\n\nUnfortunately \"rtweet\" had a very similar issue to the package \"RedditextractorR\", both had a limit that made it difficult to work with. \"rtweet\" only allowed you to search from the last 6-9 days of tweets. This makes it hard to gather a lot of data over time. \"RedditextractorR\" only allowed you have comments from 7 posts at a time. It seems that using R for both types of packages proved to be very difficult.\n\nI also tried to use the package \"twitteR\" however it would not load properly for me. It kept giving me errors. Even with the properly set up Twitter API I was unable to have it connect to the account. This took over ***eight hours*** to try to get to work (including looking at multiple pages that suggested adding more packages to make both \"twitteR\" and \"rtweet\" to work) before I decide to give up on trying to using all of the packages.\n\n## Looking for a New Option\n\nI ended up deciding to look into other ways I could download tweets and Reddit posts. While most websites offered the same API options as mentioned before, a few of them recommended using Python instead.\n\nAfter awhile I ended up deciding to download Python and Visual Studio Code to run Python. I had little hope and had some frustrations with downloading the \"pip\" package but was able to download it.\n\n## Downloading Tweets and Reddit Posts through Python\n\nAfter finding a YouTube video I was able to use the python package \"[snscrape](https://github.com/mehranshakarami/AI_Spectrum/blob/main/2022/snscrape/tweets.py)\" that someone had created for python (you can watch the explanation of how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtIMnmbnOFo)!) in order to allow downloading tweets without having to us an API. This was extremely helpful as the whole time to download all of the tweets I was interested in (both #loveisblindjapan and \"love is blind japan\") were downloaded within a few minutes.\n\nFor the Reddit posts I used a [website](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-scrape-large-amounts-of-reddit-data-using-pushshift-1d33bde9286) that explained to me how to download all the comments that were on the subreddit r/loveisblindjapan. This also only took a few minutes.\n\nBetween Reddit and Twitter I was able to download over 20k comments from users who watched the TV show.\n\n## Editing the Data in Google Sheets\n\nSince I did this through python I ended up saving the data into a csv file. This allowed me to check out the data in better detail in Google Sheets. I did a few things in Google Sheets since it was easier:\n\n-   Combined the two twitter csv files (One for #loveisblindjapan and another for the phrase \"love is blind japan\") and removed any duplicates between them with the \"remove duplicate\" function.\n\n-   I noticed the reddit csv file had time categorized as \"utc\" which stands for coordinate universal time. This gave me numbers such as \"1643382213\" which is fairly unreadable to me. Thus I used this formula to fix it: =X2/86400+DATE(1970,1,1)+time(5,30,0). This allowed me to have 1/28/2022 20:33:33 which is easier to understand. However to match the twitter csv file (done in year/month/day (YMD)) I used removed the time from the end and formatted it using Google Sheet's \"custom date and time\" format to end up with 2022-01-28.\n\n-   Since the twitter csv file had YMD and then time I split the column so it only had YMD.\n\n-   I ended up merging the files together (This included a count of comments from people, the username of the person, and the actually tweet or post). I made an extra column that would say if it was from Twitter or Reddit.\n\n## Data Quality\n\nWhile almost all Reddit posts were made in English, I noticed there were quite a few tweets that were partially or completely in a different language. This has lead to me debating on if I should just remove the non English tweets entirely or leave them in.\n\nI also noticed there were more tweets that had spelling errors than on Reddit posts. This is likely due to being unable to edit tweets, however this may cause a problem. Additionally tweets were more likely to use slang than Reddit.\n\nFrom a quick glance I also noticed that tweets were often writing about how the show made them feel rather than about the contestants on the show. This may lead me to change my research question or decide to use only Reddit posts. Reddit posts seemed to focus on the contestants more often.\n\nFor the Reddit posts I also noticed that unfortunately the data does not seem to tell me how to now if people are replying to another comment on the post. Some of the posts will start with \"I know what you mean!\" This could lead to less examples of contestants names being shown, which could make my research question difficult.\n\n## Updated Research Question\n\n**Previously my research question was:** Do Reddit and Twitter differentiate on their views of contestants and their relationships in *Love is Blind Japan*?\n\n**My current research question I'm leaning towards is:** How do Reddit and Twitter users feel about the show *Love is Blind Japan*?\n\n**Why I'm considering the change:** It seems that although the contestants are important, if I want to focus on purely how viewers felt about the contestants I would need to only use Reddit posts. Additionally I will be analyzing the positive and negative sentiments of Reddit and Twitter together.\n\n## Bringing in the Data\n\nIn order to check the data I've added my csv file to my repository. I will first check that it was added correctly.\n\nI use the \"here\" package because it allows you to bypass the issue of setwd(), allowing you to change your working directory file. **A relative path to the project root directory will always be created using here().**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#corpus <- read.csv(here(\"posts\",\"loveisblind_socialmedia.csv\"))\ncorpus <- read.csv(here(\"posts\", \"_data\", \"loveisblind_socialmedia.csv\"))\nhead(corpus)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        date\n1 2022-09-23\n2 2022-09-23\n3 2022-09-22\n4 2022-09-22\n5 2022-09-22\n6 2022-09-22\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           text\n1                                                                                                                                                                                         #LoveIsBlindJapan is wayyy better than the US version\n2                                                                                     S01 | E05I've just watched episode Just the Two of Us of Love is Blind: Japan! #loveisblindjapan  https://t.co/lTQZT8XzdX #tvtime https://t.co/NZW6DkFR3O\n3                                                                                                                                                                Let’s be real, Kaoru just wanted to promote her music career #LoveIsBlindJapan\n4                                                                                                                                                        Why do I feel like a lot of these people just wanted a free holiday? #LoveIsBlindJapan\n5                                                                                                                                                                                Ayano and Shuntaro make me uncomfortable ngl #LoveIsBlindJapan\n6 I decided I need a palate cleanser from the US Love is Blind S2 before I watch S3, so I have been rewatching parts of Love is Blind Japan. \\nRyotaro and Motomi are still the most adorable people and couple. #LoveIsBlind #LoveIsBlindJapan\n  twitter_reddit\n1        twitter\n2        twitter\n3        twitter\n4        twitter\n5        twitter\n6        twitter\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we can see the data loaded in correctly and all three of the columns I wanted!\n\n## Attempting to Clean the Data (a bit)\n\nWhile the data is in the correct columns, I would still like to try a bit of cleaning to see if we can remove some items. The first thing I will do is remove non english from all of my posts. This is due to me being unable to analyze other languages correctly.\n\n### Remove Languages\n\nThe first thing I thought of was removing Japanese as the show was in Japan, so I found this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60181121/how-do-i-remove-japanese-characters).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_rm_jap = function(x) {\n  #we replace japanese blocks with nothing, and clean any double whitespace from this\n  #reference at http://www.rikai.com/library/kanjitables/kanji_codes.unicode.shtml\n  x %>% \n    #japanese style punctuation\n    str_replace_all(\"[\\u3000-\\u303F]\", \"\") %>% \n    #katakana\n    str_replace_all(\"[\\u30A0-\\u30FF]\", \"\") %>% \n    #hiragana\n    str_replace_all(\"[\\u3040-\\u309F]\", \"\") %>% \n    #kanji\n    str_replace_all(\"[\\u4E00-\\u9FAF]\", \"\") %>% \n    #remove excess whitespace\n    str_replace_all(\"  +\", \" \") %>% \n    str_trim()\n}\n\ncorpus_posts <- corpus$text %>% str_rm_jap\n```\n:::\n\n\nHowever I realized there were many more languages. This made it a bit more difficult. So I decided to keep looking and found this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49338549/remove-languages-other-than-english-from-corpus-or-data-frame-in-r).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"cld3\")\ncorpus2 <- subset(corpus, detect_language(corpus$text) == \"en\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis seemed to work well! It may not be the perfect solution but it seems to have removed any tweets or posts that were not in English.\n\n### Check Package TextClean\n\nThe next package I'll use for that is \"textclean\".\n\nI'll first check any posts or tweets (henceforth known as posts) using the check_text() function.\n\nThis takes quite awhile (I didn't actually time it but I had enough time to watch a ton of Youtube clips!)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncheck_text(corpus2$text)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\n===========\nCONTRACTION\n===========\n\nThe following observations contain contractions:\n\n1, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 27, 33, 35...[truncated]...\n\nThis issue affected the following text:\n\n1: S01 | E05I've just watched episode Just the Two of Us of Love is Blind: Japan! #loveisblindjapan  https://t.co/lTQZT8XzdX #tvtime https://t.co/NZW6DkFR3O\n...[truncated]...\n9: This probably seems so silly but I'm annoyed that none of the #LoveIsBlindJapan cast members have verified Instagram accounts while Netflix will make sure to get every single American reality show cast member a verified Instagram account.\n...[truncated]...\n12: S01 | E02I've just watched episode Nice to Meet You, My Beloved of Love is Blind: Japan! #loveisblindjapan  https://t.co/ls7SHX5c4u #tvtime https://t.co/m2n3p8O0xt\n...[truncated]...\n14: I'm crying laughing, crying and laughing again so cute #LoveIsBlindJapan\n...[truncated]...\n16: My favourite thing about Midori and Wataru's relationship is they reassure each other.

An article I found about his sentencing said that she was his mistress and he said at his trial that he still cared about his mistress after his wife pledged to support him with getting treatment for his drug addiction, and the mistress said he slipped her the drugs. I can’t speak to the Japanese public’s reactions to drug use, but I can I understand why Kaoru was so hurt and traumatized by all this and still estranged from him. He completely betrayed their family in such a public and shameful way.\n\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/12/national/crime-legal/pop-star-aska-gets-suspended-sentence-drug-use/\n...[truncated]...\n8357: https://dnbstories.com/2017/12/10-meanest-countries-on-social-media.html\n\nMic drop.\n...[truncated]...\n11114: According to participants, there is a heavy amount of interference and editing in their storylines.

The way Minami says things so bluntly is very unusual in Japan - at least straight off the bat towards someone you’ve known for less than a year. So when Mori said that it might be an issue, like after the second meeting or so, that was warning #1 lol also the hair thing was bad. In Japanese, you would go: \n\nwoman: points at hair\\*, (you seem to be shedding a lot), are you ok? \n\nMori: ah, sorry. It’s a new medical thing I’m trying at the moment, you see.\n\nwoman: ah, I see. Seems difficult. Clean up must be hard, huh?\n\nmori: ah, yes it is. \n\nwoman: ganbatte ne\n\nmori: hai, ganbarimasu\n\nfrom this convo, someone typically less direct would bring up the issue very subtly, then sympathize then tell the person to do their best and get their shit together. Hence why things keep being repeated in conversations. I think Mori felt bad for Minami when she mention how she dated Mori to change herself for the positive. However, Mori messed up when he mentions his dreams for the third time and then Minami gives her reasoning for wanting to keep her career. They were not wrong for having their dreams, but that fact that it was personal for them both and neither of them would change their dream it further proved that they wouldn’t work between them.   \n\n\nI think Kaori and Periya is another good example. For Kaori, the whole thing about her father and her having to point out to Misaki that he didn’t even ask her how she felt about her whole situation felt heartless to her. The fact that she had to explain this was already too much in Kaori mind.  When you say super sad shit in Japanese, typically you respond with “Tai hen sou” (that sounds hard/difficult to deal with) or “kibishi sou desu ne” (that sounds difficult/harsh) and then ask the person if they are ok “daijoubu” the thing with Periya and Mizuki is that when dating in Japan, you are asking your age, family and job occupation is fairly normal. The fact that Periya had to dig and dig for answer from him was flag #1. The other flags kept appearing when he fluffed that he was an owner of a restaurant when he clearly was not. His dreams did not make sense and he felt like he was trying to be someone he was not. For her, she felt like her time was wasted or false because Mizuki was not really present during LIB.  \n\n\nFor Periya, Mizuki felt shady vibes in the sense that his occupation was a lie. He ordered the most expensive bottle on the menu and seemed to live beyond his means (based on Periya’s observations). Now that with his dream retirement to be in another country with no idea on how to continue said business, provide for his family and be idk on his citizenship status in another country marked all the red flags in my books. Mizuki was nice, but there wasn’t an warmth in his voice lol you can easily sense tones and emotions in Japanese as things are meant to be pointed at times and you have to read between the lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nexperience: MA on Japan, 7 formal years of learning Japanese lol\n...[truncated]...\n8666: \n\n\\* Panru = Lupin (sometimes to be cutesy, you reverse syllabic order of words/names, so Rupan/Lupin = Panru...)\n\nOkay this is fascinating, thank you for including this in your translation!\n...[truncated]...\n9341: ;\\_\\_\\_;\n\nthis made the week for me.

I'm unsure why, (as I believe it happened removing other languages) so I'll have to remove it later.\n\n    -   Although it has been very helpful it seems to be unable to clean up everything. That's alright but a bit confusing as to why.\n\n-   I noticed that some posts are now \"NA\" I'd like to remove those from my database by the next blog post.\n\n-   I would also like to change all text to lower case.\n\n-   I may want to use the \"tm\" package to clean up my data even more. Currently I feel like a lot of the harder things have been taken out.\n\n-   I'm a bit confused on the creating the corpus as token with the \"textshape\" package. It seems to work but I'm unsure of how it's working.\n\n## Looking Ahead at Tutorial 5\n\nAfter taking a brief look at tutorial 5 there does seem to be some very useful tips in there. Here is currently what I have. I may be able to combine some of what I was looking at and what lesson 5 has together!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(devtools)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'devtools' was built under R version 4.1.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: usethis\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'usethis' was built under R version 4.1.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidytext)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'tidytext' was built under R version 4.1.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(plyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'plyr' was built under R version 4.1.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nYou have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems.\nIf you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr:\nlibrary(plyr);
