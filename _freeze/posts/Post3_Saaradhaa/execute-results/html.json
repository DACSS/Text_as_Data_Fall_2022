So far, I have been struggling with this quite a bit. This post will specifically focus on cleaning the PDFs, pre-processing them in R, then trying out different descriptives.\n\n## Manual Cleaning\n\n-   To recap, I downloaded 50 PDFs of oral histories. I generated word clouds in Blog Post 2 to get some sense of how I need to clean them. I also skimmed through the PDFs to understand the content better.\n\n-   I deleted PDFs 42-50 (representing students of fine arts teachers). Methodologically, it doesn't make sense to include this group. When I skimmed through the transcripts, the actual age range of students varies, so they don't neatly represent young people. Further, for those who are actually young, they represent young people who are more attached to their cultural roots anyway, and might be fundamentally different from the young people who comment on Reddit.\n\n-   This leaves me with 41 transcripts. However, I had a lot of trouble figuring out a standardised way to clean all of them, as the oral histories were collected over a number of years by different researchers - hence, not all the PDFs had a consistent format.\n\n-   For transcripts 1 to 34, I initially wanted to convert them to HTML to remove **bold** text, which represents most of what needs to be removed. I was unable to use R packages (poppler, pdftohtml, pdf2html) to convert them to HTML and do this, since these packages only work on older versions of R.\n\n-   So unfortunately, I had to do some steps manually:\n\n    -   Using Actions in Adobe Acrobat, I converted PDF to HTML to get rid of the running header and footer, then converted to plain text.\n\n    -   I manually removed the header for transcripts 12, 14, 21 and 22, and 'narrator', 'date', 'interviewed by', 'place' and 'end of interview' for all.\n\n    -   I manually removed the post-script for transcript 28 - it's a post-interview message from the interviewee, which does not represent meaningful oral history data.\n\n    -   I manually removed the header, index and glossary for transcripts 35 to 41.\n\n## Processing in R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# list out files.\nfile_list <- dir(\"~/Desktop/2022_Fall/GitHub/Text_as_Data_Fall_2022/posts/Transcripts\", full.names = TRUE, pattern = \"*.txt\")\n\n# create list of text files.\ntranscripts <- readtext(paste0(file_list), docvarnames = c(\"transcript\", \"text\"))\n\n# remove references to 'interviewer:' and 'interviewee:', as well as line breaks, '\\n'.

I may need to use Python for this.\n\n-   Use str_match() compare how many times \"culture\" appears in the oral histories vs. Reddit data, and do a statistical test.\n\n-   Try out CleanNLP (Week 4 Tutorial).\n",
