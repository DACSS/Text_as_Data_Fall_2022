This project is merely exploratory for me. It may develop closer to the end of the project.\n:::\n\n\nCreating avatars in games gives people the freedom to be creative and cultivate an alternate identity. Now, this identity can be their \"ideal self\" or something that they just create for fun. To understand this process of creating identities I want to first examine the avatars people have already made. For this context I am thinking of scouring Reddit to find threads that talk about people describing the avatars/characters they have created while playing \"Dungeons and Dragons\". \n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n\n## Data Collection  \n\nI was able to scrap data from multiple Reddit threads where users talk about their characters that they have created while playing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"rvest\")\n# install.packages(\"RedditExtractoR\")\n# install.packages(\"textclean\")\nlibrary(RedditExtractoR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'RedditExtractoR' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rvest)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter()         masks stats::filter()\n✖ readr::guess_encoding() masks rvest::guess_encoding()\n✖ dplyr::lag()            masks stats::lag()\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(quanteda)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPackage version: 3.2.3\nUnicode version: 13.0\nICU version: 69.1\nParallel computing: 8 of 8 threads used.\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(quanteda.textplots)\nlibrary(textclean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'textclean' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nurl <- c(\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/b1pk5c/tell_me_about_your_characters/\", \n         \"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/33bv4f/best_dd_character_youve_made_or_seen/\",\n         \"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/37cx49/your_first_ever_dd_character/\",\n         \"https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2fk4op/best_dd_character_youve_ever_made/\",\n         \"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/cgdwgl/share_your_dnd_character/\",\n         \"https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/au8k0w/what_are_some_of_your_favourite_dd_character/\")\n\n#comments <- get_thread_content(url)\n#save.image(\"mantek_blogpost4.RData\")\nload(\"mantek_blogpost4.RData\")\n\n#preprocessing\nall_comments <- \n  comments$comments$comment %>% \n  str_replace_all(\"\\n\",\" \")           #data cleaning\n\nall_comments <- replace_contraction(all_comments)     #opened all contractions, like didn't to did not\n\ntail(all_comments, n = 10)    #Some of the comments\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"After watching a tierzoo video about companion races in nature, I want to play a Grung beastmaster.

He once outswam a bull shark to save a friend and is therefore styled after a matador. He has horrible rolls in combat.   Other notable characters include:  Lim: a half elf evocation wizard from a well respected family of high elf divination wizards. Her elf mother cheated on her father and died in childbirth, and her father was too focused on his studies to notice or care. She has an heirloom set of her grandmother's bones that she can not actually use to divine anything. Nonetheless she pretends (I normally roll all of my dice and make generalizations from their total).   Riis: the \\\"human male farmer\\\" who is actually a half elf female rogue in disguise. She is a pathological liar and deeply committed this alter ego, even when the facts do not line up. I played her in a bronze age campaign, which happened to end with the assassination of their heir to the Persian Empire. Shortly after, Cyrus the Great ascended and Riis slipped out of spotlight. Coincidence?   Ksssht: my first ever character was an owlbear. Her cubs were taken and sold into slavery, so she came out of the forest to find them and left absolute destruction wherever she went. The party also included a deranged warlock, so the paladin spent a lot of time apologizing to/buying off local business owners .  \"\n [4] \"I\\031ve got 1 more!  - Bronze Dragon, Red dragon sorc 14/Fiendlock 3/Champion 3, Haunted one \\024 Bronze Dragonborn kicked out of clan after Tiamat makes him a warlock and draws out his red dragon blood.

She has a tragic background.   She was originally from the coast tribe, and therefore knows misty step, water walking, and water breathing. But because she was extraordinarily pretty as a human, her tribe sold her into slavery when she was 8. She escaped, and now is a mercenary chaoitic neutral. She is incredibly independent, and does not trust anyone and is just trying to survive.   Because of her relationship with the coast tribe, she hates water and has taken an interest in fire spells. She hates being touched or pet, is extremely self-conscious about her human form, and goes to great lengths to make sure nobody sees her human form.  She is adept in defensive water and fire magic.

It is a philosophy of altruistic individualism. This philosophy holds that people should behave altruistically and that society exists for the sake of its individual members.  \n\n**Lawful good** is the philosophy that goodness is best achieved through law and order. It is a philosophy of altruistic collectivism. This philosophy holds that people should behave altruistically and put the needs of the group ahead of individual desires.\n\n**Neutral good** is the philosophy that goodness should be advanced by using whatever means provide the most benefit. It is a philosophy of altruistic consequentialism. This philosophy holds that people should behave altruistically and balance the needs of the collective as a whole and the needs of the individuals making up the collective.  \n:::\n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDnD_dfm_char <- dfm_remove(DnD_dfm1, c(\"good\", \"fight\", \"chaotic\", \"kind\", \"campaign\", \"war\", \"killed\", \"story\", \"death\", \"old\", \"friend\", \n                                       \"city\",\"full\", \"man\", \"knowledge\", \"gold\", \"game\", \"played\", \"level\", \"high\", \"neutral\", \"hand\", \n                                       \"town\", \"order\", \"often\", \"player\", \"hit\",  \"battle\", \"player\", \"damage\", \"lawful\", \"idea\", \"years\",\n                                       \"shield\", \"powerful\", \"evil\", \"bad\", \"strength\", \"work\", \"kill\", \"giant\", \"wanted\", \"mind\",                                                \"village\",\"save\", \"end\", \"point\", \"combat\", \"dm\", \"favorite\", \"died\", \"magical\", \"class\", \"orc\", \n                                       \"cast\", \"half\", \"spell\", \"family\", \"brother\", \"father\", \"race\", \"young\", \"halfling\"))\n\nDnD_dfm_char\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDocument-feature matrix of: 375 documents, 24 features (91.84% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    dragonborn barbarian paladin dragon sorcerer spells human rogue magic\n  text1          1         1       1      1        1      1     0     0     0\n  text2          1         0       0      1        0      0     0     0     0\n  text3          0         0       0      0        0      0     1     2     1\n  text4          1         0       0      1        0      0     0     0     0\n  text5          0         0       0      0        0      0     0     0     0\n  text6          1         0       0      0        0      0     0     0     0\n       features\ndocs    warlock\n  text1       0\n  text2       0\n  text3       0\n  text4       1\n  text5       0\n  text6       0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 369 more documents, reached max_nfeat ... 14 more features ]\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntopfeatures(DnD_dfm_char, 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     magic      human    fighter      rogue     wizard        elf       bard \n        77         70         67         64         64         58         57 \n    ranger    paladin     dragon     spells     cleric        god    warlock \n        56         54         50         48         48         43         38 \n     power      dwarf  barbarian   sorcerer    friends      druid     master \n        38         37         29         29         28         27         26 \ndragonborn      rurik       mage \n        25         24         21 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntextplot_wordcloud(DnD_dfm_char)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MantekBhatia_BlogPost_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#creating a Network plot\nDnD_fcm = fcm(DnD_dfm_char)\n\n# pull the top features\nmyFeatures = names(topfeatures(DnD_fcm, 20))\n\n# retain only those top features as part of our matrix\nSmaller_fsm = fcm_select(DnD_fcm, pattern = myFeatures, selection = \"keep\")\n\n# compute size weight for vertices in network\nsize = log(colSums(Smaller_fsm))\n\n# create plot\ntextplot_network(Smaller_fsm, vertex_size = size / max(size) * 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MantekBhatia_BlogPost_4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note   \n\nHere, you can read more about the different classes of characters you see in the word cloud and network plot.  \n\n[Different Character Classes of D&D characters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes)  \n:::\n\n",
