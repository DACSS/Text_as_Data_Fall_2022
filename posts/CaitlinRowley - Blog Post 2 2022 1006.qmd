I will be using the June 24, 2022 Supreme Court decision "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization" for my research project. Though I still need to do some refining, my research questions will focus on the rationale behind both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinion. Specifically, I would like to apply a co-occurrence matrix using terms such as ''Roe', 'Wade', 'v.', 'state', 'federal', 'reproductive', 'rights', 'women', 'women\`s', and 'female'.

```{r}
# read in data:

Dobbs <- pdf_text("C:\\Users\\caitr\\OneDrive\\Documents\\DACSS\\DACSS 679\\DACSS 697\\Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.pdf")

# test data by pulling content from a particular page:

test <- Dobbs[50]
```

```{r}
# view entire decision: 

print(Dobbs)
length(sentences)

```

\# This opinion is 213 pages long. There are 720 sentences. I would like to create eight separate character vectors: (1) syllabus, (2) majority opinion, (3) appendices to majority opinion, (4) concurring opinion (Thomas), (5) concurring appendix (Kavanaugh), concurring in judgment (Roberts), (7) dissenting opinion, and (8) appendix to dissenting opinion.

```{r}
# detect all pages that contain the word "syllabus":

str_detect(Dobbs, "syllabus")
```

\# This function is showing that the word "syllabus" only appears on the first page of the text. I know this is not true, so I will work more on that line of code so that I can identify each vector.

```{r}
# try to detect "majority opinion"

str_detect(Dobbs, "majority opinion")
```

\# I received a similar result from this code. It is my assumption that this code is not pulling text from the entire page, but rather from the body of the text. I am trying to pull text from the headers of each page so as to separate the text into vectors. I will do more research on this topic for future blog posts.

\# In the meantime, I will try to pull references to particular indicators that I have identified.

```{r}
# find references to "Roe v. Wade"

str_match(Dobbs, "Roe v. Wade | Roe | Wade")
```

\# From this code, we can see on which pages there were references to Roe v. Wade. However, I do know that both Roe and Wade are mentioned in the first page, so I would like to figure out why this is not appearing in my results.

\# Next steps: work on pre-processing and generating co-occurrence matrices. I would also like to play around with data visualization.
