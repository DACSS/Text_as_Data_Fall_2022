## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

```{r}
# install packages

install.packages("cleanNLP")
install.packages("tidytext")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("quanteda")
install.packages("pdftools")
install.packages("wordcloud")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("slam")
install.packages("NLP")

# load libraries

library(cleanNLP)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)
library(quanteda.textplots)
library(XML)
library(wordcloud)
library(tm)
library(slam)
library(NLP)

# initialize the NLP backend

cnlp_init_udpipe(
  model_name = NULL, 
  model_path = NULL, 
  tokenizer = "tokenizer",
  tagger = "default",
  parser = "default")
```

\# I am seeking some guidance regarding my character vectors, but in the interim, I will do some pre-processing, generate co-occurence matrices, and try some data visualization. First, I will work on transforming all letters to lowercase, removing punctuation, and removing stop words. I do not want to remove numbers, because I anticipate years being an important component of this text.

```{r}
Dobbs_token <- tokens(Dobbs, "word", remove_symbols = FALSE, remove_numbers = FALSE, remove_url = FALSE, remove_separators = TRUE, split_hyphens = FALSE, include_docvars = TRUE, padding = FALSE, verbose = quanteda_options("verbose"))
  tokens_tolower(Dobbs_token)
  remove_punct = T
  tokens_select(Dobbs_token, pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove")
```

\# I am not yet convinced that I will need to do any stemming or lemmatization, as I will be focusing primarily on nouns, but I will reconsider this as I move forward. I will next try some data visualization:

```{r}
wordcloud(Dodds, min_count = 5, max_words = 50, random_order = FALSE)
```

\# I keep receiving the following errors: 'loading required package: RColorBrewer' and 'loading required namespace: tm'. It is my understanding that textplot_wordcloud only works on dfm. So, I will need to conduct some additional research on forms of data visualization for text files if 'wordcloud' continues to not work.
