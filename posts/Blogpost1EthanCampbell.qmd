## Two academic articles


[Articles one](https://www.academia.edu/43832470/An_Assessment_of_Performance_and_Efficiency_of_Team_Based_Organisations_Empirical_Evidence_of_English_Premier_League_EPL_using_Data_Envelopment_Analysis_DEA_and_Naturalistic_Approach_NA_2005_to_2016)

Study on performance efficiency of team-based organisations

[Article two](https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=at)

Study to determine which factors seperate the best premier league teams from the rest

## Focual Points

### What are the research questions?

> **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**

  * "Which EPL club(s) could be regarded as the most efficient using the research methodology?" (Badmus, 2019).
 
  * "To what extent does EPL ranking evaluate efficient performance and what factorsresponsible for such outcomes" (Badmus, 2019).
  * "Could it be argued that the existing methodologies in ranking EPL football clubs need modifications to align with the recent transformation in managerial focus within football industry" (Badmus, 2019).
 
  * "How does the social value of football clubs’ impact on the stakeholders’ assessments of clubs’ performance and efficiency" (Badmus, 2019).
 
  * "How can the current method of assessing teams’ performance be improved" (Badmus, 2019).

> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**
 
  * "What differentiates a top-notch team from an also ran" Joel Oberstone (2009).
 
  * "Are there specific offensive and defensive pitch actions that are more influential than others in a team’s achievement over the season" Joel Oberstone (2009).
 
### What data is used?

> **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**

  * Panel data on EPL over twelve seasons between 2005-2016 which was obtained from the official Barclays Premier league site.
    * One part to note is that since there is a relegation and promotion system it yielded an unbalanced panel dataset.
  * Utilized survey techniques in the form of questionnaires and mini-interviews which presented qualitative data. Quantitative data was also incorporated from the season data.
 
> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**

  * Data was drawn from Opta Sportsdata for the complete 2007-2008 Season.
 
### How is the data collected

>  **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**
 
  * Season and player data has been collected directly from the Barclay website
 
  * "The secondary data were sourced from published Annual Financial Report of English PremierFootball Clubs, Articles in journals, Textbooks and other publications from newspaper,television and internet (Orbits and Econlits databases)" (Badmus, 2019).
 
> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**

  * Data was collected by Opta Sportsdata which was collected by attending every match and using data collection software.
 
### Hypothesis

>  **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**

  * "Thesis is aimed at assessing the performance and efficiency of the English Premier League" (Badmus, 2019).
 
  * The way I am assuming this hypothesis is that the higher ranked the team the better the performance and efficiency.
 
  * Identify which clubs could be regarded as the most efficient

> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**

  * The expected outcome is that the top teams will be more efficient with their resources.
 
  * There should be a way to categorize each team into certain bins of performance based on the data which will correlate to the success of the team.
 
### What methods are used  

> **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**

  * "Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is combined with Naturalistic Approach (NA) using NVivo text analyses from data obtained through semi-structured questionnaire and mini-interview for football stakeholders to assess the performance and efficiency of EPL football clubs for 12 seasons" (Badmus, 2019).

> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**

  * "A robust, statistically significant, six independent variable multiple regression model that accounts for the relative success of English Premier League football clubs based on an array of twenty-four pitch actions collected during the 2007-2008" Joel Oberstone (2009).
 
  * One-way ANOVA for specific field actions that will separate the clubs into different categories.

### What are the findings of the study

> **An Assessment of Performance and Efficiency of Team-Based Organisations**

  * To create a successful team there are many factors that will be required. I will name a few of them below but without these factors the efficiency and wealth of a team may be wasted. "Conclusively, this study revealed that many English football clubs achieved pure technical efficiency during the period researched, displaying similar managerial skills. Meanwhile, scale effects differentiate the football clubs, some clubs displayed scale efficiencies and others could not. Hence, the scale is the main issue in football management. Thus, it could be concluded that the competitive imbalance among EPL clubs is a result of different scales of operation." (Badmus, 2019).
 
    * Managerial Skills
   
    * Experience
   
    * Tactics

> **Differentiating the Top English Premier League Football Clubs**

Here we are able to analyze some outcomes from this research and we are able to determine that the top 4 teams tended to perform on a higher level. They were more efficient on the field and we can see the trend of having a higher pass completion percentage tends to lead to more points. Statistically, the top four teams performed on a higher level with an all around higher average. There were certain teams that performed better than the top four teams in certain categories but unfortunately that was not enough to bridge the gap on the other aspects.

### My thoughts

These research articles were two interesting takes on the English Premier League which have inspired me to think more analytically about the league. Utilizing the quantitative and qualitative data to draw out information pertaining to which team is the most efficient is an interesting idea. I love being able to see the visual representation of the data which allows us to quickly draw conclusions from. For example, the image above show the pass completion percentage in relation to points earned within a season. We are able to see a nice trend of higher pass completion typically relates to more points in a season. These studies also conducted sound statistical analysis to draw forth conclusions regarding this data. One interesting point that was noticed is that the more efficient team is not always the one winning the match nor finishing higher in the league which leaves more variables to be examined. This will lead into my research question and my study which will touch base on the mental state of players from each team as the season progresses.

## Research questions and potential data sources

### Research questions

Analyzing how speech alters during the season based on their performance. I want to analyze if the top four teams speak differently or focus on certain words more than the other teams in the league. I believe this will give us a new insight into the league and mental effects the wins and losses have on each team. I would like to do this study around the year 2007-2008 since this was the most dominant EPL season we have ever seen with some of the best teams we have ever seen. There should also be an abundance of information since the season was such a strong one and since it has been dated a few years.


### Potential data sources

Transcripts from interviews for each match during the season from each team. If the data is not downloadable then I may set up a web scraper to pull each paragraph into an excel file before importing it into R.

## Documented questions

### Technical


  * How will I set up the web scraper? in R or Python or use the reticulate package to use both?
 
  * What form of statistical analysis would I like to perform?
 
  * How will you set up your corpus, documents, and features within this study?


### Formatting

  * How will I want to separate data?
 
  * The progression order as of now, locate data, obtain the data(web scraped if needed), clean the data, import the data, set up corpus/document/features, break the data down(counting function, separate into bins), begin to analyze data, visualize data, report.

### Other questions
