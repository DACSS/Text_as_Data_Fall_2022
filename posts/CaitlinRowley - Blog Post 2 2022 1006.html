<p>I will be using the June 24, 2022 Supreme Court decision “Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization” for my research project. Though I still need to do some refining, my research questions will focus on the rationale behind both the majority opinion and the dissenting opinion. Specifically, I would like to apply a co-occurrence matrix using terms such as ‘’Roe’, ‘Wade’, ‘v.’, ‘state’, ‘federal’, ‘reproductive’, ‘rights’, ‘women’, ‘women`s’, and ‘female’.</p>

Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health\n Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the\n Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s prec-\n edents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe\n v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.\n v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833. The District Court granted summary judg-\n ment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement\n of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion\n violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viabil-\n ity. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend\n the Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and\n that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review.\nHeld: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey\n are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the\n people and their elected representatives. Pp. 8–79.\n    (a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly un-\n derstood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Casey’s controlling\n opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the\n basis of stare decisis. A proper application of stare decisis, however,\n requires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  [2] "2      DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey\n    plurality did not consider. Pp. 8–32.\n         (1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court’s cases\n    have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s refer-\n    ence to “liberty” protects a particular right. The Constitution makes\n    no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con-\n    stitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an im-\n    plicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\n    right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\n    Fourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152–153. The Casey Court\n    grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an\n    abortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amend-\n    ment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can\n    be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but\n    that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s precedents, which es-\n    tablish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi-\n    cation and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies\n    to such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496,\n    n. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273–\n    274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by\n    the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.\n    Pp. 9–11.\n         (2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abor-\n    tion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an\n    essential component of “ordered liberty.” The Court finds that the\n    right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradi-\n    tion. The underlying theory on which Casey rested—that the Four-\n    teenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well\n    as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial.\n       The Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro-\n    tects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by\n    the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights\n    deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Consti-\n    tution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories,\n    the question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and\n    tradition” and whether it is essential to this Nation’s “scheme of or-\n    dered liberty.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation\n    marks omitted). The term “liberty” alone provides little guidance.\n    Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to\n    recognize a new component of the “liberty” interest protected by the\n    Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the\n    Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse\n    what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent\n    views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason,\n"

Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125.\n   Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo-\nnents of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the\nFourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor-\ntion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state\nconstitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years\nbefore Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor\nhad any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in\nevery single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least\nsome stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could\nhave very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed\nthe common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex-\npanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth\nAmendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor-\ntion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until\nthe day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history,\nand Casey declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis.\n   Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the\nface of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an\nasserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is never-\ntheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor Gen-\neral repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly\nestablished as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc-\ntion of a quick fetus,” 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au-\nthorities—Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone—all wrote that a post-\nquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities as-\nserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful” and that,\nas a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from\nthe attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an\nabortion right because of the common law’s failure to criminalize abor-\ntion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni-\nversal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83\nN. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late\n18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abor-\ntions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the author-\nity to do so.\n   Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right\nitself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the\nabortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe\ntermed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described\nit as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are\n“central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered\n"                                                                                                                                                          
  [4] "4      DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing inter-\n    ests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the in-\n    terests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what\n    they termed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S.,\n    at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those inter-\n    ests differently. The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered lib-\n    erty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from decid-\n    ing how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11–30.\n         (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor-\n    tion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other\n    precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot\n    be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abor-\n    tion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s\n    “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those\n    criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights\n    to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distin-\n    guishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on\n    which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions\n    acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe\n    termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls\n    an “unborn human being.” None of the other decisions cited by Roe\n    and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Ac-\n    cordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion,\n    and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such\n    a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30–32.\n       (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued ac-\n    ceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and\n    protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a\n    past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled prece-\n    dents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.”\n    Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It “contrib-\n    utes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”\n    Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris\n    by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important\n    questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command,\n    Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when\n    [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S.\n    203, 235. Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions\n    have overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Educa-\n    tion, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v.\n    Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny).\n       The Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered\n    in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v.

Like the infamous decision in\nPlessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision\ncourse with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey per-\npetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to\nresolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a win-\nning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the\nState’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their\nelected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views.\nThe Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the\nlarge number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45.\n      (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the\nconstitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire\ncountry a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters\nmuch like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation.\nSee 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming\nconsensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said\nabout the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying his-\ntory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-\nfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did\nnot explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the mean-\ning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases,\nthe Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.”\nId., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from dis-\nclosure and the right to make and implement important personal de-\ncisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429\nU. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinc-\ntive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.”\nWhen the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on\nthe country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among\nother things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved”\nand “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe,\n410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that\nlegislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that\naccommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked\nlike legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that\nmight be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring defi-\nciency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary\nviability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found\nmuch support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted\nto justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such\n"

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily de-\n    pendent on factors—such as medical advances and the availability of\n    quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics\n    of a fetus.\n       When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s\n    central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its rea-\n    soning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in-\n    stead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amend-\n    ment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion\n    criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and\n    substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short,\n    either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analy-\n    sis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed\n    what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority\n    might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the\n    abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new\n    test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-\n    dent. Pp. 45–56.\n          (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be over-\n    ruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that\n    is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and pre-\n    dictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test has scored poorly on the\n    workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the\n    “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these\n    rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Ca-\n    sey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881–\n    887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\n    ing in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further\n    evidence that Casey’s “line between” permissible and unconstitutional\n    restrictions “has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.” Ja-\n    nus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit con-\n    flicts. Continued adherence to Casey’s unworkable “undue burden”\n    test would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and\n    consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827.\n    Pp. 56–62.\n          (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the\n    distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that\n    effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ra-\n    mos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in\n    part). Pp. 62–63.\n          (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend\n    concrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving\n    property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the\n    controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were\n"

S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible\nform of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate rela-\ntionships and made choices that define their views of themselves and\ntheir places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in\nthe event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of\nwomen to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Na-\ntion has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\nlives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the\nlives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality’s\nspeculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests\nof the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the “original\nconstitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson\nv. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730.\n   The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would\nthreaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause.\nThe Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional\nright to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be\nunderstood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\nPp. 63–66.\n   (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the\npublic will perceive a decision overruling a controversial “watershed”\ndecision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or pub-\nlic opinion. 505 U. S., at 866–867. But the Court cannot allow its de-\ncisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this\nCourt is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which\nadherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If\nthe rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be\nthe law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding\nprinciples of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66–69.\n   (d) Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con-\nstitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a funda-\nmental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate\nabortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are chal-\nlenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson,\n372 U. S., at 729–730. That applies even when the laws at issue con-\ncern matters of great social significance and moral substance.

It\n    must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature\n    could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id.,\n    at 320.\n       Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi\n    Legislature’s specific findings, which include the State’s asserted in-\n    terest in “protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i).

Some believe fervently\nthat a human person comes into being at conception and\nthat abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as\nstrongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman’s\nright to control her own body and prevents women from\nachieving full equality. Still others in a third group think\nthat abortion should be allowed under some but not all cir-\ncumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of\nviews about the particular restrictions that should be im-\nposed.\n   For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitu-\ntion, each State was permitted to address this issue in ac-\ncordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this\nCourt decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the\nConstitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held\nthat it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim\nthat American law or the common law had ever recognized\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 [10] "2   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch a right, and its survey of history ranged from the con-\nstitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in an-\ntiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abor-\ntion was probably never a crime under the common law).\nAfter cataloging a wealth of other information having no\nbearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion\nconcluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that\nmight be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.\n   Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was reg-\nulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at\nroughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time,\ncorresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to\nachieve “viability,” i.e., the ability to survive outside the\nwomb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had\na legitimate interest in protecting “potential life,”1 it found\nthat this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-\nviability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for\nthis line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard\nto defend Roe’s reasoning. One prominent constitutional\nscholar wrote that he “would vote for a statute very much\nlike the one the Court end[ed] up drafting” if he were “a\nlegislator,” but his assessment of Roe was memorable and\nbrutal: Roe was “not constitutional law” at all and gave “al-\nmost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”2\n   At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at\nall stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third\nof the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly\nended that political process. It imposed the same highly\nrestrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively\nstruck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As\n\n——————\n  1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.

S.,\nat 222, and it sparked a national controversy that has em-\nbittered our political culture for a half century.4\n   Eventually, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.\nCasey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court revisited Roe, but the\nMembers of the Court split three ways. Two Justices ex-\npressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others\nwanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the\nthree remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling\nopinion, took a third position.7 Their opinion did not en-\ndorse Roe’s reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more\nof its authors might have “reservations” about whether the\nConstitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion\nconcluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions\nto be followed in most instances, required adherence to\nwhat it called Roe’s “central holding”—that a State may not\nconstitutionally protect fetal life before “viability”—even if\nthat holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion\nclaimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the\nrule of law.\n   Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount\nof overruling.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noverruled in toto, and Roe itself was overruled in part.10 Ca-\nsey threw out Roe’s trimester scheme and substituted a new\nrule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden\nto adopt any regulation that imposed an “undue burden” on\na woman’s right to have an abortion.11 The decision pro-\nvided no clear guidance about the difference between a\n“due” and an “undue” burden. But the three Justices who\nauthored the controlling opinion “call[ed] the contending\nsides of a national controversy to end their national divi-\nsion” by treating the Court’s decision as the final settlement\nof the question of the constitutional right to abortion.12\n   As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening\nyears, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue\nto hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion,\nand state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have\nrecently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few re-\nstrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly\nrestricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in\nthis case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to over-\nrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or pro-\nhibit pre-viability abortions.\n   Before us now is one such state law. The State of Missis-\nsippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that\ngenerally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of preg-\nnancy—several weeks before the point at which a fetus is\nnow regarded as “viable” outside the womb.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nopinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to\nRoe’s abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously\nwrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally\nweak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\nAnd far from bringing about a national settlement of the\nabortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and\ndeepened division.\n  It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of\nabortion to the people’s elected representatives. “The per-\nmissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to\nbe resolved like most important questions in our democ-\nracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then\nvoting.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the\nConstitution and the rule of law demand.\n                              I\n   The law at issue in this case, Mississippi’s Gestational\nAge Act, see Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191 (2018), contains\nthis central provision: “Except in a medical emergency or in\nthe case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not\nintentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abor-\ntion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational\nage of the unborn human being has been determined to be\ngreater than fifteen (15) weeks.” §4(b).14\n   To support this Act, the legislature made a series of fac-\ntual findings. It began by noting that, at the time of enact-\nment, only six countries besides the United States “per-\nmit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand\nafter the twentieth week of gestation.”15 §2(a).

Brief for Respondents 50.\n                               II\n   We begin by considering the critical question whether the\nConstitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain\nan abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling\nopinion in Casey reaffirmed Roe’s “central holding” based\nsolely on the doctrine of stare decisis, but as we will explain,\nproper application of stare decisis required an assessment\nof the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based.

Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186–189\n(1824), which offers a “fixed standard” for ascertaining\nwhat our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commen-\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States §399, p. 383\n(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a\nright to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim\nthat it protects such a right must show that the right is\nsomehow implicit in the constitutional text.\n   Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of\nthe constitutional text. It held that the abortion right,\nwhich is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right\nto privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at\n152–153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been\nfound to spring from no fewer than five different constitu-\ntional provisions—the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\nFourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152.\n   The Court’s discussion left open at least three ways in\nwhich some combination of these provisions could protect\nthe abortion right. One possibility was that the right was\n“founded . . . in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of\nrights to the people.” Id., at 153. Another was that the\nright was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment,\nor in some combination of those provisions, and that this\nright had been “incorporated” into the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of\nRights provisions had by then been incorporated.

S. 742, 763–766 (2010)\n(majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third\npath was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments\nplayed no role and that the right was simply a component\nof the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nDue Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed\nthe “feel[ing]” that the Fourteenth Amendment was the pro-\nvision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that\nthe abortion right could be found somewhere in the Consti-\ntution and that specifying its exact location was not of par-\namount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this\nunfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely\non the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of\nthe “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due\nProcess Clause.\n   We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing\nso, we briefly address one additional constitutional provi-\nsion that some of respondents’ amici have now offered as\nyet another potential home for the abortion right: the Four-\nteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United\nStates); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional\nLaw Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw\nfit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our\nprecedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of\nabortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not\nsubject to the “heightened scrutiny” that applies to such\nclassifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that\n\n——————\n  16 The Court’s words were as follows: “This right of privacy, whether it\n\nbe founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty\nand restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the peo-\nple, is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to\nterminate her pregnancy.” 410 U.

Aiello, 417\nU. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated,\nthe “goal of preventing abortion” does not constitute “invid-\niously discriminatory animus” against women. Bray v. Al-\nexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273–274\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,\nlaws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to\nheightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the\nsame standard of review as other health and safety\nmeasures.18\n  With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey’s bold\nassertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the “liberty”\nprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. 505 U. S., at 846; Brief for Respondents 17;\nBrief for United States 21–22.\n                              2\n  The underlying theory on which this argument rests—\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause pro-\nvides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for “lib-\nerty”—has long been controversial. But our decisions have\nheld that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of\nsubstantive rights.\n  The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight\nAmendments. Those Amendments originally applied only\nto the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor\nof Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247–251 (1833) (opinion for the\nCourt by Marshall, C.

That is why the Court has long\nbeen “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not mentioned\nin the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S.\n115, 125 (1992). “Substantive due process has at times been\na treacherous field for this Court,” Moore v. East Cleveland,\n431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has\nsometimes led the Court to usurp authority that the Con-\nstitution entrusts to the people’s elected representatives.\nSee Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225–\n226 (1985). As the Court cautioned in Glucksberg, “[w]e\nmust . . . exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked\nto break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected\nby the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the\npolicy preferences of the Members of this Court.” 521 U.

S., at 503 (plurality opinion), it has\nfallen into the freewheeling judicial policymaking that\ncharacterized discredited decisions such as Lochner v. New\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The Court must not fall prey to\nsuch an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the his-\ntory and tradition that map the essential components of our\nNation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the\nFourteenth Amendment means by the term “liberty.” When\nwe engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear an-\nswer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect\n\n\n\n——————\n 21 Four Essays on Liberty 121 (1969).\n"

 [24] "16   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Not only was there no support for such a constitutional\nright until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a\ncrime in every single State. At common law, abortion was\ncriminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was re-\ngarded as unlawful and could have very serious conse-\nquences at all stages. American law followed the common\nlaw until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex-\npanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the\nadoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of\nthe States had made abortion a crime at any stage of preg-\nnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.\n  Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey\ndeclined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis. It is\ntherefore important to set the record straight.\n                             2\n                             a\n  We begin with the common law, under which abortion\nwas a crime at least after “quickening”—i.e., the first felt\nmovement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs\nbetween the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24\n\n——————\narticulate on paper” the argument that “a woman’s right to choose abor-\ntion was a fundamental individual freedom protected by the U. S. Con-\nstitution’s guarantee of personal liberty”).\n   24 The exact meaning of “quickening” is subject to some debate. Com-\n\npare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Amici Curiae 12–14, and\nn. 32 (emphasis deleted) (“ ‘a quick child’ ” meant simply a “live” child,\nand under the era’s outdated knowledge of embryology, a fetus was\nthought to become “quick” at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with\nBrief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 2\n(“quick” and “quickening” consistently meant “the woman’s perception of\nfetal movement”). We need not wade into this debate. First, it suffices\nfor present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the\n16th or 18th week of pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the\nrelevant period—i.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Four-\nteenth Amendment—the quickening distinction was abandoned as\nStates criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nof Abortion History 126, and n. 16, 134–142, 188–194, and\nnn. 84–86 (2006) (Dellapenna); J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors\nand the Law 3–12 (1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example,\nEleanor Beare was convicted of “destroying the Foetus in\nthe Womb” of another woman and “thereby causing her to\nmiscarry.”26 For that crime and another “misdemeanor,”\nBeare was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three\nyears’ imprisonment.27\n   Although a pre-quickening abortion was not itself consid-\nered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permis-\nsible at common law—much less that abortion was a legal\nright. Cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of “com-\nmon law’s harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance\nof suicide”). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case men-\ntioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with\nno mention of quickening) that he had “never met with a\ncase so barbarous and unnatural.”28 Similarly, an indict-\nment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-\nquickening and post-quickening abortion, described abor-\ntion as “pernicious” and “against the peace of our Lady the\nQueen, her crown and dignity.” Keown 7 (discussing R. v.\nWebb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512\n(1980)).\n   That the common law did not condone even pre-\nquickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a\nproto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a\nway in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the\nlevel of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a\nwoman “with child” a “potion” to cause an abortion, and the\nwoman died, it was “murder” because the potion was given\n“unlawfully to destroy her child within her.” 1 Hale 429–\n430 (emphasis added).

In the case of an abortionist, Black-\nstone wrote, “the law will imply [malice]” for the same rea-\nson that it would imply malice if a person who intended to\nkill one person accidentally killed a different person:\n     “[I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is\n     murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which\n     the law transfers from one to the other. The same is\n     the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against\n     whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it,\n     and it kills him; this is likewise murder.

See generally Del-\nlapenna 215–228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652,\nfor example, an indictment charged that a man “Mur-\ntherously endeavoured to destroy or Murther the Child by\nhim begotten in the Womb.” Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md.\nArchives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the\n19th century, courts frequently explained that the common\nlaw made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e.g., Smith\nv. Gaffard, 31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857); Smith v. State, 33 Me. 48,\n55 (1851); State v. Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 52–55 (1849); Com-\nmonwealth v.

At that time, there\nwere no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its\nearly stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: “[U]ntil\nthe period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and\nwhatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon\nthis period of gestation as the time when the child is en-\ndowed with life” because “foetal movements are the first\nclearly marked and well defined evidences of life.” Evans v.\nPeople, 49 N. Y. 86, 90 (emphasis added); Cooper, 22\nN. J.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Solicitor General offers a different explanation of the\nbasis for the quickening rule, namely, that before quicken-\ning the common law did not regard a fetus “as having a ‘sep-\narate and independent existence.’ ” Brief for United States\n26 (quoting Parker, 50 Mass., at 266). But the case on\nwhich the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also\nsuggested that the criminal law’s quickening rule was out\nof step with the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of\nlaw, noting that “to many purposes, in reference to civil\nrights, an infant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person\nin being.” Ibid. (citing 1 Blackstone 129); see also Evans,\n49 N. Y., at 89; Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633\n(1850); Morrow v. Scott, 7 Ga. 535, 537 (1849); Hall v.

Rep. 117, 163 (1789).\n   At any rate, the original ground for the quickening rule\nis of little importance for present purposes because the rule\nwas abandoned in the 19th century. During that period,\ntreatise writers and commentators criticized the quicken-\ning distinction as “neither in accordance with the result of\nmedical experience, nor with the principles of the common\nlaw.” F.

Moreover, Hale and\nBlackstone (and many other authorities following them) as-\nserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful”\nand that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if\nthe woman died from the attempt.\n   Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely\non two articles by a pro-abortion advocate who claimed that\nCoke had intentionally misstated the common law because\nof his strong anti-abortion views.37 These articles have\n\n——————\n  36 See 410 U.

 [36] "28   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlate 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-\nquickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought\nthe States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures\nbegan to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no\none, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they en-\nacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising\nsince common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned\nabortion and described it as an “unlawful” act without re-\ngard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See\nsupra, at 16–21.\n   Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see\nBrief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance\nof the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the\nFourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that\nthey were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to\nthis account, which is based almost entirely on statements\nmade by one prominent proponent of the statutes, im-\nportant motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic im-\nmigrants were having more babies than Protestants and\nthat the availability of abortion was leading White\nProtestant women to “shir[k their] maternal duties.” Brief\nfor American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae\n20.\n   Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any\nreal historical support for the right that Roe and Casey rec-\nognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based\non alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap’s A. M.,\n529 U. S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion); Turner Broad-\ncasting System, Inc. v.

Recall that at the time of the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States\nhad adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all\nstages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century\nuntil the day Roe was handed down, every single State had\nsuch a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds\nof lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws\nwere motivated by hostility to Catholics and women?\n   There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws\nwas instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a\nhuman being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th\nand early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash\nv. Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State\nv.

S., at 159 (abortion\nis “inherently different”); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852 (abortion\nis “a unique act”). None of the other decisions cited by Roe\nand Casey involved the critical moral question posed by\nabortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not sup-\nport the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token,\nour conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a\nright does not undermine them in any way.\n                               2\n  In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion\nright and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Casey’s\nclaim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that “the\n"

 [44] "36   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ndevastating to its position. We have held that the “estab-\nlished method of substantive-due-process analysis” re-\nquires that an unenumerated right be “ ‘deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition’ ” before it can be recog-\nnized as a component of the “liberty” protected in the Due\nProcess Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs,\n586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissent’s\nprofessed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage\nwith that important precedent—which it cannot possibly\nsatisfy.\n   The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepre-\nsenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests\nthat we have focused only on “the legal status of abortion in\nthe 19th century,” post, at 26, but our review of this Na-\ntion’s tradition extends well past that period. As explained,\nfor more than a century after 1868—including “another\nhalf-century” after women gained the constitutional right\nto vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19—it was firmly es-\ntablished that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law\nat issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regula-\ntory authority. And today, another half century later, more\nthan half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and\nCasey.

First, if the “long\nsweep of history” imposes any restraint on the recognition\nof unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since\nabortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the\nmother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before\nthat decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to\ndefend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the prec-\nedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were\ncritically different for a reason that we have explained:\nNone of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe\ncalled “potential life.” See supra, at 32.\n   So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe’s\nreasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent’s pro-\nposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact\nthat a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe\nand later decisions that accepted Roe’s interpretation. Un-\nder the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are enti-\ntled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage\nin that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time\nand time again, adherence to precedent is not “ ‘an inexora-\nble command.’ ” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576\nU. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past deci-\nsions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one\nof them.\n                              3\n  The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of\nany serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States’ inter-\nest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy\nthat the dissent draws between the abortion right and the\nrights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt\n(same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same\nsex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).

 [46] "38   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndesigned to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will im-\nperil those other rights, but the dissent’s analogy is objec-\ntionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about\nthe dissent’s views on the protection of what Roe called “po-\ntential life.” The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold,\nEisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell does not destroy a “po-\ntential life,” but an abortion has that effect. So if the rights\nat issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the\nright recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear:\nThe Constitution does not permit the States to regard the\ndestruction of a “potential life” as a matter of any signifi-\ncance.\n   That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent\nhas much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women,\nthe burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by\npoor women. These are important concerns. However, the\ndissent evinces no similar regard for a State’s interest in\nprotecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the\n“balance,” post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line\nstrikes between a woman’s liberty interest and the State’s\ninterest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later,\nsee infra, at 50–54, 55–56, and given in the opinion of THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 2–5 (opinion concurring in judg-\nment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not ade-\nquately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try\nto defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a\npregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the\ndestruction of a fetus.\n   Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when\nprenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after\nbirth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people\na particular theory about when the rights of personhood\nbegin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires\nthe States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic\nhuman right—to live—at least until an arbitrary point in a\npregnancy has passed.

An erro-\nneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the\nConstitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to\namend. See Art. V; Kimble, 576 U. S., at 456. Therefore, in\nappropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider\nand, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions.\n   Some of our most important constitutional decisions have\noverruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown\nv. Board of Education, 347 U.

Id., at 488 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). In so doing, the Court overruled the infamous decision\nin Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with six\nother Supreme Court precedents that had applied the\nseparate-but-equal rule. See Brown, 347 U. S., at 491.\n   In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937),\nthe Court overruled Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D. C.,\n261 U. S. 525 (1923), which had held that a law setting min-\nimum wages for women violated the “liberty” protected by\nthe Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Id., at 545.\nWest Coast Hotel signaled the demise of an entire line of\nimportant precedents that had protected an individual lib-\nerty right against state and federal health and welfare leg-\nislation.

(slip op.,\nat 7), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral argument,\nit should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity,\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 92–93.\n   Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging.\nFor reasons already explained, Roe’s constitutional analysis\nwas far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation\nof the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely\npointed.\n   Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from\nthe day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and\nthose errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law\nof little importance to the American people. Rather, wield-\ning nothing but “raw judicial power,” Roe, 410 U. S., at 222\n(White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the power to ad-\ndress a question of profound moral and social importance\nthat the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people.\nCasey described itself as calling both sides of the national\ncontroversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey\nnecessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing\nside—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in\nfetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected\nrepresentatives to adopt policies consistent with their\nviews. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by\nclosing it to the large number of Americans who dissented\nin any respect from Roe. “Roe fanned into life an issue that\nhas inflamed our national politics in general, and has ob-\nscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court\nin particular, ever since.” Casey, 505 U.

Roe’s rea-\nsoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from\nsupporters of broad access to abortion.\n   The Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roe’s central hold-\ning, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reason-\ning. It revised the textual basis for the abortion right, si-\nlently abandoned Roe’s erroneous historical narrative, and\njettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that\nscheme with an arbitrary “undue burden” test and relied on\nan exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained be-\nlow, this Court had never before applied and has never in-\nvoked since.\n                              1\n                              a\n   The weaknesses in Roe’s reasoning are well-known.\nWithout any grounding in the constitutional text, history,\nor precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set\nof rules much like those that one might expect to find in a\nstatute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163–164. Dividing\npregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special\nrules for each. During the first trimester, the Court an-\nnounced, “the abortion decision and its effectuation must be\nleft to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman’s at-\ntending physician.” Id., at 164. After that point, a State’s\ninterest in regulating abortion for the sake of a woman’s\nhealth became compelling, and accordingly, a State could\n“regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasona-\nbly related to maternal health.” Ibid. Finally, in “the stage\nsubsequent to viability,” which in 1973 roughly coincided\nwith the beginning of the third trimester, the State’s inter-\nest in “the potentiality of human life” became compelling,\nand therefore a State could “regulate, and even proscribe,\nabortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medi-\ncal judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the\nmother.” Id., at 164–165.\n"

Relying on two\ndiscredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court er-\nroneously suggested—contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale,\nBlackstone, and a wealth of other authority—that the com-\nmon law had probably never really treated post-quickening\nabortion as a crime. See id., at 136 (“[I]t now appear[s]\ndoubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a com-\nmon-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a\nquick fetus”). This erroneous understanding appears to\nhave played an important part in the Court’s thinking be-\ncause the opinion cited “the lenity of the common law” as\none of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at\n165.\n   After surveying history, the opinion spent many para-\ngraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be un-\ndertaken by a legislative committee. This included a\nlengthy account of the “position of the American Medical\nAssociation” and “[t]he position of the American Public\nHealth Association,” as well as the vote by the American\nBar Association’s House of Delegates in February 1972 on\nproposed abortion legislation. Id., at 141, 144, 146 (empha-\nsis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision\nhanded down in 1939 and a new British abortion law en-\nacted in 1967. Id., at 137–138. The Court did not explain\nwhy these sources shed light on the meaning of the Consti-\ntution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything\nlike the scheme that Roe imposed on the country.\n   Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Cit-\ning a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a\nconstitutional “right of personal privacy,” id., at 152, but it\nconflated two very different meanings of the term: the right\n"

The Court’s only ex-\nplanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage\nwere lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at\n163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates\nwere the only factor that a State could legitimately con-\nsider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid ad-\nverse health consequences short of death. And the Court\ndid not explain why it departed from the normal rule that\ncourts defer to the judgments of legislatures “in areas\nfraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.” Mar-\nshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974).\n   An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to jus-\ntify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-\nviability abortions. Here is the Court’s entire explanation:\n       “With respect to the State’s important and legitimate\n     interest in potential life, the ‘compelling’ point is at vi-\n     ability. This is so because the fetus then presumably\n     has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb.”\n     410 U. S., at 163.\nAs Professor Laurence Tribe has written, “[c]learly, this\nmistakes ‘a definition for a syllogism.’ ” Tribe 4 (quoting Ely\n924). The definition of a “viable” fetus is one that is capable\nof surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at\nwhich the State’s interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe\nheld, a State’s interest in protecting prenatal life is compel-\nling “after viability,” 410 U. S., at 163, why isn’t that inter-\nest “equally compelling before viability”? Webster v. Repro-\nductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality\nopinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (White, J.,\ndissenting)).

Due to\nthe development of new equipment and improved practices,\nthe viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th\ncentury, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or\n33d week of pregnancy or even later.51 When Roe was de-\ncided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410\nU. S., at 160. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24\nweeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roe’s logic,\nStates now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus\nwith a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States\ndid not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus.\nHow can that be?\n  Viability also depends on the “quality of the available\nmedical facilities.” Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 396\n(1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman\ngives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced\ncare for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to\na remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no\nlonger be viable. On what ground could the constitutional\nstatus of a fetus depend on the pregnant woman’s location?\nAnd if viability is meant to mark a line having universal\nmoral significance, can it be that a fetus that is viable in a\nbig city in the United States has a privileged moral status\n\n——————\n   51 See W.

S., at 794 (dissent-\ning opinion). And the United States as amicus curiae asked\nthe Court to overrule Roe five times in the decade before\nCasey, see 505 U.

The Court\nabandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead\ngrounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The\nCourt did not reaffirm Roe’s erroneous account of abortion\nhistory. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said\nanything about the history of the abortion right. And as for\nprecedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of\ncases that Roe had cited. Thus, with respect to the standard\ngrounds for constitutional decisionmaking—text, history,\nand precedent—Casey did not attempt to bolster Roe’s rea-\nsoning.\n   The Court also made no real effort to remedy one of the\ngreatest weaknesses in Roe’s analysis: its much-criticized\ndiscussion of viability. The Court retained what it called\nRoe’s “central holding”—that a State may not regulate pre-\nviability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal life—\nbut it provided no principled defense of the viability line.\n505 U. S., at 860, 870–871. Instead, it merely rephrased\nwhat Roe had said, stating that viability marked the point\nat which “the independent existence of a second life can in\nreason and fairness be the object of state protection that\nnow overrides the rights of the woman.” 505 U. S., at 870.\nWhy “reason and fairness” demanded that the line be\ndrawn at viability the Court did not explain.

S., at 992; see also June Medi-\ncal Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020)\n(GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17) (“[W]hether a bur-\nden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the\njudge considers and how much weight he accords each of\nthem” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).\n   The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the “undue\nburden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these\nrules created their own problems. The first rule is that “a\nprovision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place\na substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an\nabortion before the fetus attains viability.” 505 U. S., at 878\n(emphasis added); see also id., at 877. But whether a par-\nticular obstacle qualifies as “substantial” is often open to\nreasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, “substan-\ntial” means “of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or\nsize.” Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary\n1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly “substantial,”\nand trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes,\nthere is a wide gray area.\n   This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which\napplies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further.\nIt states that measures designed “to ensure that the\nwoman’s choice is informed” are constitutional so long as\nthey do not impose “an undue burden on the right.” Casey,\n505 U.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ground that it creates an “undue burden” because the\nburden it imposes, though slight, outweighs its negligible\nbenefits? Casey does not say, and this ambiguity would lead\nto confusion down the line. Compare June Medical, 591\nU. S., at ___–___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 1–2), with\nid., at ___–___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring) (slip op., at 5–\n6).\n   The third rule complicates the picture even more. Under\nthat rule, “[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the\npurpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a\nwoman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the\nright.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 878 (emphasis added). This rule\ncontains no fewer than three vague terms. It includes the\ntwo already discussed—“undue burden” and “substantial\nobstacle”—even though they are inconsistent. And it adds\na third ambiguous term when it refers to “unnecessary\nhealth regulations.” The term “necessary” has a range of\nmeanings—from “essential” to merely “useful.” See Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Casey did not\nexplain the sense in which the term is used in this rule.\n   In addition to these problems, one more applies to all\nthree rules. They all call on courts to examine a law’s effect\non women, but a regulation may have a very different im-\npact on different women for a variety of reasons, including\ntheir places of residence, financial resources, family situa-\ntions, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal\ndevelopment and abortion, psychological and emotional dis-\nposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to\nobtain abortions. In order to determine whether a regula-\ntion presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs\nto know which set of women it should have in mind and how\nmany of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is\n“substantial.”\n   Casey provided no clear answer to these questions.

Nor is it clear what the Court meant by “cases in\nwhich” a regulation is “relevant.” These ambiguities have\ncaused confusion and disagreement. Compare Whole\nWoman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.

S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 34–\n35).\n                              1\n   Traditional reliance interests arise “where advance plan-\nning of great precision is most obviously a necessity.” Ca-\nsey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne, 501\nU. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded\nthat those traditional reliance interests were not implicated\nbecause getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activ-\nity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually imme-\ndiate account of any sudden restoration of state authority\nto ban abortions.” 505 U. S., at 856. For these reasons, we\nagree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete\nreliance interests are not present here.\n                               2\n   Unable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the con-\ntrolling opinion in Casey perceived a more intangible form\nof reliance. It wrote that “people [had] organized intimate\nrelationships and made choices that define their views of\nthemselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the\navailability of abortion in the event that contraception\nshould fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation has\nbeen facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive\nlives.” Ibid. But this Court is ill-equipped to assess “gen-\neralized assertions about the national psyche.” Id., at 957\n(opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). Casey’s notion of reliance thus\nfinds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize\nvery concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in\n“cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501\nU.

That form of reliance depends on an em-\npirical question that is hard for anyone—and in particular,\nfor a court—to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion\nright on society and in particular on the lives of women.\nThe contending sides in this case make impassioned and\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right\non the lives of women.

The\ncontending sides also make conflicting arguments about the\nstatus of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority\nnor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Ca-\nsey plurality’s speculations and weighing of the relative im-\nportance of the fetus and mother represent a departure\nfrom the “original constitutional proposition” that “courts\ndo not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the\njudgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372\nU. S. 726, 729–730 (1963).\n    Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legis-\nlative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the abor-\ntion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influ-\nencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and\nrunning for office. Women are not without electoral or po-\nlitical power.

S., at 866–867. A deci-\nsion overruling Roe would be perceived as having been\nmade “under fire” and as a “surrender to political pressure,”\n505 U.

S., at 869.\n   This analysis starts out on the right foot but ultimately\nveers off course. The Casey plurality was certainly right\nthat it is important for the public to perceive that our deci-\nsions are based on principle, and we should make every ef-\nfort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that care-\nfully show how a proper understanding of the law leads to\nthe results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our\nauthority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our\ndecisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such\nas concern about the public’s reaction to our work. Cf.\nTexas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); Brown, 347 U. S.\n483. That is true both when we initially decide a constitu-\ntional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a\nprior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, “The\nJudicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following\npublic opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether\nlegislative enactments of the popular branches of Govern-\nment comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare\ndecisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more\nsubject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic\njudicial task.” Casey, 505 U.

In suggesting\notherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Court’s role\nin our constitutional system.\n   The Casey plurality “call[ed] the contending sides of a na-\ntional controversy to end their national division,” and\nclaimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of\nthe issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying\n"

That unprece-\ndented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Con-\nstitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Con-\nstitution gives the judiciary “neither Force nor Will.” The\nFederalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole au-\nthority is to exercise “judgment”—which is to say, the au-\nthority to judge what the law means and how it should ap-\nply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority\nto decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently ex-\nempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis princi-\nples. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual prin-\nciples of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent\nis the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule\nwere otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Loch-\nner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis op-\nerates.\n   The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of\nthis Court’s influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in end-\ning division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe\n“inflamed” a national issue that has remained bitterly divi-\nsive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opin-\nion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judi-\ncial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may\nhave “halted a political process,” “prolonged divisiveness,”\nand “deferred stable settlement of the issue”). And for the\npast 30 years, Casey has done the same.\n   Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a\nconstitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this\ncase, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey\nand to return the issue of abortion to the people and their\nelected representatives. This Court’s inability to end de-\nbate on the issue should not have been surprising. This\nCourt cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a\nrancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settle-\nment and telling the people to move on.

Does the dissent really\nmaintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the\ncountry had experienced more than a half-century of state-\nsanctioned segregation and generations of Black school\nchildren had suffered all its effects? Post, at 44–45.\n   Here is another example. On the dissent’s view, it must\nhave been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,\n319 U. S. 624, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v. Gobi-\ntis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed\ndown. In both cases, children who were Jehovah’s Wit-\nnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or re-\ncite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not\nclaim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by\nany intervening legal or factual developments, so if the\nCourt had followed the dissent’s new version of stare deci-\nsis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and\ncountenance continued First Amendment violations for\nsome unspecified period.\n   Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court\nerrs, and occasionally the Court issues an important deci-\nsion that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare\ndecisis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent even-\ntually admits that a decision could “be overruled just be-\ncause it is terribly wrong,” though the dissent does not ex-\nplain when that would be so. Post, at 45.\n                                2\n  Even if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egre-\ngiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled\nunless its mistake is later highlighted by “major legal or\nfactual changes,” reexamination of Roe and Casey would be\namply justified. We have already mentioned a number of\npost-Casey developments, see supra, at 33–34, 59–63, but\nthe most profound change may be the failure of the Casey\nplurality’s call for “the contending sides” in the controversy\nabout abortion “to end their national division,” 505 U.

That has not happened, and there is no reason to think\nthat another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what\nCasey could not.\n   The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the\n“very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey” is an im-\nportant stare decisis consideration that requires upholding\nthose precedents. See post, at 55–57. The dissent charac-\nterizes Casey as a “precedent about precedent” that is per-\nmanently shielded from further evaluation under tradi-\ntional stare decisis principles. See post, at 57. But as we\nhave explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated\nthe national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for\nrefusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case\nhas relied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies\nlongstanding stare decisis factors instead of applying a ver-\nsion of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion\ncases.\n                               3\n   Finally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into\nquestion Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell.\nPost, at 4–5, 26–27, n. 8. But we have stated unequivocally\nthat “[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast\ndoubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.” Supra,\nat 66. We have also explained why that is so: rights regard-\ning contraception and same-sex relationships are inher-\nently different from the right to abortion because the latter\n(as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey\ntermed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis de-\nleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abor-\ntion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights\nrecognized in those other cases or by “appeals to a broader\nright to autonomy.” Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we\ncould be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these\ncases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the\ndissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare\n"

That opinion (which for convenience\nwe will call simply “the concurrence”) recommends a “more\nmeasured course,” which it defends based on what it claims\nis “a straightforward stare decisis analysis.” Post, at 1\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The concurrence would “leave\nfor another day whether to reject any right to an abortion\nat all,” post, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitu-\ntion protects any such right, the right ends once women\nhave had “a reasonable opportunity” to obtain an abortion,\npost, at 1. The concurrence does not specify what period of\ntime is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it\nwould hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Missis-\nsippi’s law, is enough—at least “absent rare circum-\nstances.” Post, at 2, 10.\n   There are serious problems with this approach, and it is\nrevealing that nothing like it was recommended by either\nparty. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor\nGeneral have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe\nand Casey. See supra, at 4–5. And when the specific ap-\nproach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral\nargument, both respondents and the Solicitor General em-\nphatically rejected it. Respondents’ counsel termed it “com-\npletely unworkable” and “less principled and less workable\nthan viability.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 54.

S. 310, 384 (2010)\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). Therefore, a new rule that\ndiscards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare deci-\nsis grounds.\n   The concurrence concedes that its approach would “not be\navailable” if “the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextrica-\nbly entangled with and dependent upon the viability stand-\nard.” Post, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the via-\nbility line is separable from the constitutional right they\nrecognized, and can therefore be “discarded” without dis-\nturbing any past precedent. Post, at 7–8. That is simply\nincorrect.\n   Roe’s trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see\n410 U. S., at 163–164, and viability played a critical role in\nlater abortion decisions.         For example, in Planned\nParenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.

 [82] "74   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 63–64. If viability was not an essential part of the rule\nadopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make\nthat comparison.\n   The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, is even\nmore instructive. In that case, the Court noted that prior\ncases had “stressed viability” and reiterated that “[v]iabil-\nity is the critical point” under Roe. 439 U. S., at 388–389.\nIt then struck down Pennsylvania’s definition of viability,\nid., at 389–394, and it is hard to see how the Court could\nhave done that if Roe’s discussion of viability was not part\nof its holding.\n   When the Court reconsidered Roe in Casey, it left no\ndoubt about the importance of the viability rule. It de-\nscribed the rule as Roe’s “central holding,” 505 U. S., at 860,\nand repeatedly stated that the right it reaffirmed was “the\nright of the woman to choose to have an abortion before vi-\nability.” Id., at 846 (emphasis added). See id., at 871 (“The\nwoman’s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability\nis the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of\nlaw and a component of liberty we cannot renounce” (em-\nphasis added)); id., at 872 (A “woman has a right to choose\nto terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability”\n(emphasis added)); id., at 879 (“[A] State may not prohibit\nany woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate\nher pregnancy before viability” (emphasis added)).\n   Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize the\ncentrality of the viability rule. See Whole Women’s Health,\n579 U. S., at 589–590 (“[A] provision of law is constitution-\nally invalid, if the ‘purpose or effect’ of the provision ‘is to\nplace a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking\nan abortion before the fetus attains viability’ ” (emphasis de-\nleted and added)); id., at 627 (“[W]e now use ‘viability’ as\nthe relevant point at which a State may begin limiting\nwomen’s access to abortion for reasons unrelated to mater-\nnal health” (emphasis added)).\n"

In Casey, the Court held that Pennsylva-\nnia’s spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitu-\ntional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to\nabortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had\na reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U. S., at 887–\n898. The same is true of Whole Women’s Health, which held\nthat certain rules that required physicians performing\nabortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital\nwere facially unconstitutional because they placed “a sub-\nstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previabil-\nity abortion.” 579 U. S., at 591 (emphasis added).\n    For all these reasons, stare decisis cannot justify the new\n“reasonable opportunity” rule propounded by the concur-\nrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must\nstand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to\nshow that this rule represents a correct interpretation of\nthe Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the\nright to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is\n“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ ” and\n“ ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’ ” Glucksberg,\n521 U. S., at 720–721. Nor does it propound any other the-\nory that could show that the Constitution supports its new\nrule. And if the Constitution protects a woman’s right to\nobtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that\nright should end after the point at which all “reasonable”\nwomen will have decided whether to seek an abortion.\nWhile the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial min-\nimalism, “we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision\nsimply because it is narrow; it must also be right.” Citizens\nUnited, 558 U. S., at 375 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). For\nthe reasons that we have explained, the concurrence’s ap-\nproach is not.\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 [84] "76   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               3\n   The concurrence would “leave for another day whether to\nreject any right to an abortion at all,” post, at 7, but “an-\nother day” would not be long in coming. Some States have\nset deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter\nthan Mississippi’s. See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproduc-\ntive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law\nwith bans “at cascading intervals of two to three weeks” be-\nginning at six weeks), reh’g en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550\n(CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippi’s 15-week rule\nis constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on\nthe constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter dead-\nlines or no deadline at all. The “measured course” charted\nby the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the\nCourt answered the question that the concurrence seeks to\ndefer.\n   Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule sug-\ngested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the dif-\nficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example,\nif the period required to give women a “reasonable” oppor-\ntunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concur-\nrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percent-\nage of women make that choice, see post, at 1–2, 9–10, we\nwould have to identify the relevant percentage. It would\nalso be necessary to explain what the concurrence means\nwhen it refers to “rare circumstances” that might justify an\nexception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give\nwomen a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it\nwould be necessary to decide whether factors other than\npromptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether\nsuch an opportunity was available.\n   In sum, the concurrence’s quest for a middle way would\nonly put off the day when we would be forced to confront the\nquestion we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and\nCasey would be prolonged. It is far better—for this Court\n"

As we have explained,\nprocuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional\nright because such a right has no basis in the Constitution’s\ntext or in our Nation’s history. See supra, at 8–39.\n   It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legit-\nimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged\nunder the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their so-\ncial and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bod-\nies.” Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729–730; see also Dandridge\nv. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 484–486 (1970); United States v.\nCarolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). That re-\nspect for a legislature’s judgment applies even when the\nlaws at issue concern matters of great social significance\nand moral substance. See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ.\nof Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365–368 (2001) (“treatment\nof the disabled”); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728 (“assisted\nsuicide”); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodri-\nguez, 411 U. S. 1, 32–35, 55 (1973) (“financing public edu-\ncation”).\n   A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare\nlaws, is entitled to a “strong presumption of validity.” Hel-\nler v.

S. 297, 303\n(1976) (per curiam); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,\n348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). These legitimate interests in-\nclude respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all\nstages of development, Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157–158; the\nprotection of maternal health and safety; the elimination of\nparticularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures; the\npreservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the\nmitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race, sex, or disability. See id., at 156–\n157; Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728–\n731 (identifying similar interests).\n                                B\n   These legitimate interests justify Mississippi’s Gesta-\ntional Age Act. Except “in a medical emergency or in the\ncase of a severe fetal abnormality,” the statute prohibits\nabortion “if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu-\nman being has been determined to be greater than fifteen\n(15) weeks.” Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191(4)(b). The Mis-\nsissippi Legislature’s findings recount the stages of “human\nprenatal development” and assert the State’s interest in\n“protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). The legislature\nalso found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typi-\ncally use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the\nlegislature found the use of this procedure “for nonthera-\npeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dan-\ngerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the med-\nical profession.” §2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at\n135–143 (describing such procedures). These legitimate in-\nterests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act,\nand it follows that respondents’ constitutional challenge\nmust fail.\n                             VII\n     We end this opinion where we began.

Respond-\nents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s guarantee that no State shall “deprive any\nperson of life, liberty, or property without due process of\nlaw.” The Court well explains why, under our substantive\ndue process precedents, the purported right to abortion is\nnot a form of “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause.\nSuch a right is neither “deeply rooted in this Nation’s his-\ntory and tradition” nor “implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721\n(1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he idea that\nthe Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the\nDue Process Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical.”\nJune Medical Services L.

[118] "2   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nlife, liberty, or property. See, e.g., Johnson v. United States,\n576 U. S. 591, 623 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg-\nment). Other sources, by contrast, suggest that “due pro-\ncess of law” prohibited legislatures “from authorizing the\ndeprivation of a person’s life, liberty, or property without\nproviding him the customary procedures to which freemen\nwere entitled by the old law of England.” United States v.\nVaello Madero, 596 U. S. ___, ____ (2022) (THOMAS, J., con-\ncurring) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nEither way, the Due Process Clause at most guarantees\nprocess. It does not, as the Court’s substantive due process\ncases suppose, “forbi[d] the government to infringe certain\n‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what pro-\ncess is provided.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);\nsee also, e.g., Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125\n(1992).\n   As I have previously explained, “substantive due process”\nis an oxymoron that “lack[s] any basis in the Constitution.”\nJohnson, 576 U. S., at 607–608 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); see\nalso, e.g., Vaello Madero, 596 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., con-\ncurring) (slip op., at 3) (“[T]ext and history provide little\nsupport for modern substantive due process doctrine”).\n“The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees\nonly ‘process’ before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or\nproperty could define the substance of those rights strains\ncredulity for even the most casual user of words.” McDon-\nald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 811 (2010) (THOMAS, J., con-\ncurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also\nUnited States v. Carlton, 512 U. S. 26, 40 (1994) (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The resolution of this case is thus\nstraightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not\nsecure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to\nabortion.\n   The Court today declines to disturb substantive due pro-\ncess jurisprudence generally or the doctrine’s application in\nother, specific contexts.

The Court’s abortion cases are\nunique, see ante, at 31–32, 66, 71–72, and no party has\nasked us to decide “whether our entire Fourteenth Amend-\nment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,” McDon-\nald, 561 U.

Thus, I agree\nthat “[n]othing in [the Court’s] opinion should be under-\nstood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abor-\ntion.” Ante, at 66.\n   For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all\nof this Court’s substantive due process precedents, includ-\ning Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any sub-\nstantive due process decision is “demonstrably erroneous,”\nRamos v. Louisiana, 590 U.

After overruling these demonstra-\nbly erroneous decisions, the question would remain\nwhether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myr-\niad rights that our substantive due process cases have gen-\nerated. For example, we could consider whether any of the\nrights announced in this Court’s substantive due process\ncases are “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\nStates” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Connecticut purported not to rely on the Due Process\nClause, but rather reasoned “that specific guarantees in the Bill of\nRights”—including rights enumerated in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth,\nand Ninth Amendments—“have penumbras, formed by emanations,”\nthat create “zones of privacy.” 381 U. S., at 484. Since Griswold, the\nCourt, perhaps recognizing the facial absurdity of Griswold’s penumbral\nargument, has characterized the decision as one rooted in substantive\ndue process.

To answer that question, we would need to decide im-\nportant antecedent questions, including whether the Privi-\nleges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not\nenumerated in the Constitution and, if so, how to identify\nthose rights. See id., at 854. That said, even if the Clause\ndoes protect unenumerated rights, the Court conclusively\ndemonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any\nplausible interpretive approach. See ante, at 15, n. 22.\n   Moreover, apart from being a demonstrably incorrect\nreading of the Due Process Clause, the “legal fiction” of sub-\nstantive due process is “particularly dangerous.” McDon-\nald, 561 U. S., at 811 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); accord, Ober-\ngefell, 576 U. S., at 722 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). At least\nthree dangers favor jettisoning the doctrine entirely.\n   First, “substantive due process exalts judges at the ex-\npense of the People from whom they derive their authority.”\nIbid. Because the Due Process Clause “speaks only to ‘pro-\ncess,’ the Court has long struggled to define what substan-\ntive rights it protects.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___\n(2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In practice, the Court’s\napproach for identifying those “fundamental” rights “un-\nquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral le-\ngal analysis.” Carlton, 512 U. S., at 41–42 (opinion of\nScalia, J.); see also McDonald, 561 U. S., at 812 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.) (substantive due process is “a jurisprudence\ndevoid of a guiding principle”). The Court divines new\nrights in line with “its own, extraconstitutional value pref-\nerences” and nullifies state laws that do not align with the\njudicially created guarantees. Thornburgh v.

In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\n505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abor-\ntion guarantee in “the liberty protected by the Fourteenth\nAmendment,” but, rather than a “right of privacy,” it in-\nvoked an ethereal “right to define one’s own concept of ex-\nistence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of\nhuman life.” Id., at 851. As the Court’s preferred manifes-\ntation of “liberty” changed, so, too, did the test used to pro-\ntect it, as Roe’s author lamented. See Casey, 505 U. S., at\n930 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (“[T]he Roe framework is far more administrable, and\nfar less manipulable, than the ‘undue burden’ standard”).\n   Now, in this case, the nature of the purported “liberty”\nsupporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Re-\nspondents and the United States propose no fewer than\nthree different interests that supposedly spring from the\nDue Process Clause. They include “bodily integrity,” “per-\nsonal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and\nfaith,” Brief for Respondents 21, and “women’s equal citi-\nzenship,” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That\n50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still\ncannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake\nproves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a pol-\nicy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.\n   Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of\nconstitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies\na “fundamental” right for one class of individuals, it invokes\nthe Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of\nstatutes that deny the right to others. See, e.g., Eisenstadt\nv. Baird, 405 U.

Statutory classifi-\ncations implicating certain “nonfundamental” rights, mean-\nwhile, receive only cursory review. See, e.g., Armour v. In-\ndianapolis, 566 U. S. 673, 680 (2012). Similarly, this Court\ndeems unconstitutionally “vague” or “overbroad” those laws\nthat impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide\nthose laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. See,\ne.g., Johnson, 576 U. S., at 618–621 (opinion of THOMAS, J.);\nUnited States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.

Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal con-\ntext, the Court often “demand[s] extra justifications for en-\ncroachments” on “preferred rights” while “relax[ing] pur-\nportedly higher standards of review for less-\npreferred rights.” Whole Woman’s Health v.

Sand-\nford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court invoked a species of\nsubstantive due process to announce that Congress was\npowerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal ter-\nritories.

And they stress that a signifi-\ncant percentage of Americans with pro-life views are\nwomen.\n   When it comes to abortion, one interest must prevail over\nthe other at any given point in a pregnancy. Many Ameri-\ncans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the preg-\nnant woman. Many other Americans of good faith instead\nwould prioritize the interests in protecting fetal life—at\nleast unless, for example, an abortion is necessary to save\nthe life of the mother. Of course, many Americans are con-\nflicted or have nuanced views that may vary depending on\nthe particular time in pregnancy, or the particular circum-\nstances of a pregnancy.\n   The issue before this Court, however, is not the policy or\nmorality of abortion. The issue before this Court is what\nthe Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution\ndoes not take sides on the issue of abortion. The text of the\nConstitution does not refer to or encompass abortion. To be\nsure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects un-\nenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in this Nation’s\nhistory and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in Amer-\nican history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughly\nexplains.1\n   On the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore\nneither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral\nand leaves the issue for the people and their elected repre-\nsentatives to resolve through the democratic process in the\n\n——————\n  1 The Court’s opinion today also recounts the pre-constitutional\n\ncommon-law history in England. That English history supplies back-\nground information on the issue of abortion. As I see it, the dispositive\npoint in analyzing American history and tradition for purposes of the\nFourteenth Amendment inquiry is that abortion was largely prohibited\nin most American States as of 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment\nwas ratified, and that abortion remained largely prohibited in most\nAmerican States until Roe was decided in 1973.\n"

The\nnine unelected Members of this Court do not possess the\nconstitutional authority to override the democratic process\nand to decree either a pro-life or a pro-choice abortion policy\nfor all 330 million people in the United States.\n   Instead of adhering to the Constitution’s neutrality, the\nCourt in Roe took sides on the issue and unilaterally de-\ncreed that abortion was legal throughout the United States\nup to the point of viability (about 24 weeks of pregnancy).\nThe Court’s decision today properly returns the Court to a\nposition of neutrality and restores the people’s authority to\naddress the issue of abortion through the processes of dem-\nocratic self-government established by the Constitution.\n   Some amicus briefs argue that the Court today should not\nonly overrule Roe and return to a position of judicial neu-\ntrality on abortion, but should go further and hold that the\nConstitution outlaws abortion throughout the United\nStates. No Justice of this Court has ever advanced that po-\nsition. I respect those who advocate for that position, just\nas I respect those who argue that this Court should hold\nthat the Constitution legalizes pre-viability abortion\nthroughout the United States. But both positions are\nwrong as a constitutional matter, in my view. The Consti-\ntution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion.\n   To be clear, then, the Court’s decision today does not out-\nlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the con-\ntrary, the Court’s decision properly leaves the question of\nabortion for the people and their elected representatives in\nthe democratic process. Through that democratic process,\nthe people and their representatives may decide to allow or\nlimit abortion. As Justice Scalia stated, the “States may, if\nthey wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution\n"

To begin, I agree that constitutional rights ap-\nply to situations that were unforeseen in 1791 or 1868—\nsuch as applying the First Amendment to the Internet or\nthe Fourth Amendment to cars. Moreover, the Constitution\nauthorizes the creation of new rights—state and federal,\nstatutory and constitutional.

See Roe v.\nWade, 410 U. S. 113, 173 (1973). Abortion statutes traditionally and cur-\nrently provide for an exception when an abortion is necessary to protect\nthe life of the mother.

This Court’s history shows, however, that stare deci-\nsis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute.\nOtherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-since-\noverruled cases such as Plessy v.

S. 186 (1986), would never have\nbeen overruled and would still be the law.\n   In his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis\nstated that in “cases involving the Federal Constitution,\nwhere correction through legislative action is practically\nimpossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier deci-\nsions.” Burnet v.

Every current\nMember of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And\nover the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft’s\nappointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed\nto this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of\nthose Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number\nof very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g.,\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker\nv.

Bolton, 410 U. S.,\nat 221−222 (dissenting opinion).\n   Of course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egre-\ngiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent\nshould be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe\nhas caused significant negative jurisprudential and real-\nworld consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and con-\ntentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe\noverreached and exceeded this Court’s constitutional au-\nthority; gravely distorted the Nation’s understanding of\nthis Court’s proper constitutional role; and caused signifi-\ncant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State’s “im-\nportant and legitimate interest” in protecting fetal life. 410\nU.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n                        KAVANAUGH, J., concurring\n\nshould be overruled.3\n  But the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more\ncomplicated because of Casey. In 1992, 19 years after Roe,\nCasey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24\nweeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of\nabortion than Roe had allowed.4\n  I have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion. And I respect the Casey\nplurality’s good-faith effort to locate some middle ground or\ncompromise that could resolve this controversy for America.\n  But as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey’s\n——————\n   3 I also agree with the Court’s conclusion today with respect to reliance.\n\nBroad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe,\nbut the Court has not analyzed reliance in that way in the past. For\nexample, American businesses and workers relied on Lochner v. New\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children’s Hospital of D. C., 261\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\nsubstantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner.\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board\nof Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy. Much of\nAmerican society was built around the traditional view of marriage that\nwas upheld in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was re-\nflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless over-\nruled Baker.\n   4 As the Court today notes, Casey’s approach to stare decisis pointed in\n\ntwo directions. Casey reaffirmed Roe’s viability line, but it expressly\noverruled the Roe trimester framework and also expressly overruled two\nlandmark post-Roe abortion cases—Akron v. Akron Center for Reproduc-\ntive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American Col-\nlege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986). See Casey,\n505 U. S., at 870, 872−873, 878−879, 882. Casey itself thus directly con-\ntradicts any notion of absolute stare decisis in abortion cases.\n"

In recent years, a sig-\nnificant number of States have enacted abortion re-\nstrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those\nnumerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who con-\ntinue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24\nweeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the\nState’s “important and legitimate interest” in protecting fe-\ntal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority\nof the States—26 in all—ask the Court to overrule Roe and\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.\n   In short, Casey’s stare decisis analysis rested in part on a\npredictive judgment about the future development of state\nlaws and of the people’s views on the abortion issue. But\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years con-\nflicts with Casey’s predictive judgment and therefore under-\nmines Casey’s precedential force.5\n   In any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare de-\ncisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe can-\nnot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare de-\ncisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this\nCourt had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and up-\nheld the States’ authority to segregate people on the basis\nof race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in\n——————\n  5 To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for over-\n\nruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to\noverrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Court’s traditional\nstare decisis factors. The only point here is that Casey adopted a special\nstare decisis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving\nthe national controversy and ending the national division over abortion.\nThe continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws\nand positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey on its\nown terms.\n"

That issue will be re-\nsolved by the people and their representatives in the demo-\ncratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties’\narguments have raised other related questions, and I ad-\ndress some of them here.\n   First is the question of how this decision will affect other\nprecedents involving issues such as contraception and mar-\nriage—in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecti-\ncut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438\n(1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Oberge-\nfell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the\nCourt today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the over-\nruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast\ndoubt on those precedents.\n   Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related le-\ngal questions raised by today’s decision are not especially\ndifficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a\nState bar a resident of that State from traveling to another\nState to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no\nbased on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May\na State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an\nabortion that occurred before today’s decision takes effect?\nIn my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process\nClause or the Ex Post Facto Clause.

That question is directly\nimplicated here: Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, Miss.\nCode Ann. §41–41–191 (2018), generally prohibits abortion\nafter the fifteenth week of pregnancy—several weeks before\na fetus is regarded as “viable” outside the womb. In urging\nour review, Mississippi stated that its case was “an ideal\nvehicle” to “reconsider the bright-line viability rule,” and\nthat a judgment in its favor would “not require the Court to\noverturn” Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned\nParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833\n(1992). Pet. for Cert. 5.\n   Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by do-\ning just that. I would take a more measured course. I agree\nwith the Court that the viability line established by Roe and\nCasey should be discarded under a straightforward stare de-\ncisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abor-\ntion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman’s\nright to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right\nshould therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable\nopportunity to choose, but need not extend any further—\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
[137] "2   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\ncertainly not all the way to viability. Mississippi’s law al-\nlows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be-\nyond the point at which it is considered “late” to discover a\npregnancy. See A. Ayoola, Late Recognition of Unintended\nPregnancies, 32 Pub. Health Nursing 462 (2015) (preg-\nnancy is discoverable and ordinarily discovered by six\nweeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning\nthe adequacy of that opportunity.\n   But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple\nyet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not\nnecessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is nec-\nessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always per-\nfect in following that command, and certainly there are\ncases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of\nthem. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judi-\ncial restraint here, where the broader path the Court\nchooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have\nnot only previously recognized, but also expressly reaf-\nfirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court’s\nopinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues can-\nnot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and conse-\nquential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.\n                                I\n  Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the\nonly question we need decide here: whether to retain the\nrule from Roe and Casey that a woman’s right to terminate\nher pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is re-\ngarded as “viable” outside the womb. I agree that this rule\nshould be discarded.\n  First, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting via-\nbility as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to\nadvance its substantial interests in the area of abortion.\nSee ante, at 50–53. Roe set forth a rigid three-part frame-\nwork anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a\nregulatory code than a body of constitutional law.

No party or ami-\ncus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule.\nAnd as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule\nplayed only a de minimis role in the parties’ briefing and in\nthe oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17–18, 51 (fleeting\ndiscussion of the viability rule).\n   It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey\nmade a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the\ntime for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability.\nThe Court’s jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illus-\ntration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented\nnor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe’s defense of the\nline boiled down to the circular assertion that the State’s\ninterest is compelling only when an unborn child can live\noutside the womb, because that is when the unborn child\ncan live outside the womb. See 410 U. S., at 163–164; see\nalso J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe\nv. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roe’s reasoning “mis-\ntake[s] a definition for a syllogism”).\n   Twenty years later, the best defense of the viability line\nthe Casey plurality could conjure up was workability. See\n505 U. S., at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court)\n(discussing the difficulties in applying the viability stand-\nard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content\nby opining that “it might be said that a woman who fails to\nact before viability has consented to the State’s intervention\non behalf of the developing child,” Casey, 505 U. S., at 870,\nthat mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viabil-\nity as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent\nargument could be made with respect to a law banning\nabortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at\nwhich nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant,\nA.

J., concurring in judgment\n\nof Pregnancy Recognition and Prenatal Care Use: A Popu-\nlation-based Study in the United States 39 (2010) (Preg-\nnancy Recognition). The dissent, which would retain the\nviability line, offers no justification for it either.\n   This Court’s jurisprudence since Casey, moreover, has\n“eroded” the “underpinnings” of the viability line, such as\nthey were. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521\n(1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recog-\nnized only two state interests warranting regulation of\nabortion: maternal health and protection of “potential life.”\nRoe, 410 U. S., at 162–163. That changed with Gonzales v.\nCarhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a\nbroader array of interests, such as drawing “a bright line\nthat clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide,” main-\ntaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the\nmedical profession. Id., at 157–160. The viability line has\nnothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf.\nid., at 171 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales “blur[red]\nthe line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and\npostviability abortions”); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey,\nand the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276–279\n(2009).\n   Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of ju-\nrisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of preg-\nnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at\nthat stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code §26–23B–2\n(2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legiti-\nmate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no rea-\nson why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of\nsuch laws. The same is true of laws designed to “protect[ ]\nthe integrity and ethics of the medical profession” and re-\nstrict procedures likely to “coarsen society” to the “dignity\nof human life.” Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157. Mississippi’s\nlaw, for instance, was premised in part on the legislature’s\nfinding that the “dilation and evacuation” procedure is a\n“barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and\n"

That procedure accounts for most\nabortions performed after the first trimester—two weeks\nbefore the period at issue in this case—and “involve[s] the\nuse of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn\nchild apart.” Ibid.; see also Gonzales, 550 U.

It is indeed “telling that\nother countries almost uniformly eschew” a viability line.\nAnte, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of coun-\ntries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective\nabortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced\naround a 12–week line. See The World’s Abortion Laws,\nCenter for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online\nsource archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (Canada,\nChina, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Ko-\nrea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after\ntwenty weeks).

J., concurring in judgment\n\nentirely the right to choose whether to terminate a preg-\nnancy: “To be clear, the questions presented in this petition\ndo not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey.” Id., at\n5. Mississippi tempered that statement with an oblique\none-sentence footnote intimating that, if the Court could\nnot reconcile Roe and Casey with current facts or other\ncases, it “should not retain erroneous precedent.” Pet. for\nCert. 5–6, n. 1. But the State never argued that we should\ngrant review for that purpose.\n   After we granted certiorari, however, Mississippi\nchanged course. In its principal brief, the State bluntly an-\nnounced that the Court should overrule Roe and Casey. The\nConstitution does not protect a right to an abortion, it ar-\ngued, and a State should be able to prohibit elective abor-\ntions if a rational basis supports doing so. See Brief for Pe-\ntitioners 12–13.\n   The Court now rewards that gambit, noting three times\nthat the parties presented “no half-measures” and argued\nthat “we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey.”\nAnte, at 5, 8, 72. Given those two options, the majority picks\nthe latter.\n   This framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits,\nMississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply\nrejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its\nfavor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 38–48. But even if the\nState had not argued as much, it would not matter. There\nis no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of\ntheir case on a particular ground—let alone when review\nwas sought and granted on a different one.

S., at 450, we\nshould begin with the narrowest basis for disposition, pro-\nceeding to consider a broader one only if necessary to re-\nsolve the case at hand. See, e.g., Office of Personnel Man-\nagement v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 423 (1990). It is only\nwhere there is no valid narrower ground of decision that we\nshould go on to address a broader issue, such as whether a\nconstitutional decision should be overturned. See Federal\nElection Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S.\n449, 482 (2007) (declining to address the claim that a con-\nstitutional decision should be overruled when the appellant\nprevailed on its narrower constitutional argument).\n   Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly\nwithout overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: rec-\nognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the ma-\njority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to re-\nject any right to an abortion at all. See Webster v.\nReproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 518, 521\n(1989) (plurality opinion) (rejecting Roe’s viability line as\n“rigid” and “indeterminate,” while also finding “no occasion\nto revisit the holding of Roe” that, under the Constitution,\na State must provide an opportunity to choose to terminate\na pregnancy).\n   Of course, such an approach would not be available if the\nrationale of Roe and Casey was inextricably entangled with\nand dependent upon the viability standard. It is not. Our\nprecedents in this area ground the abortion right in a\nwoman’s “right to choose.” See Carey v. Population Services\nInt’l, 431 U.

If that is the basis for Roe,\nRoe’s viability line should be scrutinized from the same per-\nspective.

S.,\nat 860. Other cases of ours have repeated that language.\nSee, e.g., Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 145–146. But simply de-\nclaring it does not make it so. The question in Roe was\nwhether there was any right to abortion in the Constitu-\ntion. See Brief for Appellants and Brief for Appellees, in\nRoe v. Wade, O. T. 1971, No. 70–18. How far the right ex-\ntended was a concern that was separate and subsidiary,\nand—not surprisingly—entirely unbriefed.\n   The Court in Roe just chose to address both issues in one\nopinion: It first recognized a right to “choose to terminate\n[a] pregnancy” under the Constitution, see 410 U. S., at\n129–159, and then, having done so, explained that a line\nshould be drawn at viability such that a State could not pro-\nscribe abortion before that period, see id., at 163. The via-\nbility line is a separate rule fleshing out the metes and\nbounds of Roe’s core holding.

J., concurring in judgment\n\nrule—from our jurisprudence.\n   The majority lists a number of cases that have stressed\nthe importance of the viability rule to our abortion prece-\ndents. See ante, at 73–74. I agree that—whether it was\noriginally holding or dictum—the viability line is clearly\npart of our “past precedent,” and the Court has applied it as\nsuch in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is\nthat Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law:\none, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a\npregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the\nState’s legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside\nthe womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former.\nI would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this\ncase to consider the basic right.\n   The Court contends that it is impossible to address Roe’s\nconclusion that the Constitution protects the woman’s right\nto abortion, without also addressing Roe’s rule that the\nState’s interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify\na ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have\npartially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Miller, 471 U. S. 130, 142–144 (1985); Daniels v.\nWilliams, 474 U. S. 327, 328–331 (1986); Batson v. Ken-\ntucky, 476 U. S. 79, 90–93 (1986), and certainly have never\nheld that a distinct holding defining the contours of a con-\nstitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the\nright itself.\n   Overruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this\ncase in Mississippi’s favor. The law at issue allows abor-\ntions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate op-\nportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a\npregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy is\nwell into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now in-\nexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers\nshe is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum\n&amp; K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness\nAmong US Women, 21 Maternal &amp; Child Health J. 715, 722\n"

Almost all know by the end of the first trimester.\nPregnancy Recognition 39. Safe and effective abortifa-\ncients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly\nduring those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22\nGeo. J. Gender &amp; L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no\nsurprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the\nfirst trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Abortion Surveillance—United States 1 (2020).\nPresumably most of the remainder would also take place\nearlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample ev-\nidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient\ntime, absent rare circumstances, for a woman “to decide for\nherself ” whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492\nU. S., at 520 (plurality opinion).*\n                              III\n   Whether a precedent should be overruled is a question\n“entirely within the discretion of the court.” Hertz v.

In my respectful view, the sound exercise of that dis-\ncretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the\nnarrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling\nRoe and Casey entirely. The Court says there is no “princi-\npled basis” for this approach, ante, at 73, but in fact it is\nfirmly grounded in basic principles of stare decisis and judi-\ncial restraint.\n\n——————\n  *The majority contends that “nothing like [my approach] was recom-\nmended by either party.” Ante, at 72.

J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Court’s decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a seri-\nous jolt to the legal system—regardless of how you view\nthose cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided\nviability line would be markedly less unsettling, and noth-\ning more is needed to decide this case.\n   Our cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on\nreliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether\nto take such a step, and respondents argue that generations\nof women have relied on the right to an abortion in organ-\nizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief\nfor Respondents 36–41; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 856\n(making the same point). The Court questions whether\nthese concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see\nante, at 64–65, but the issue would not even arise with a\ndecision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasona-\nbly be argued that women have shaped their lives in part\non the assumption that they would be able to abort up to\nviability, as opposed to fifteen weeks.\n   In support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal\nconstitutional decisions that involved overruling prior prec-\nedents: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954),\nWest Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943),\nand West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937).\nSee ante, at 40–41. The opinion in Brown was unanimous\nand eleven pages long; this one is neither. Barnette was\ndecided only three years after the decision it overruled,\nthree Justices having had second thoughts.

[147] "12   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Court says we should consider whether to overrule\nRoe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced\nto consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76–\n77. There would be “turmoil” until we did so, according to\nthe Court, because of existing state laws with “shorter\ndeadlines or no deadline at all.” Ante, at 76. But under the\nnarrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing\nabortion altogether would still violate binding precedent.\nAnd to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date\nearlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that\ntimeframe would proceed free of the distorting effect that\nthe viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The\nsame could be true, for that matter, with respect to legisla-\ntive consideration in the States. We would then be free to\nexercise our discretion in deciding whether and when to\ntake up the issue, from a more informed perspective.\n                         *      *    *\n   Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relent-\nless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot\nshare. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminat-\ning a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be\ntreated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fif-\nteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once coun-\nseled that the difficulty of a question “admonishes us to ob-\nserve the wise limitations on our function and to confine\nourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposi-\ntion of the immediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central\nR. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372–373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for\nthe Court). I would decide the question we granted review\nto answer—whether the previously recognized abortion\nright bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such\nthat a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is\nnecessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no,\nand there is no need to go further to decide this case.\n   I therefore concur only in the judgment.\n"

Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S.\n833 (1992), have protected the liberty and equality of\nwomen. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitu-\ntion safeguards a woman’s right to decide for herself\nwhether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed,\nthat in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could\nnot make that choice for women. The government could not\ncontrol a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It\ncould not determine what the woman’s future would be. See\nCasey, 505 U. S., at 853; Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124,\n171–172 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Respecting a\nwoman as an autonomous being, and granting her full\nequality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most\npersonal and most consequential of all life decisions.\n   Roe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisive-\nness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans\nhold profoundly different views about the “moral[ity]” of\n“terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage.” Ca-\nsey, 505 U. S., at 850.

[149] "2   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n          BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\n\nState has legitimate interests from the outset of the preg-\nnancy in protecting” the “life of the fetus that may become\na child.” Id., at 846. So the Court struck a balance, as it\noften does when values and goals compete. It held that the\nState could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long\nas the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman’s life\nor health. It held that even before viability, the State could\nregulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful\nways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court\nheld, a State could not impose a “substantial obstacle” on a\nwoman’s “right to elect the procedure” as she (not the gov-\nernment) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances\nand complexities of her own life. Ibid.\n   Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from\nthe very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to\nspeak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term,\neven at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abor-\ntion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever\nrational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And\nbecause, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life\nis rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of re-\nstrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions\nafter the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority’s rul-\ning, though, another State’s law could do so after ten weeks,\nor five or three or one—or, again, from the moment of ferti-\nlization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipa-\ntion of today’s ruling. More will follow. Some States have\nenacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure,\nincluding taking medication in one’s own home. They have\npassed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is\nthe victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman\nwill have to bear her rapist’s child or a young girl her fa-\nther’s—no matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too,\nafter today’s ruling, some States may compel women to\ncarry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies—for\nexample, one afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die\n"

States may even argue that a\nprohibition on abortion need make no provision for protect-\ning a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a\nvast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose\nits moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to\na child.\n   Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also\nbe left largely to the States’ devices. A State can of course\nimpose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including\nlengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop\nthere. Perhaps, in the wake of today’s decision, a state law\nwill criminalize the woman’s conduct too, incarcerating or\nfining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion. And as\nTexas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor\nagainst neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to\nroot out anyone who tries to get an abortion, or to assist\nanother in doing so.\n   The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive\neffects of its holding. Today’s decision, the majority says,\npermits “each State” to address abortion as it pleases. Ante,\nat 79. That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman\nwho cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a pro-\ncedure. Above all others, women lacking financial re-\nsources will suffer from today’s decision. In any event, in-\nterstate restrictions will also soon be in the offing. After\nthis decision, some States may block women from traveling\nout of State to obtain abortions, or even from receiving abor-\ntion medications from out of State.

Ante,\nat 4 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring).\n   Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result\nof today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s\nrights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yes-\nterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman con-\nfronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reason-\nable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a\nchild, with all the life-transforming consequences that act\ninvolves. And in thus safeguarding each woman’s reproduc-\ntive freedom, the Constitution also protected “[t]he ability\nof women to participate equally in [this Nation’s] economic\nand social life.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 856. But no longer. As\nof today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman\nto give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A\nState can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is\na wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare.\nSome women, especially women of means, will find ways\naround the State’s assertion of power. Others—those with-\nout money or childcare or the ability to take time off from\nwork—will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an un-\nsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even\ndie. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child,\nbut at significant personal or familial cost. At the least,\nthey will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The\nConstitution will, today’s majority holds, provide no shield,\ndespite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.\n   And no one should be confident that this majority is done\nwith its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not\nstand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for\ndecades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity,\nfamilial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the\nright to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the\nright to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405\nU. S. 438 (1972).

Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\nU. S. 644 (2015). They are all part of the same constitu-\ntional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over\nthe most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be\nmore accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that noth-\ning it does “cast[s] doubt on precedents that do not concern\nabortion.” Ante, at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring)\n(advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence, and\nObergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for\nwhat the majority does today is that the right to elect an\nabortion is not “deeply rooted in history”: Not until Roe, the\nmajority argues, did people think abortion fell within the\nConstitution’s guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 32. The same\ncould be said, though, of most of the rights the majority\nclaims it is not tampering with. The majority could write\njust as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the\nmid-20th century, “there was no support in American law\nfor a constitutional right to obtain [contraceptives].” Ante,\nat 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the major-\nity does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does,\nall rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-\n19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority’s\nopinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are\nunder threat. It is one or the other.\n    One piece of evidence on that score seems especially sa-\nlient: The majority’s cavalier approach to overturning this\nCourt’s precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a\nfoundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided\nshould stay decided unless there is a very good reason for\nchange. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility.\nThose qualities are not evident in today’s opinion. The ma-\njority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society\nit sets off.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n          BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\n\non the availability of abortion both in structuring their re-\nlationships and in planning their lives. The legal frame-\nwork Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing in-\nterests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across\nthe country. No recent developments, in either law or fact,\nhave eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in\nshort, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already\nfound all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about prec-\nedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in sup-\nport of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not\nwarranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason\nand one reason only: because the composition of this Court\nhas changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, “con-\ntributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial\nprocess” by ensuring that decisions are “founded in the law\nrather than in the proclivities of individuals.” Payne v. Ten-\nnessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474\nU. S. 254, 265 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals\nrule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and\nimpartially apply the law. We dissent.\n                              I\n   We start with Roe and Casey, and with their deep connec-\ntions to a broad swath of this Court’s precedents. To hear\nthe majority tell the tale, Roe and Casey are aberrations:\nThey came from nowhere, went nowhere—and so are easy\nto excise from this Nation’s constitutional law. That is not\ntrue. After describing the decisions themselves, we explain\nhow they are rooted in—and themselves led to—other\nrights giving individuals control over their bodies and their\nmost personal and intimate associations. The majority does\nnot wish to talk about these matters for obvious reasons; to\ndo so would both ground Roe and Casey in this Court’s prec-\nedents and reveal the broad implications of today’s decision.\nBut the facts will not so handily disappear.

A State could not, “by adopt-\ning one theory of life,” override all “rights of the pregnant\nwoman.” Id., at 162.\n  At the same time, though, the Court recognized “valid in-\nterest[s]” of the State “in regulating the abortion decision.”\nId., at 153. The Court noted in particular “important inter-\nests” in “protecting potential life,” “maintaining medical\nstandards,” and “safeguarding [the] health” of the woman.\nId., at 154. No “absolut[ist]” account of the woman’s right\ncould wipe away those significant state claims. Ibid.\n  The Court therefore struck a balance, turning on the\nstage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur.\nThe Court explained that early on, a woman’s choice must\nprevail, but that “at some point the state interests” become\n“dominant.” Id., at 155. It then set some guideposts. In\nthe first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not inter-\nfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At\nany time after that point, the State could regulate to protect\nthe pregnant woman’s health, such as by insisting that\nabortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements.\nAnd after the fetus’s viability—the point when the fetus\n“has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s\nwomb”—the State could ban abortions, except when neces-\nsary to preserve the woman’s life or health. Id., at 163–164.\n  In the 20 years between Roe and Casey, the Court ex-\npressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on\nmany more. Recognizing that “arguments [against Roe]\ncontinue to be made,” we responded that the doctrine of\nstare decisis “demands respect in a society governed by the\nrule of law.” Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive\nHealth, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 419–420 (1983).

Casey is in signifi-\ncant measure a precedent about the doctrine of precedent—\nuntil today, one of the Court’s most important. But we\nleave for later that aspect of the Court’s decision. The key\nthing now is the substantive aspect of the Court’s consid-\nered conclusion that “the essential holding of Roe v. Wade\nshould be retained and once again reaffirmed.” 505 U. S.,\nat 846.\n   Central to that conclusion was a full-throated restate-\nment of a woman’s right to choose. Like Roe, Casey\ngrounded that right in the Fourteenth Amendment’s guar-\nantee of “liberty.” That guarantee encompasses realms of\nconduct not specifically referenced in the Constitution:\n“Marriage is mentioned nowhere” in that document, yet the\nCourt was “no doubt correct” to protect the freedom to\nmarry “against state interference.” 505 U. S., at 847–848.\nAnd the guarantee of liberty encompasses conduct today\nthat was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. See id., at 848. “It is settled now,” the Court\nsaid—though it was not always so—that “the Constitution\nplaces limits on a State’s right to interfere with a person’s\nmost basic decisions about family and parenthood, as well\nas bodily integrity.” Id., at 849 (citations omitted); see id.,\nat 851 (similarly describing the constitutional protection\ngiven to “personal decisions relating to marriage, procrea-\ntion, contraception, [and] family relationships”).

Ibid.; see id., at 852–853. In those\ncases, the Court had recognized “the right of the individual”\nto make the vastly consequential “decision whether to bear”\na child. Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey rea-\nsoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman\nconfronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about\nabortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to\nchart her life’s course. See id., at 853.\n   In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took\nfull account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the\nimportance of various competing state interests. Some\nAmericans, the Court stated, “deem [abortion] nothing\nshort of an act of violence against innocent human life.” 505\nU. S., at 852. And each State has an interest in “the protec-\ntion of potential life”—as Roe itself had recognized. 505\nU. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that in-\nterest was not conclusive. The State could not “resolve” the\n“moral and spiritual” questions raised by abortion in “such\na definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the mat-\nter.” Id., at 850 (majority opinion). It could not force her to\nbear the “pain” and “physical constraints” of “carr[ying] a\nchild to full term” when she would have chosen an early\nabortion. Id., at 852. But on the other hand, the State had,\nas Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in dis-\nallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And\nit had an ever-present interest in “ensur[ing] that the\nwoman’s choice is informed” and in presenting the case for\n“choos[ing] childbirth over abortion.” 505 U. S., at 878 (plu-\nrality opinion).\n   So Casey again struck a balance, differing from Roe’s in\nonly incremental ways. It retained Roe’s “central holding”\nthat the State could bar abortion only after viability. 505\nU. S., at 860 (majority opinion).

If the woman even by then\nhad not acted, she lacked adequate grounds to object to “the\nState’s intervention on [the developing child’s] behalf.”\nIbid. At the same time, Casey decided, based on two dec-\nades of experience, that the Roe framework did not give\nStates sufficient ability to regulate abortion prior to viabil-\nity. In that period, Casey now made clear, the State could\nregulate not only to protect the woman’s health but also to\n“promot[e] prenatal life.” 505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opin-\nion). In particular, the State could ensure informed choice\nand could try to promote childbirth. See id., at 877–878.\nBut the State still could not place an “undue burden”—or\n“substantial obstacle”—“in the path of a woman seeking an\nabortion.” Id., at 878. Prior to viability, the woman, con-\nsistent with the constitutional “meaning of liberty,” must\n“retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body.”\nId., at 869.\n   We make one initial point about this analysis in light of\nthe majority’s insistence that Roe and Casey, and we in de-\nfending them, are dismissive of a “State’s interest in pro-\ntecting prenatal life.” Ante, at 38.

Ante, at 38. To the\nmajority “balance” is a dirty word, as moderation is a for-\neign concept. The majority would allow States to ban abor-\ntion from conception onward because it does not think\nforced childbirth at all implicates a woman’s rights to equal-\nity and freedom. Today’s Court, that is, does not think\nthere is anything of constitutional significance attached to\na woman’s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe\nand Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some\nsense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our prec-\nedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime\nwe have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing\ninterests, and sought a balance between them. The consti-\ntutional regime we enter today erases the woman’s interest\nand recognizes only the State’s (or the Federal Govern-\nment’s).\n                              B\n   The majority makes this change based on a single ques-\ntion: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey\n\n——————\nof any significance.” Ante, at 38. To the contrary. The liberty interests\nunderlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra,\nat 22–24. But only in the sphere of abortion is the state interest in pro-\ntecting potential life involved. So only in that sphere, as both Roe and\nCasey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (bar-\nring abortion after viability and discouraging it before). The majority’s\nfailure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of\nthe idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional\ncontext. Cf.

The majority says (and with this\nmuch we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In\n1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy,\nand no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided\none.\n  Of course, the majority opinion refers as well to some\nlater and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes\nback as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. See ante, at 17.\nBut that turns out to be wheel-spinning. First, it is not\nclear what relevance such early history should have, even\nto the majority. See New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn.,\nInc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 26) (“His-\ntorical evidence that long predates [ratification] may not il-\nluminate the scope of the right”). If the early history obvi-\nously supported abortion rights, the majority would no\ndoubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment’s ratifiers are germane. See ibid. (It is “better not to\ngo too far back into antiquity,” except if olden “law survived\nto become our Founders’ law”). Second—and embarrass-\ningly for the majority—early law in fact does provide some\nsupport for abortion rights. Common-law authorities did\nnot treat abortion as a crime before “quickening”—the point\nwhen the fetus moved in the womb.2 And early American\nlaw followed the common-law rule.3 So the criminal law of\nthat early time might be taken as roughly consonant with\n\n——————\n   2 See, e.g., 1 W.

Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other\nside of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many\nStates barred abortion up to the time of Roe. See ante, at\n24, 36. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window\ndressing.

Had the pre-Roe liberalization of abor-\ntion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the\n20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only\nthe ratifiers’ views are germane.\n   The majority’s core legal postulate, then, is that we in the\n21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as\nits ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority em-\nphasizes over and over again. See ante, at 47 (“[T]he most\nimportant historical fact [is] how the States regulated abor-\ntion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted”); see\nalso ante, at 5, 16, and n. 24, 23, 25, 28. If the ratifiers did\nnot understand something as central to freedom, then nei-\nther can we. Or said more particularly: If those people did\nnot understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee\nof liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then\nthose rights do not exist.\n   As an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding\nsentence. We referred there to the “people” who ratified the\nFourteenth Amendment: What rights did those “people”\nhave in their heads at the time? But, of course, “people” did\nnot ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is\nperhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not per-\nfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for\nwomen’s liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal\nmembers of our Nation.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n          BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\n\nnow, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868?\nHow is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination\nagainst them to heightened judicial scrutiny? How is it that\nour Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment’s lib-\nerty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not le-\ngally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for them-\nselves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that\nuntil today, that same constitutional clause protected a\nwoman’s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a\npregnancy in its earlier stages?\n   The answer is that this Court has rejected the majority’s\npinched view of how to read our Constitution. “The Found-\ners,” we recently wrote, “knew they were writing a docu-\nment designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances\nover centuries.” NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513,\n533–534 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice\nJohn Marshall, our Constitution is “intended to endure for\nages to come,” and must adapt itself to a future “seen\ndimly,” if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415\n(1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it\nis. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that\nthe world changes. So they did not define rights by refer-\nence to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead,\nthe Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit fu-\nture evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the\ncourse of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers’\ninvitation. It has kept true to the Framers’ principles by\napplying them in new ways, responsive to new societal un-\nderstandings and conditions.\n   Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in\nconstruing the majestic but open-ended words of the Four-\nteenth Amendment—the guarantees of “liberty” and\n“equality” for all. And nowhere has that approach produced\nprouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider\nan example Obergefell used a few years ago.

Glucks-\nberg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997), that the Fourteenth Amendment\n“must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with cen-\ntral reference to specific historical practices”—exactly the\nview today’s majority follows. Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 671.\nAnd the Court specifically rejected that view.4 In doing so,\nthe Court reflected on what the proposed, historically cir-\ncumscribed approach would have meant for interracial\nmarriage. See ibid. The Fourteenth Amendment’s ratifiers\ndid not think it gave black and white people a right to marry\neach other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice\ndeemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the\nCourt in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), read the\nFourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings’ union. If,\nObergefell explained, “rights were defined by who exercised\nthem in the past, then received practices could serve as\ntheir own continued justification”—even when they conflict\nwith “liberty” and “equality” as later and more broadly un-\nderstood. 576 U. S., at 671. The Constitution does not\nfreeze for all time the original view of what those rights\nguarantee, or how they apply.\n  That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes\npeople to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the\noriginal applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no\nothers, or (2) surrender to judges’ “own ardent views,” un-\ngrounded in law, about the “liberty that Americans should\nenjoy.” Ante, at 14. At least, that idea is what the majority\nsometimes tries to convey. At other times, the majority (or,\nrather, most of it) tries to assure the public that it has no\ndesigns on rights (for example, to contraception) that arose\nonly in the back half of the 20th century—in other words,\n——————\n  4 The majority ignores that rejection. See ante, at 5, 13, 36. But it is\n\nunequivocal: The Glucksberg test, Obergefell said, “may have been ap-\npropriate” in considering physician-assisted suicide, but “is inconsistent\nwith the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental\nrights, including marriage and intimacy.” 576 U. S., at 671.\n"

The second\nJustice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance\nwhen he explained why he would have invalidated a State’s\nban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not “free to\nroam where unguided speculation might take them.” Poe v.\nUllman, 367 U. S. 497, 542 (1961) (dissenting opinion). Yet\nthey also must recognize that the constitutional “tradition”\nof this country is not captured whole at a single moment.\nIbid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long\nsweep of our history and from successive judicial prece-\ndents—each looking to the last and each seeking to apply\nthe Constitution’s most fundamental commitments to new\nconditions. That is why Americans, to go back to Oberge-\nfell’s example, have a right to marry across racial lines.\nAnd it is why, to go back to Justice Harlan’s case, Ameri-\ncans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose\nfor themselves whether to have children.\n   All that is what Casey understood. Casey explicitly re-\njected the present majority’s method. “[T]he specific prac-\ntices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment,” Casey stated, do not “mark[ ] the outer limits\nof the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth\nAmendment protects.” 505 U.

Because the Court has\n“vindicated [the] principle” over and over that (no matter\nthe sentiment in 1868) “there is a realm of personal liberty\nwhich the government may not enter”—especially relating\nto “bodily integrity” and “family life.” Id., at 847, 849, 851.\nCasey described in detail the Court’s contraception cases.\nSee id., at 848–849, 851–853. It noted decisions protecting\nthe right to marry, including to someone of another race.\nSee id., at 847–848 (“[I]nterracial marriage was illegal in\nmost States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt\ncorrect in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected\nagainst state interference”). In reviewing decades and dec-\nades of constitutional law, Casey could draw but one conclu-\nsion: Whatever was true in 1868, “[i]t is settled now, as it\nwas when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that\nthe Constitution places limits on a State’s right to interfere\nwith a person’s most basic decisions about family and\nparenthood.” Id., at 849.\n   And that conclusion still held good, until the Court’s in-\ntervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at\nthe time of Casey, and settled yesterday that the Constitu-\ntion places limits on a State’s power to assert control over\nan individual’s body and most personal decisionmaking. A\nmultitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roe’s\nrecognition and Casey’s reaffirmation of the right to choose;\nand Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections\nfor intimate and familial relations. The majority has em-\n\n——————\ntime of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes its recognition as a consti-\ntutional right? Ante, at 33. It has. And indeed, it has given no other\nreason for overruling Roe and Casey. Ante, at 15–16. We are not min-\ndreaders, but here is our best guess as to what the majority means.

It (liter-\nally) rattles them off in a single paragraph; and it implies\nthat they have nothing to do with each other, or with the\nright to terminate an early pregnancy. See ante, at 31–32\n(asserting that recognizing a relationship among them, as\naddressing aspects of personal autonomy, would inelucta-\nbly “license fundamental rights” to illegal “drug use [and]\nprostitution”). But that is flat wrong. The Court’s prece-\ndents about bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations,\nand procreation are all interwoven—all part of the fabric of\nour constitutional law, and because that is so, of our lives.\nEspecially women’s lives, where they safeguard a right to\nself-determination.\n   And eliminating that right, we need to say before further\ndescribing our precedents, is not taking a “neutral” posi-\ntion, as JUSTICE KAVANAUGH tries to argue. Ante, at 2–3,\n5, 7, 11–12 (concurring opinion). His idea is that neutrality\nlies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some\ncan go one way and some another. But would he say that\nthe Court is being “scrupulously neutral” if it allowed New\nYork and California to ban all the guns they want? Ante, at\n3. If the Court allowed some States to use unanimous juries\nand others not? If the Court told the States: Decide for\nyourselves whether to put restrictions on church attend-\nance? We could go on—and in fact we will. Suppose\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority\nopinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or\nhistorically grounded than the right to choose. What, then,\nof the right to contraception or same-sex marriage? Would\nit be “scrupulously neutral” for the Court to eliminate those\nrights too? The point of all these examples is that when it\ncomes to rights, the Court does not act “neutrally” when it\nleaves everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts\nneutrally when it protects the right against all comers. And\nto apply that point to the case here: When the Court deci-\nmates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is\n"

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by ap-\npropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness. His position\njust is what it is: A brook-no-compromise refusal to recog-\nnize a woman’s right to choose, from the first day of a preg-\nnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be\nsquared with this Court’s longstanding view that women\nindeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868)\nto make the most personal and consequential decisions\nabout their bodies and their lives.\n   Consider first, then, the line of this Court’s cases protect-\ning “bodily integrity.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 849. “No right,”\nin this Court’s time-honored view, “is held more sacred, or\nis more carefully guarded,” than “the right of every individ-\nual to the possession and control of his own person.” Union\nPacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see\nCruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269\n(1990) (Every adult “has a right to determine what shall be\ndone with his own body”). Or to put it more simply: Every-\none, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court\nhas restricted the power of government to interfere with a\nperson’s medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical\nprocedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470\nU. S. 753, 766–767 (1985) (forced surgery); Rochin v. Cali-\nfornia, 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173–174 (1952) (forced stomach\npumping); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 229, 236\n(1990) (forced administration of antipsychotic drugs).\n   Casey recognized the “doctrinal affinity” between those\nprecedents and Roe. 505 U. S., at 857. And that doctrinal\naffinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater\nincursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a\npregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experi-\nences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treat-\nments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and\n"

Just as one example, an American woman is\n14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term\nthan by having an abortion. See Whole Woman’s Health v.\nHellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 618 (2016). That women happily\nundergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord\ndoes not lessen how far a State impinges on a woman’s body\nwhen it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for\nsome women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically\nnecessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S., at 153. The ma-\njority does not say—which is itself ominous—whether a\nState may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion\nwhen she and her doctor have determined it is a needed\nmedical treatment.\n  So too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of deci-\nsions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of pri-\nvate choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate\nrelationships, and procreation. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 851,\n857; Roe, 410 U. S., at 152–153; see also ante, at 31–32 (list-\ning the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on).\nThose cases safeguard particular choices about whom to\nmarry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live\nwith; how to raise children—and crucially, whether and\nwhen to have children. In varied cases, the Court explained\nthat those choices—“the most intimate and personal” a per-\nson can make—reflect fundamental aspects of personal\nidentity; they define the very “attributes of personhood.”\nCasey, 505 U. S., at 851. And they inevitably shape the na-\nture and future course of a person’s life (and often the lives\nof those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices\nbelong to the individual, and not the government. That is\nthe essence of what liberty requires.\n  And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly\nsaid, even when those living in 1868 would not have recog-\nnized the claim—because they would not have seen the per-\nson making it as a full-fledged member of the community.\nThroughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has\n"

In\nthat way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality\ngo hand in hand; they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed\ncontainers the majority portrays. Compare Obergefell, 576\nU. S., at 672–675, with ante, at 10–11. So before Roe and\nCasey, the Court expanded in successive cases those who\ncould claim the right to marry—though their relationships\nwould have been outside the law’s protection in the mid-\n19th century. See, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (interracial cou-\nples); Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987) (prisoners); see\nalso, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651–652 (1972)\n(offering constitutional protection to untraditional “family\nunit[s]”). And after Roe and Casey, of course, the Court con-\ntinued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that the\nFourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the\nCourt resolved that the Amendment also conferred on\nsame-sex couples the right to marry. See Lawrence, 539\nU. S. 558; Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644. In considering that\nquestion, the Court held, “[h]istory and tradition,” espe-\ncially as reflected in the course of our precedent, “guide and\ndiscipline [the] inquiry.” Id., at 664. But the sentiments of\n1868 alone do not and cannot “rule the present.” Ibid.\n  Casey similarly recognized the need to extend the consti-\ntutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group.\nThe Court then understood, as the majority today does not,\nthat the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and\nwrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full\nand equal citizens.

Without the ability to decide whether and when\nto have children, women could not—in the way men took for\ngranted—determine how they would live their lives, and\nhow they would contribute to the society around them.\n   For much that reason, Casey made clear that the prece-\ndents Roe most closely tracked were those involving contra-\nception. Over the course of three cases, the Court had held\nthat a right to use and gain access to contraception was part\nof the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of liberty. See\nGriswold, 381 U. S. 479; Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438; Carey v.\nPopulation Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977). That clause,\nwe explained, necessarily conferred a right “to be free from\nunwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fun-\ndamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to\nbear or beget a child.” Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453; see\nCarey, 431 U. S., at 684–685. Casey saw Roe as of a piece:\nIn “critical respects the abortion decision is of the same\ncharacter.” 505 U. S., at 852. “[R]easonable people,” the\nCourt noted, could also oppose contraception; and indeed,\nthey could believe that “some forms of contraception” simi-\nlarly implicate a concern with “potential life.” Id., at 853,\n859. Yet the views of others could not automatically prevail\nagainst a woman’s right to control her own body and make\nher own choice about whether to bear, and probably to\nraise, a child. When an unplanned pregnancy is involved—\nbecause either contraception or abortion is outlawed—“the\nliberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the\nhuman condition.” Id., at 852. No State could undertake to\nresolve the moral questions raised “in such a definitive\nway” as to deprive a woman of all choice. Id., at 850.\n   Faced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and\njudicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights,\n"

It can (so it says)\nneatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional\nedifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of\nsomeone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not\ncollapse.) Today’s decision, the majority first says, “does\nnot undermine” the decisions cited by Roe and Casey—the\nones involving “marriage, procreation, contraception, [and]\nfamily relationships”—“in any way.” Ante, at 32; Casey, 505\nU. S., at 851. Note that this first assurance does not extend\nto rights recognized after Roe and Casey, and partly based\non them—in particular, rights to same-sex intimacy and\nmarriage. See supra, at 23.6 On its later tries, though, the\nmajority includes those too: “Nothing in this opinion should\nbe understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not con-\ncern abortion.” Ante, at 66; see ante, at 71–72. That right\nis unique, the majority asserts, “because [abortion] termi-\nnates life or potential life.” Ante, at 66 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see ante, at 32, 71–72. So the majority de-\npicts today’s decision as “a restricted railroad ticket, good\nfor this day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S.\n649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). Should the audi-\nence for these too-much-repeated protestations be duly sat-\nisfied? We think not.\n   The first problem with the majority’s account comes from\nJUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence—which makes clear he is\nnot with the program. In saying that nothing in today’s\nopinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, JUSTICE\nTHOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue\n——————\n   6 And note, too, that the author of the majority opinion recently joined\n\na statement, written by another member of the majority, lamenting that\nObergefell deprived States of the ability “to resolve th[e] question [of\nsame-sex marriage] through legislation.” Davis v. Ermold, 592 U. S. ___,\n___ (2020) (statement of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 1). That might sound\nfamiliar. Cf. ante, at 44 (lamenting that Roe “short-circuited the demo-\ncratic process”). And those two Justices hardly seemed content to let the\nmatter rest: The Court, they said, had “created a problem that only it can\nfix.” Davis, 592 U.

See ante, at 7 (“[T]his case does not pre-\nsent the opportunity to reject” those precedents). But he\nlets us know what he wants to do when they are. “[I]n fu-\nture cases,” he says, “we should reconsider all of this Court’s\nsubstantive due process precedents, including Griswold,\nLawrence, and Obergefell.” Ante, at 3; see also supra, at 25,\nand n. 6. And when we reconsider them? Then “we have a\nduty” to “overrul[e] these demonstrably erroneous deci-\nsions.” Ante, at 3. So at least one Justice is planning to use\nthe ticket of today’s decision again and again and again.\n   Even placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance\nin today’s opinion still does not work. Or at least that is so\nif the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturn-\ning Roe and Casey: the legal status of abortion in the 19th\ncentury. Except in the places quoted above, the state inter-\nest in protecting fetal life plays no part in the majority’s\nanalysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not\nexpressing a view “about the status of the fetus.” Ante, at\n65; see ante, at 32 (aligning itself with Roe’s and Casey’s\nstance of not deciding whether life or potential life is in-\nvolved); ante, at 38–39 (similar). The majority’s departure\nfrom Roe and Casey rests instead—and only—on whether a\nwoman’s decision to end a pregnancy involves any Four-\nteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and\nCasey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).7\n——————\n   7 Indulge a few more words about this point. The majority had a choice\n\nof two different ways to overrule Roe and Casey. It could claim that those\ncases underrated the State’s interest in fetal life. Or it could claim that\nthey overrated a woman’s constitutional liberty interest in choosing an\nabortion. (Or both.) The majority here rejects the first path, and we can\nsee why. Taking that route would have prevented the majority from\nclaiming that it means only to leave this issue to the democratic pro-\ncess—that it does not have a dog in the fight. See ante, at 38–39, 65.\nAnd indeed, doing so might have suggested a revolutionary proposition:\nthat the fetus is itself a constitutionally protected “person,” such that an\nabortion ban is constitutionally mandated. The majority therefore\nchooses the second path, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment does\n"

But here is the rub.\nThe law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a\nwealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recog-\nnized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and\nmarriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving\nto marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right rec-\nognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter,\nit did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Okla-\nhoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942), not to be ster-\nilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal\nanalysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those mat-\nters properly belong to the States too—whatever the partic-\nular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is im-\npossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle)\nhow the majority can say that its opinion today does not\nthreaten—does not even “undermine”—any number of\nother constitutional rights. Ante, at 32.8\n   Nor does it even help just to take the majority at its word.\nAssume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever rea-\nson, that it will go so far and no further. Scout’s honor.\nStill, the future significance of today’s opinion will be de-\ncided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving\n\n——————\nnot conceive of the abortion decision as implicating liberty, because the\nlaw in the 19th century gave that choice no protection. The trouble is\nthat the chosen path—which is, again, the solitary rationale for the\nCourt’s decision—provides no way to distinguish between the right to\nchoose an abortion and a range of other rights, including contraception.\n  8 The majority briefly (very briefly) gestures at the idea that some stare\n\ndecisis factors might play out differently with respect to these other con-\nstitutional rights. But the majority gives no hint as to why. And the\nmajority’s (mis)treatment of stare decisis in this case provides little rea-\nson to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority’s\nredoing any other decision it considered egregiously wrong.

Rights can expand in that way. Dissenting\nin Lawrence, Justice Scalia explained why he took no com-\nfort in the Court’s statement that a decision recognizing the\nright to same-sex intimacy did “not involve” same-sex mar-\nriage. 539 U. S., at 604. That could be true, he wrote, “only\nif one entertains the belief that principle and logic have\nnothing to do with the decisions of this Court.” Id., at 605.\nScore one for the dissent, as a matter of prophecy. And logic\nand principle are not one-way ratchets. Rights can contract\nin the same way and for the same reason—because what-\never today’s majority might say, one thing really does lead\nto another. We fervently hope that does not happen be-\ncause of today’s decision. We hope that we will not join Jus-\ntice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot under-\nstand how anyone can be confident that today’s opinion will\nbe the last of its kind.\n   Consider, as our last word on this issue, contraception.\nThe Constitution, of course, does not mention that word.\nAnd there is no historical right to contraception, of the kind\nthe majority insists on. To the contrary, the American legal\nlandscape in the decades after the Civil War was littered\nwith bans on the sale of contraceptive devices. So again,\nthere seem to be two choices. See supra, at 5, 26–27. If the\nmajority is serious about its historical approach, then Gris-\nwold and its progeny are in the line of fire too. Or if it is\nnot serious, then . . . what is the basis of today’s decision?\nIf we had to guess, we suspect the prospects of this Court\napproving bans on contraception are low. But once again,\nthe future significance of today’s opinion will be decided in\nthe future. At the least, today’s opinion will fuel the fight\nto get contraception, and any other issues with a moral di-\nmension, out of the Fourteenth Amendment and into state\n"

As a matter of constitutional method, the\nmajority’s commitment to replicate in 2022 every view\nabout the meaning of liberty held in 1868 has precious little\nto recommend it. Our law in this constitutional sphere, as\nin most, has for decades upon decades proceeded differ-\nently. It has considered fundamental constitutional princi-\nples, the whole course of the Nation’s history and traditions,\nand the step-by-step evolution of the Court’s precedents. It\nis disciplined but not static. It relies on accumulated judg-\nments, not just the sentiments of one long-ago generation\nof men (who themselves believed, and drafted the Constitu-\ntion to reflect, that the world progresses). And by doing so,\nit includes those excluded from that olden conversation, ra-\nther than perpetuating its bounds.\n   As a matter of constitutional substance, the majority’s\nopinion has all the flaws its method would suggest. Be-\ncause laws in 1868 deprived women of any control over their\nbodies, the majority approves States doing so today. Be-\ncause those laws prevented women from charting the\ncourse of their own lives, the majority says States can do\nthe same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell\na pregnant woman—even in the first days of her preg-\nnancy—that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can\nonce more impose that command.

Black-\nstone called it the “established rule to abide by former prec-\nedents.” 1 Blackstone 69. Stare decisis “promotes the\nevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of le-\ngal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. It maintains a\nstability that allows people to order their lives under the\nlaw. See H. Hart &amp; A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic\nProblems in the Making and Application of Law 568–569\n(1994).\n   Stare decisis also “contributes to the integrity of our con-\nstitutional system of government” by ensuring that deci-\nsions “are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities\nof individuals.” Vasquez, 474 U. S., at 265. As Hamilton\nwrote: It “avoid[s] an arbitrary discretion in the courts.”\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Ham-\nilton). And as Blackstone said before him: It “keep[s] the\nscale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with\nevery new judge’s opinion.” 1 Blackstone 69. The “glory” of\nour legal system is that it “gives preference to precedent ra-\nther than . . . jurists.” H. Humble, Departure From Prece-\ndent, 19 Mich. L. Rev. 608, 614 (1921). That is why, the\nstory goes, Chief Justice John Marshall donned a plain\nblack robe when he swore the oath of office. That act per-\nsonified an American tradition.

But none does, as further described below and\nin the Appendix. See infra, at 61–66. In some, the Court\nonly partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the\nrest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare\ndecisis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found,\nfor example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined\nor made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change\nthat had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance be-\ncause the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The\nmajority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of\nchanged law or fact alone, although that is present in most\nof the cases. See ante, at 69.) None of those factors apply\nhere: Nothing—and in particular, no significant legal or fac-\ntual change—supports overturning a half-century of settled\nlaw giving women control over their reproductive lives.\n   First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey\nwere correct. In holding that a State could not “resolve” the\ndebate about abortion “in such a definitive way that a\nwoman lacks all choice in the matter,” the Court protected\nwomen’s liberty and women’s equality in a way comporting\nwith our Fourteenth Amendment precedents.

Contrary to the majority’s view, the legal sta-\ntus of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those\ndecisions. And the majority’s repeated refrain about\n“usurp[ing]” state legislatures’ “power to address” a pub-\nlicly contested question does not help it on the key issue\nhere. Ante, at 44; see ante, at 1. To repeat: The point of a\nright is to shield individual actions and decisions “from the\nvicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond\nthe reach of majorities and officials and to establish them\nas legal principles to be applied by the courts.” Barnette,\n319 U. S., at 638; supra, at 7. However divisive, a right is\nnot at the people’s mercy.\n   In any event “[w]hether or not we . . . agree” with a prior\nprecedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis—\nand the remaining “principles of stare decisis weigh heavily\nagainst overruling” Roe and Casey. Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). Casey itself applied those\nprinciples, in one of this Court’s most important precedents\nabout precedent. After assessing the traditional stare deci-\nsis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible—\nthat stare decisis operates powerfully here. It still does.\nThe standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly worka-\nble. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two\ndecisions. And tens of millions of American women have\nrelied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under\ntraditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no spe-\ncial justification for the harm it causes.\n   And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that\npoint. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual\nchanges that have occurred since Roe and Casey.

It does not. It makes radical change too easy and\ntoo fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new\njudges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one\nand only one reason: because it has always despised them,\nand now it has the votes to discard them. The majority\nthereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law.\n                              A\n   Contrary to the majority’s view, there is nothing unwork-\nable about Casey’s “undue burden” standard. Its primary\nfocus on whether a State has placed a “substantial obstacle”\non a woman seeking an abortion is “the sort of inquiry fa-\nmiliar to judges across a variety of contexts.” June Medical\nServices L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op.,\nat 6) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). And it has\ngiven rise to no more conflict in application than many\nstandards this Court and others unhesitatingly apply every\nday.\n   General standards, like the undue burden standard, are\nubiquitous in the law, and particularly in constitutional ad-\njudication. When called on to give effect to the Constitu-\ntion’s broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible\nstandards that can be applied case-by-case to a myriad of\nunforeseeable circumstances. See Dickerson, 530 U. S., at\n441 (“No court laying down a general rule can possibly fore-\nsee the various circumstances” in which it must apply). So,\nfor example, the Court asks about undue or substantial bur-\ndens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce. See,\ne.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s Freedom Club PAC v.\nBennett, 564 U. S. 721, 748 (2011); Burdick v. Takushi, 504\nU. S. 428, 433–434 (1992); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397\nU.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n           BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\n\nwork with daily in other legal spheres—like the “rule of rea-\nson” in antitrust law or the “arbitrary and capricious”\nstandard for agency decisionmaking. See Standard Oil Co.\nof N. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 62 (1911); Motor Vehi-\ncle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Au-\ntomobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 42–43 (1983). Applying gen-\neral standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, just\nwhat it means to do law.\n   And the undue burden standard has given rise to no un-\nusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagree-\nment among judges. Casey knew it would: That much “is to\nbe expected in the application of any legal standard which\nmust accommodate life’s complexity.” 505 U. S., at 878\n(plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be ex-\npected in the application of any legal standard. But the ma-\njority vastly overstates the divisions among judges applying\nthe standard. We count essentially two. THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical\nmajority about whether Casey called for weighing the ben-\nefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens. See 591\nU. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 6–7); ante, at 59, 60, and\nn. 53.10 We agree that the June Medical difference is a dif-\nference—but not one that would actually make a difference\nin the result of most cases (it did not in June Medical), and\nnot one incapable of resolution were it ever to matter. As\nfor lower courts, there is now a one-year-old, one-to-one Cir-\ncuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to\nstate laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal\nabnormality. See ante, at 61, and n. 57. That is about it,\nas far as we can see.11 And that is not much. This Court\n\n——————\n  10 Some lower courts then differed over which opinion in June Medical\n\nwas controlling—but that is a dispute not about the undue burden stand-\nard, but about the “Marks rule,” which tells courts how to determine the\nprecedential effects of a divided decision.\n  11 The rest of the majority’s supposed splits are, shall we say, unim-\n"

To borrow\nan old saying that might apply here: Not one or even a cou-\nple of swallows can make the majority’s summer.\n  Anyone concerned about workability should consider the\nmajority’s substitute standard. The majority says a law\nregulating or banning abortion “must be sustained if there\nis a rational basis on which the legislature could have\nthought that it would serve legitimate state interests.”\nAnte, at 77. And the majority lists interests like “respect\nfor and preservation of prenatal life,” “protection of mater-\nnal health,” elimination of certain “medical procedures,”\n“mitigation of fetal pain,” and others. Ante, at 78. This\nCourt will surely face critical questions about how that test\napplies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary\nto protect a woman’s life and health? And if so, exactly\nwhen? How much risk to a woman’s life can a State force\n——————\npressive. The majority says that lower courts have split over how to ap-\nply the undue burden standard to parental notification laws. See ante,\nat 60, and n. 54. But that is not so. The state law upheld had an exemp-\ntion for minors demonstrating adequate maturity, whereas the ones\nstruck down did not. Compare Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge v.\nCamblos, 155 F. 3d 352, 383–384 (CA4 1998), with Planned Parenthood\nof Ind. &amp; Ky., Inc. v. Adams, 937 F. 3d 973, 981 (CA7 2019), cert. granted,\njudgment vacated, 591 U. S. ___ (2020), and Planned Parenthood, Sioux\nFalls Clinic v. Miller, 63 F. 3d 1452, 1460 (CA8 1995). The majority says\nthere is a split about bans on certain types of abortion procedures. See\nante, at 61, and n. 55. But the one court to have separated itself on that\nissue did so based on a set of factual findings significantly different from\nthose in other cases. Compare Whole Woman’s Health v.

Williamson, 900 F. 3d 1310, 1322–1324 (CA11 2018).\nFinally, the majority says there is a split about whether an increase in\ntravel time to reach a clinic is an undue burden. See ante, at 61, and\nn. 56. But the cases to which the majority refers predate this Court’s\ndecision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.

The Constitution protects travel and speech and in-\nterstate commerce, so today’s ruling will give rise to a host\nof new constitutional questions. Far from removing the\nCourt from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court\nat the center of the coming “interjurisdictional abortion\nwars.” Id., at ___ (draft, at 1).\n   In short, the majority does not save judges from unwieldy\ntests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy. To\nthe contrary, it discards a known, workable, and predicta-\nble standard in favor of something novel and probably far\nmore complicated. It forces the Court to wade further into\nhotly contested issues, including moral and philosophical\nones, that the majority criticizes Roe and Casey for address-\ning.\n                              B\n   When overruling constitutional precedent, the Court has\nalmost always pointed to major legal or factual changes un-\ndermining a decision’s original basis. A review of the Ap-\npendix to this dissent proves the point. See infra, at 61–66.\nMost “successful proponent[s] of overruling precedent,” this\nCourt once said, have carried “the heavy burden of persuad-\ning the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate\nthat the values served by stare decisis yield in favor of a\ngreater objective.” Vasquez, 474 U.

(And as we will later discuss, the presence of that\ncontinuing division provides more of a reason to stick with,\nthan to jettison, existing precedent. See infra, at 55–57.)\nIn the end, the majority throws longstanding precedent to\nthe winds without showing that anything significant has\nchanged to justify its radical reshaping of the law. See ante,\nat 43.\n                              1\n   Subsequent legal developments have only reinforced Roe\nand Casey. The Court has continued to embrace all the de-\ncisions Roe and Casey cited, decisions which recognize a\nconstitutional right for an individual to make her own\nchoices about “intimate relationships, the family,” and con-\ntraception. Casey, 505 U. S., at 857. Roe and Casey have\nthemselves formed the legal foundation for subsequent de-\ncisions protecting these profoundly personal choices. As\ndiscussed earlier, the Court relied on Casey to hold that the\nFourteenth Amendment protects same-sex intimate rela-\ntionships. See Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 578; supra, at 23.\nThe Court later invoked the same set of precedents to ac-\ncord constitutional recognition to same-sex marriage. See\nObergefell, 576 U. S., at 665–666; supra, at 23. In sum, Roe\nand Casey are inextricably interwoven with decades of prec-\nedent about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nSee supra, at 21–24. While the majority might wish it oth-\nerwise, Roe and Casey are the very opposite of “ ‘obsolete\nconstitutional thinking.’ ” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203,\n236 (1997) (quoting Casey, 505 U.

For some women, pregnancy and child-\nbirth can mean life-altering physical ailments or even\ndeath. Today, as noted earlier, the risks of carrying a preg-\nnancy to term dwarf those of having an abortion. See supra,\nat 22. Experts estimate that a ban on abortions increases\nmaternal mortality by 21 percent, with white women facing\na 13 percent increase in maternal mortality while black\nwomen face a 33 percent increase.13 Pregnancy and child-\nbirth may also impose large-scale financial costs. The ma-\njority briefly refers to arguments about changes in laws re-\nlating to healthcare coverage, pregnancy discrimination,\nand family leave. See ante, at 33–34. Many women, how-\never, still do not have adequate healthcare coverage before\nand after pregnancy; and, even when insurance coverage is\navailable, healthcare services may be far away.14 Women\nalso continue to face pregnancy discrimination that inter-\nferes with their ability to earn a living.

We do not say that every\nState is Mississippi, and we are sure some have made gains\nsince Roe and Casey in providing support for women and\nchildren.

See Brief for 547 Deans 23–34.\n   The only notable change we can see since Roe and Casey\ncuts in favor of adhering to precedent: It is that American\nabortion law has become more and more aligned with other\nnations.

S. 525 (1923), and a whole line of cases be-\nginning with Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). Ad-\nkins had found a state minimum-wage law unconstitutional\nbecause, in the Court’s view, the law interfered with a con-\nstitutional right to contract. 261 U. S., at 554–555. But\nthen the Great Depression hit, bringing with it unparal-\nleled economic despair. The experience undermined—in\nfact, it disproved—Adkins’s assumption that a wholly un-\nregulated market could meet basic human needs. As Jus-\ntice Jackson (before becoming a Justice) wrote of that time:\n“The older world of laissez faire was recognized everywhere\noutside the Court to be dead.” The Struggle for Judicial Su-\npremacy 85 (1941). In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught\nup, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of\nexisting legal doctrine. See also ante, at 11 (ROBERTS, C. J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had\nworked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was “com-\nmon knowledge through the length and breadth of the\nland.” 300 U. S., at 399. The laissez-faire approach had led\nto “the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insuf-\nficient to meet the bare cost of living.” Ibid. And since Ad-\nkins was decided, the law had also changed. In several de-\ncisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of\nStates to implement economic policies designed to enhance\ntheir citizens’ economic well-being. See, e.g., Nebbia v. New\nYork, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); O’Gorman &amp; Young, Inc. v.\nHartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251 (1931). The state-\nments in those decisions, West Coast Hotel explained, were\n“impossible to reconcile” with Adkins. 300 U. S., at 398.\nThere was no escaping the need for Adkins to go.\n   Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Fergu-\nson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with its doctrine of “sepa-\nrate but equal.” By 1954, decades of Jim Crow had made\nclear what Plessy’s turn of phrase actually meant: “inher-\nent[ ] [in]equal[ity].” Brown, 347 U.

Whatever might have been thought in\nPlessy’s time, the Brown Court explained, both experience\nand “modern authority” showed the “detrimental effect[s]”\nof state-sanctioned segregation: It “affect[ed] [children’s]\nhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” 347\nU. S., at 494. By that point, too, the law had begun to re-\nflect that understanding. In a series of decisions, the Court\nhad held unconstitutional public graduate schools’ exclu-\nsion of black students. See, e.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S.\n629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 332\nU. S. 631 (1948) (per curiam); Missouri ex rel. Gaines v.\nCanada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938). The logic of those cases,\nBrown held, “appl[ied] with added force to children in grade\nand high schools.” 347 U. S., at 494. Changed facts and\nchanged law required Plessy’s end.\n   The majority says that in recognizing those changes, we\nare implicitly supporting the half-century interlude be-\ntween Plessy and Brown. See ante, at 70. That is not so.\nFirst, if the Brown Court had used the majority’s method of\nconstitutional construction, it might not ever have over-\nruled Plessy, whether 5 or 50 or 500 years later. Brown\nthought that whether the ratification-era history supported\ndesegregation was “[a]t best . . . inconclusive.” 347 U. S., at\n489. But even setting that aside, we are not saying that a\ndecision can never be overruled just because it is terribly\nwrong. Take West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S.\n624, which the majority also relies on. See ante, at 40–41,\n70. That overruling took place just three years after the\ninitial decision, before any notable reliance interests had\ndeveloped.

To take that action based on a new\nand bare majority’s declaration that two Courts got the re-\nsult egregiously wrong? And to justify that action by refer-\nence to Barnette? Or to Brown—a case in which the Chief\nJustice also wrote an (11-page) opinion in which the entire\nCourt could speak with one voice? These questions answer\nthemselves.\n   Casey itself addressed both West Coast Hotel and Brown,\nand found that neither supported Roe’s overruling. In West\nCoast Hotel, Casey explained, “the facts of economic life”\nhad proved “different from those previously assumed.” 505\nU. S., at 862. And even though “Plessy was wrong the day\nit was decided,” the passage of time had made that ever\nmore clear to ever more citizens: “Society’s understanding\nof the facts” in 1954 was “fundamentally different” than in\n1896. Id., at 863. So the Court needed to reverse course.\n“In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed\ncircumstances may impose new obligations.” Id., at 864.\nAnd because such dramatic change had occurred, the public\ncould understand why the Court was acting. “[T]he Nation\ncould accept each decision” as a “response to the Court’s\nconstitutional duty.” Ibid. But that would not be true of a\nreversal of Roe—“[b]ecause neither the factual underpin-\nnings of Roe’s central holding nor our understanding of it\nhas changed.” 505 U. S., at 864.\n   That is just as much so today, because Roe and Casey con-\ntinue to reflect, not diverge from, broad trends in American\nsociety. It is, of course, true that many Americans, includ-\ning many women, opposed those decisions when issued and\ndo so now as well. Yet the fact remains: Roe and Casey were\nthe product of a profound and ongoing change in women’s\nroles in the latter part of the 20th century. Only a dozen\nyears before Roe, the Court described women as “the center\n"

Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971) (recog-\nnizing that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based\ndiscrimination). By 1992, when the Court decided Casey,\nthe traditional view of a woman’s role as only a wife and\nmother was “no longer consistent with our understanding\nof the family, the individual, or the Constitution.” 505\nU. S., at 897; see supra, at 15, 23–24. Under that charter,\nCasey understood, women must take their place as full and\nequal citizens.

Nothing since Ca-\nsey—no changed law, no changed fact—has undermined\nthat promise.\n                               C\n  The reasons for retaining Roe and Casey gain further\nstrength from the overwhelming reliance interests those\ndecisions have created. The Court adheres to precedent not\njust for institutional reasons, but because it recognizes that\nstability in the law is “an essential thread in the mantle of\nprotection that the law affords the individual.” Florida\nDept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v.

By characteriz-\ning Casey’s reliance arguments as “generalized assertions\nabout the national psyche,” ante, at 64, it reveals how little\nit knows or cares about women’s lives or about the suffering\nits decision will cause.\n   In Casey, the Court observed that for two decades indi-\nviduals “have organized intimate relationships and made”\nsignificant life choices “in reliance on the availability of\nabortion in the event that contraception should fail.” 505\nU. S., at 856. Over another 30 years, that reliance has so-\nlidified. For half a century now, in Casey’s words, “[t]he\nability of women to participate equally in the economic and\nsocial life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability\nto control their reproductive lives.” Ibid.; see supra, at 23–\n24. Indeed, all women now of childbearing age have grown\nup expecting that they would be able to avail themselves of\nRoe’s and Casey’s protections.\n   The disruption of overturning Roe and Casey will there-\nfore be profound. Abortion is a common medical procedure\nand a familiar experience in women’s lives. About 18 per-\ncent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and\nabout one quarter of American women will have an abortion\nbefore the age of 45.22 Those numbers reflect the predicta-\nble and life-changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving\nbirth, and becoming a parent. As Casey understood, people\ntoday rely on their ability to control and time pregnancies\nwhen making countless life decisions: where to live,\nwhether and how to invest in education or careers, how to\nallocate financial resources, and how to approach intimate\nand family relationships.

See supra, at 49. Human bod-\nies care little for hopes and plans. Events can occur after\nconception, from unexpected medical risks to changes in\nfamily circumstances, which profoundly alter what it\nmeans to carry a pregnancy to term. In all these situations,\nwomen have expected that they will get to decide, perhaps\nin consultation with their families or doctors but free from\nstate interference, whether to continue a pregnancy. For\nthose who will now have to undergo that pregnancy, the loss\nof Roe and Casey could be disastrous.\n   That is especially so for women without money. When we\n“count[ ] the cost of [Roe’s] repudiation” on women who once\nrelied on that decision, it is not hard to see where the great-\nest burden will fall. Casey, 505 U. S., at 855. In States that\nbar abortion, women of means will still be able to travel to\nobtain the services they need.25 It is women who cannot\nafford to do so who will suffer most. These are the women\nmost likely to seek abortion care in the first place. Women\nliving below the federal poverty line experience unintended\npregnancies at rates five times higher than higher income\nwomen do, and nearly half of women who seek abortion care\nlive in households below the poverty line.

See supra, at 3, 36–\n37. Even assuming that is so, increased out-of-state demand will lead to\nlonger wait times and decreased availability of service in States still\nproviding abortions. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Cu-\nriae 25–27.

Gonzales, 550\nU. S., at 172 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see supra, at 23–24.\nIt reflects that she is an autonomous person, and that soci-\nety and the law recognize her as such. Like many constitu-\ntional rights, the right to choose situates a woman in rela-\ntionship to others and to the government. It helps define a\nsphere of freedom, in which a person has the capacity to\nmake choices free of government control. As Casey recog-\nnized, the right “order[s]” her “thinking” as well as her “liv-\ning.” 505 U. S., at 856. Beyond any individual choice about\nresidence, or education, or career, her whole life reflects the\ncontrol and authority that the right grants.\n   Withdrawing a woman’s right to choose whether to con-\ntinue a pregnancy does not mean that no choice is being\nmade. It means that a majority of today’s Court has\nwrenched this choice from women and given it to the States.\nTo allow a State to exert control over one of “the most inti-\nmate and personal choices” a woman may make is not only\nto affect the course of her life, monumental as those effects\nmight be. Id., at 851. It is to alter her “views of [herself]”\nand her understanding of her “place[ ] in society” as some-\none with the recognized dignity and authority to make\nthese choices. Id., at 856. Women have relied on Roe and\nCasey in this way for 50 years. Many have never known\nanything else. When Roe and Casey disappear, the loss of\npower, control, and dignity will be immense.\n   The Court’s failure to perceive the whole swath of expec-\ntations Roe and Casey created reflects an impoverished\nview of reliance. According to the majority, a reliance in-\nterest must be “very concrete,” like those involving “prop-\nerty” or “contract.” Ante, at 64. While many of this Court’s\ncases addressing reliance have been in the “commercial con-\ntext,” Casey, 505 U.

S.,\nat 855.\n   More broadly, the majority’s approach to reliance cannot\nbe reconciled with our Nation’s understanding of constitu-\ntional rights. The majority’s insistence on a “concrete,” eco-\nnomic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a\nwide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights—\nsuch as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to\nmarry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the\nmajority’s logic, could transfer those choices to the State\nwithout having to consider a person’s settled understanding\nthat the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All\nthose rights, like the right to obtain an abortion, profoundly\naffect and, indeed, anchor individual lives.

The ma-\njority accomplishes that result without so much as consid-\nering how women have relied on the right to choose or what\nit means to take that right away. The majority’s refusal\neven to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing\nRoe and Casey is a stunning indictment of its decision.\n                               D\n   One last consideration counsels against the majority’s\nruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey.\nThe majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of\nthe law to quell the conflict over abortion—of imposing an\nunprincipled “settlement” of the issue in an effort to end\n“national division.” Ante, at 67. But that is not what Casey\ndid. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles\nof stare decisis—which the majority today ignores—in reaf-\nfirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circum-\nstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It consid-\nered every aspect of how Roe’s framework operated. It\nadhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the con-\nclusion that the law required. True enough that Casey took\nnotice of the “national controversy” about abortion: The\nCourt knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a\n“divisive issue.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 867–868; see Roe, 410\nU. S., at 116. But Casey’s reason for acknowledging public\nconflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinu-\nates. Casey addressed the national controversy in order to\nemphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases,\nfor the Court to stick to the law. Would that today’s major-\nity had done likewise.\n   Consider how the majority itself summarizes this aspect\nof Casey:\n    “The American people’s belief in the rule of law would\n    be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an insti-\n    tution that decides important cases based on principle,\n    not ‘social and political pressures.’ There is a special\n"

That is what the rule of law requires.\nAnd that is what respect for this Court depends on.\n   “The promise of constancy, once given” in so charged an\nenvironment, Casey explained, “binds its maker for as long\nas” the “understanding of the issue has not changed so fun-\ndamentally as to render the commitment obsolete.” Id., at\n868.

S. ___,\n___ (2021) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). And\nfive Justices acceded to that cynical maneuver. They let\nTexas defy this Court’s constitutional rulings, nullifying\nRoe and Casey ahead of schedule in the Nation’s second\nlargest State.\n   And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same five-\nperson majority. (We believe that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s\nopinion is wrong too, but no one should think that there is\nnot a large difference between upholding a 15-week ban on\nthe grounds he does and allowing States to prohibit abor-\ntion from the time of conception.) Now a new and bare ma-\njority of this Court—acting at practically the first moment\npossible—overrules Roe and Casey. It converts a series of\ndissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and\nCasey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion\nbans. See ante, at 57, 59, 63, and nn. 61–64 (relying on for-\nmer dissents). It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional\nright that safeguards women’s freedom and equal station.\nIt breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote\nconstancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeop-\nardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy\nand marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court’s legit-\nimacy.\n   Casey itself made the last point in explaining why it\nwould not overrule Roe—though some members of its ma-\njority might not have joined Roe in the first instance. Just\nas we did here, Casey explained the importance of stare de-\ncisis; the inappositeness of West Coast Hotel and Brown; the\nabsence of any “changed circumstances” (or other reason)\njustifying the reversal of precedent. 505 U. S., at 864; see\nsupra, at 30–33, 37–47. “[T]he Court,” Casey explained,\n“could not pretend” that overruling Roe had any “justifica-\ntion beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out dif-\nferently from the Court of 1973.” 505 U. S., at 864. And to\noverrule for that reason?

[207] "60   DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n\n          BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting\n\nexplained that to do so—to reverse prior law “upon a ground\nno firmer than a change in [the Court’s] membership”—\nwould invite the view that “this institution is little different\nfrom the two political branches of the Government.” Ibid.\nNo view, Casey thought, could do “more lasting injury to\nthis Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding\nmission to serve.” Ibid. For overruling Roe, Casey con-\ncluded, the Court would pay a “terrible price.” 505 U. S., at\n864.\n   The Justices who wrote those words—O’Connor, Ken-\nnedy, and Souter—they were judges of wisdom. They would\nnot have won any contests for the kind of ideological purity\nsome court watchers want Justices to deliver. But if there\nwere awards for Justices who left this Court better than\nthey found it? And who for that reason left this country\nbetter? And the rule of law stronger? Sign those Justices\nup.\n   They knew that “the legitimacy of the Court [is] earned\nover time.” Id., at 868. They also would have recognized\nthat it can be destroyed much more quickly. They worked\nhard to avert that outcome in Casey. The American public,\nthey thought, should never conclude that its constitutional\nprotections hung by a thread—that a new majority, adher-\ning to a new “doctrinal school,” could “by dint of numbers”\nalone expunge their rights. Id., at 864. It is hard—no, it is\nimpossible—to conclude that anything else has happened\nhere. One of us once said that “[i]t is not often in the law\nthat so few have so quickly changed so much.” S. Breyer,\nBreaking the Promise of Brown: The Resegregation of\nAmerica’s Schools 30 (2022). For all of us, in our time on\nthis Court, that has never been more true than today. In\noverruling Roe and Casey, this Court betrays its guiding\nprinciples.\n   With sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many mil-\nlions of American women who have today lost a fundamen-\ntal constitutional protection—we dissent.\n"

<p># From this code, we can see on which pages there were references to Roe v. Wade. However, I do know that both Roe and Wade are mentioned in the first page, so I would like to figure out why this is not appearing in my results.</p>
<p># Next steps: work on pre-processing and generating co-occurrence matrices. I would also like to play around with data visualization.</p>
