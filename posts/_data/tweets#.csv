16,2022-09-21 06:44:59+00:00,africasnas,This probably seems so silly but I'm annoyed that none of the #LoveIsBlindJapan cast members have verified Instagram accounts while Netflix will make sure to get every single American reality show cast member a verified Instagram account.

21,2022-09-20 19:04:25+00:00,Leamoncello,Shuntaro almost lost Ayano in the pods by not speaking up and it appears he learned nothing from that experience. The women are so direct and half of the men have misled them throughout the process. This is nuts. #LoveIsBlindJapan

23,2022-09-19 23:33:57+00:00,Leamoncello,I dunno if it’s having to read the words that is making it sink in more but how is it that the men don’t think of the future much compared to the women? #LoveIsBlindJapan

31,2022-09-18 20:59:17+00:00,africasnas,My favourite thing about Midori and Wataru's relationship is they reassure each other. When the other isn't sure and is feeling insecurities about the relationship the other takes charge and make their intention clear. #LoveIsBlindJapan

If she has doubts it’s just cuz she’s human. Everyone stop judging as if you won’t take a sec if your man looks like an ogre.  #LoveIsBlindJapan
727,2022-03-12 09:50:58+00:00,TamarindGal,I like Ayano and I was rooting for her and Shuntaro BUT I am SO HAPPY that Shuntaro didn’t go through with it. He deserves a woman who will make him HAPPY and not someone he has to drag around. I mean look at him with his boys at the end. JUST LOOK 🥰🥰 #LoveIsBlindJapan

3076,2022-02-22 20:47:18+00:00,Chechu_Brz,I really don't get people talking badly about Priya. The guy lied and I think she was smart to push instead of marrying into something that was completely made up. Butterflies are nice but you have to see the practical side too. Marriage is not only about love.  #LoveIsBlindJapan
3077,2022-02-22 20:46:59+00:00,cvaha96,#LoveIsBlindJapan i just dont get what Midori’s deal is. This guy hella been working on himself and she still ain’t satisfied. 😢

5707,2022-02-15 11:28:17+00:00,LuthienDior,Midami/Mori should just end it. They are forcing the other person to become what they are not and that takes a toll on your mental. Midami is just so subdued &amp; it hurts to see her lively personality being so suppressed. They both like different personalities  #LoveIsBlindJapan
5708,2022-02-15 11:28:06+00:00,NftAdvocate,@rle__ @fluffho My biggest gripe is with people saying stuff like the girls were ‘done dirty’. How? By having Japanese men on the show? These are average Japanese guys. I feel like people who have never lived in Japan may not understand the difference in beauty standard. #LoveIsBlindJapan

He doesn't like how upfront she is with the criticism which might end up hurting the other person, valid. But if she loses her quirks &amp; becomes docile then that's not her. #LoveIsBlindJapan"
5722,2022-02-15 10:53:27+00:00,geekxxchic,Honestly it's getting exhausting with Midori. She has a complaint for everything about Wataru. He's going to be miserable if he marries her. #LoveIsBlindJapan

5731,2022-02-15 10:11:57+00:00,geekxxchic,I will say that I respect that the couples who see major issues are willing to walk away before the wedding. I know it's less dramatic but it's more realistic and mature #LoveIsBlindJapan
5732,2022-02-15 10:05:07+00:00,geekxxchic,Yudai...why in Beyonce's name would you propose to a woman over 30 w/o checking to see if she wants kids in the near future? And Nana why wouldn't you check the same of a guy in his early 20s? At least they know for the next relationship I guess... #LoveIsBlindJapan
5733,2022-02-15 10:00:58+00:00,geekxxchic,Both Nanako and Odacchi have communication issues. She has to let him know what she's feeling and he needs to let her know why he acts like he does. I'm losing faith by the second... #LoveIsBlindJapan

6357,2022-02-12 10:02:52+00:00,NftAdvocate,I’m not saying the people who have criticised the men are racists. I am saying their statements are unintentionally racist statements. Beauty standards are normal. I just think people didn’t realise the standards are different in different countries #LoveIsBlindJapan
6358,2022-02-12 09:54:45+00:00,NftAdvocate,Saying the Japanese girls ‘were done dirty’ is equivalent to saying they were done dirty by having Japanese men on the show. Coz that was a very representative group of Japanese men. People who haven’t lived in Japan won’t know that. #LoveIsBlindJapan
6359,2022-02-12 09:50:58+00:00,NftAdvocate,My main point is as an outsider saying basically all of the Japanese male contestants (which there were a decent amount) were unattractive becomes a racial thing real quick. All you are doing at that point is putting your own beauty standards on another culture. #LoveIsBlindJapan
6360,2022-02-12 09:50:58+00:00,RainysRainys,Also it’s a little disgusting how sexual western society is. When you watch #Loveisblind and then #LoveIsBlindJapan I definitely prefer how the Japanese are doing things.
6361,2022-02-12 09:49:38+00:00,RainysRainys,Guys tweet what you want about #LoveisblindJapan obviously not racist shit don’t be a dickhead. But there is a weirdo going round accusing you of being racist for not finding the men attractive.

If you go to japan, many girls they might consider ‘undesirable’ because of some extra fat are considered gorgeous to other cultures. #LoveIsBlindJapan #Asianboss"
6375,2022-02-12 08:27:01+00:00,NftAdvocate,@fluffho It’s the same as saying all the black contestants in an American dating show are undesirable and don’t stand a chance. Every country has their own beauty standards. #LoveIsBlindJapan please check my original thread on this topic too.
6376,2022-02-12 08:26:17+00:00,NftAdvocate,"@fluffho Japanese have their own beauty standards. These guys are normal for Japan. You are basically just expressing that you aren’t into most Japanese men. Which is fine, but in this day and age that’s considered racist to say out loud. #LoveIsBlindJapan"

6379,2022-02-12 07:52:27+00:00,NftAdvocate,People criticising the looks of the men in the show without considering differing beauty standards is dangerously close to the idea that Asian men are undesirable.
