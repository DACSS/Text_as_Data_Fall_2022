What crime did he commit?
Josh Dobbs for qb1
Is this karma for getting rid of baker? Have your ‚Äústar‚Äù rusty qb return with 5 weeks left with most likely only 4-5 games won under your belt‚Ä¶ might as well keep him on the bench. Imagine him getting seriously injured in the last few meaningless games? Fuckin browns management. Do they just do franchise mode in madden and simulate seasons? ‚ÄúHey, it worked in madden guys. Let‚Äôs trade for deshaun‚Äù
11 out of 17 games. Sounds like they should&#39;ve just suspended him for the year. Come in the next year fresh. This looked really bad on the NFLs side and Watson may have all the money but he fucked up his image for life.
I still have no idea what he did
F‚Äôck it‚Ä¶ who cares about Watson. You want ‚Äújustice‚Äù from a sports league? Okay kiddos, good luck with that.
Pat going hard on that booger sugar
Brissett has exactly 11 weeks to win the job .. that would be golden if Watson was on the bench against Houston
This entire mess of an off-season has just been a holy crap it‚Äôs hard to be a brown fan. Week one against baker and then week 12 against Houston is just like oh man why didn‚Äôt I fall for a different team
Pat looks like a grown Bart Simpson.
How can Watson lead a team of men? <br>They toss Mayfield in garbage after he plays hurt for them last year.<br>Cleveland really screwed up. I bet Mayfield is successful with Carolina
I think his suspension in 11 games and 5mil to many. He was proven innocent in court and all women only charged civil suits, money grab
And the NFL,ref, sponsors boy Brady he&#39;s 4 games for deflating footballs?
When tf was Watson a mvp candidate ü§°
That&#39;s messed up they trying to humiliate him. Those women asked for it it&#39;s all about the money for ho&#39;s
Watson isn‚Äôt that good. Honestly just above average. Can‚Äôt wait to see him come back against Houston. He‚Äôs gonna get wrecked. Browns will be back to the good ol brahns again
He shouldn&#39;t be allowed to ever wear a NFL uniform again.... This will happen again. He&#39;s a predator who wants you to dig deep deeper , no all the way...
must be a curse on the money they will take. 666,666.00 I like that. my last three digits on my Social security is 666. üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
Put me in the &quot;he should never get to play in the nfl again&quot; category!
This is a wrestling work
That‚Äôs all ?
They could lose 7 in a row easily‚Äù <br><br>Says the steelers fan the worst team in the AFC north ü§£ü§£ü§£
Anything other than being banned from the league for life is unacceptable, unfortunately the NFL has ZERO ethics or morals.  Ask Michael Vick.
I‚Äôll never watch another game he plays in. EVER. TOTAL PIG‚Ä¶ the nfl should have BANNED HIM FOR LIfE.
Piece of crap still made 20 million last year doing nothing. Let&#39;s not forget the Brown&#39;s structured his contract so he wouldn&#39;t be at monetary loss. His first year of a 230 million dollar contract is only 1 million. P.O.S.
The fact that Calvin Ridley got a whole Season and not watson is wild
This rapist should be in prison.
As a Browns fan for all of my adult life, I hope they lose every game this season.
His money is still guaranteed. So that‚Äôs dumb
The real clowns r the league ND the browns
Still not long enough. Gross.
I&#39;m a browns fan, was, I hope he he gets booed and tormented everywhere he goes. He&#39;s a serial predator and doesn&#39;t deserve to be in the league
Once a PREDATOR always a PREDATOR ü§° . 5 mill dollar fine is nothing to someone who is getting 230 million fully guaranteed. NFL ‚Äòs image is going down and down SMH üôà
I hope they bring out some of his accusers in Houston before the game as &quot;Guests of Honor&quot;
That&#39;ll learn him to bust my tomater.
FOOTBALL ! I would be in jail ?
This is definitely a work- Vince McMahon retired to become Roger Goodell‚Äôs personal advisor.
I always thought people normally go to jail for things like that. Sounds like they gave him a vacation instead
His dumbass might as well retire.. you would think if anybody DeShaun Watson probably get any woman he wanted in the Houston area but yet he does s*** like that? ü§™
His return is against Houston, what a coincidence üôÑ
Texans fans will let their feelings be known that day, and D4 will endure that in every visiting stadium FOREVER!
better turn off the crowd mics at that texans game
he should have been out for more than a year, and also Browns were stupid to even give him contract,  if another team picked him up, you know he was going to be out some games at least, so not a threat.
It should&#39;ve been suspended for the season and 10 million fine
Where&#39;s the owners being held to a &quot;higher standard&quot;?
NFL is just beating this horse to try and graze over the Flores lawsuit slowly  being proven true imo like he wasnt charged criminally and the first person suggested 6 games, between Allen&#39;s self combusting and them having to constantly come to defense of owners, they love the media focus on players. ITs easy to put all the blame on one then cut them and act like all the corruption was caused by them.
I can count! 11 games would be vs tampa bay! Why are their an extra 2 games added?
But they got players banned for weed lmao. What a joke
If the victims chose money over legal justice, the league should do the same
If he was average at football he‚Äôd be behind bars
11 Games is still a Joke.
They should have made it a $6 million dollar fine, then the total with the games missed would be sixes across the board.
Slap on the wrist
I kinda want to burn some cash to go to the Texans v Browns game... That&#39;s gonna be a spectacle
Was a big Texan fan n I hope DW balls out n beat the Texans. The owner ruined that team
Odd numbers usually are a bit of a problem! Do the math fools. Browns still miss the playoffs,
Still say it should have been one game for each case!
This whole thing has been a woke  blackmail. DeShawn Watson is correct he went to court not guilty didn&#39;t meet criminal prosecution level. Every professional athlete needs to keep their junk in their pants. He is guilty only of breaking an NFL rule and you don&#39;t even get fined 5mil for murdering a person or unable to work for 700 days. Pretty steep punishment for a massage and whatever where they could have simply walked out of the room.
NFL IS A JOKE. SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIFETIME BAN FOR HIM. HES AN ADULT HE KNEW WHAT IS WAS DOING. NO GAMES WILL BE PLAYED IN MY HOUSE EVER AGAIN. THIS SHOWS NFL AND THE COACHES HAVE NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN. ALL THE CARE ABOUT IS RATING AND PLAYERS. HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A PREDATOR. YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER TO BE AROUND A MAN THAT DOESNT APOLOGIZE AND STOP AFTER THE FIRST TIME. NO IT TOOK NFL MAKING A DECISION FOR HIM TO APOLOGIZE AND STILL HE DID NOT MEAN IT. WHOMEVER THESE WOMEN ARE THEY NEED TO SUE THE HE** OUT OF HIM THE COACHES AND THE HEADS OF THE NFL. TAKE THEM FOR ALL THEIR HOUSES THEIR CARS AND THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK. THEY WILL BE DROPPED FROM ANY INVESTMENTS THEY HAVE. ALL FOUND HIM GUILTY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTERS AND ALL TEENS AND WOMEN. NFL HAS FAILED ALL FEMALES. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO KEEP A KNOWN PREDATOR ON A WORLD WIDE PLATFORM. I AM DONE THIS WAS THE VERY LAST STRAW FOR ME AND MINE. IM EMBARRASSED FOR YOU BEING IN THE USA. NO RESPECT.
REMEMBER he missed an entire season ALREADY!  Let the man FREE!!!
There&#39;s one thing about doing something from a lapse of jugement.  But this is multiple dozens of times.  He shouldn&#39;t be playing in this league period
What happened to innocent until proven guilty? When the NFL became a woman&#39;s easy money tickets for bs! These women offer a happy ending for their services, where is their accountability? Only shame, guilt, insult, deception, disingenuous and need to be right! Women lead and we as men follow! They were the predators and he was their prey!
It‚Äôll be a Sunday night game watch lmao
Well Ezekiel Elliott got a 6 game ban after being accused by one woman. Deshaun  Watson was accused by 24. By that president he should 144 games.
Smh
Don‚Äôt be woke people woman get money hungry woman literally went back two to three times. Gtfoh free deshawn
He was already suspended a year. So how come he went through three court systems and still nothing. Looks like woman wanted money. What about the woman that came back two three times.
Deshaun Watson has some Karl Malone energy
Every Game Watson plays in will be Interesting with the Crowd comments/ yells.
2 criminal courts say nothing here by refusing to indite<br><br>first judge says there‚Äôs the potential for something to be here pages 5/6/14/15 let‚Äôs give him 6<br><br>Then the NFL hires someone else and they settle on 11.<br><br>I‚Äôm sorry but if this man did something why hasn‚Äôt anyone really brung some real form of punishment ?
Everything that‚Äôs wrong with our society‚Ä¶..The NFL.  Watson saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù.   A judge being told, ‚Äúyour ruling isn‚Äôt good enough‚Äù.   And worst of all?  Being influenced by public opinion.   We live in clown world.
Rkelly would be proud
I bet RKelly is upset that DeShawn is getting away with it
Now that the fans know exactly what game he‚Äôs coming back for, they should boycott the game and have the stadium completely empty only filled with used towels on the seats and bottles of lotion. Oh and spread some massage parlor incense too. Ask Kyrie Irving for his sage stick. That‚Äôll make Deshaun REALLY feel right at home in Houston. Let the NFL have to visually put that onto television because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd be able to stop all the fans from rushing out of the arena before the game starts. They‚Äôd have no choice but to either start the game and scramble or cancel it. Force the NFL to also feel this awful decision too.
The browns are so f&#39;d
take 5m from blackQB  but the texans owner 1.5million sad case of racism
Imagine if they suspended Watson the 11 games, let him play against Houston, then immediately suspended him the rest of the season. The Texans game just turned out to be a part of the punishment.
So the NFL is saying you can do what ever you want to women just dont bet on it
The NFL is kink shaming Deshaun.
This will backfire for Cleveland....
Much like this show the nfl is a joke. What an embarrassment.
Ok so settlements dont prove guilt! What about an apology to the women he attacked?<br>There have been players that have done way less of a CRIME and never played another down of football!!<br>He only gets a slap on the wrist! What a joke
Yo Pat what&#39;s in that stack of papers under the gold brain üß†  paper weight
NFLPA, where the P stands for Predator.
I can&#39;t get with this.  I know I&#39;m done with the Browns, I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;ll feel about the NFL all together.
So Baker against the Browns week 1 and Deshaun against the Texans in week 13. NFL acting like The Shade Room. They petty lol
Was the first part, the monologue, read off of a teleprompter? Coz if not, goddamn dude.
What about the owner of the Washington commander‚Äôs who is getting investigated for the 2nd time over sexual harassment, I need that same energy  but ain‚Äôt nobody want‚Äôs to talk about that huh, let‚Äôs rather focus on the young black player
Lmao brisket is terrible üòÇ ü§£ üò≠
If Bauer gets 2 years for being cleared in a court room, Watson should defiantly get at least two season.
To be completely fair... why would a multi millionaire pro athlete think he couldn&#39;t get jerked off by a messuse once in a while? If they were non violent incidents then idk... is it really that bad? Correct me if I missed something I don&#39;t follow this story too close.
The NFL is a self manufactured soap opera.
Let me get this right, the man was not indicted by not one, but two grand juries, has or will pay millions in settlements to the ladies civilly, gets 11 games suspended, and 5 mil fine on top of that. Ray Lewis was fined 250,000 for being complicit in a murder. Something seems unbalanced....excessive. I know, poor girls.
A Billionaire Owner is fined 1 million and A Millionaire Player is fined 5 million! Hum???? Big Ben Rapes a women and gets 6 games, Watson receives massages from women that &quot;DONT USUALLY GIVE MASSAGES BUT STILL CHOOSES TO MASSGE HIM&quot;??? Gets 11 games and $5 Million, 5 times as much as a Billionaire Owner, Back against the Houston Texans???? What? They moved the Goalpost Again for the Colored man with &quot;NO VIOLENT ACTS&quot; AGAINST HIM! Like Big Ben TAKEN A WOMANS PRIVATES FORCEFULLY???? Let&#39;s Rewrite the Laws for Watson hurray!!! Same ol&#39; stuff
What people don&#39;t understand is, the punishment is for bringing bad press to the league. When you see it like that, it makes perfect sense that his game back is against the Texans. The ratings he&#39;s going to bring in will help pay back the league for the bad press.
You would think if the nfl really cared about the women they would split the 5 million between all the ladies that came forward ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What a joke.
Does any of that $5M go to the women who filed charges against him? Or is the NFL just profiting off of this
Browns got a brutal schedule with or without Watson
Browns vs Texans should be flexed to Primetime!
