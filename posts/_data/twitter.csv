"2572","Also, this Ayano girl is probably the prettiest in the show but it seems she's the most insecure. She's a people pleaser and needs constant validation. #LoveisBlindJapan","2022-07-05 05:01:57+00:00"

"2580","Although I am still in ""let's cancel the Netflix acct"" negotiations, #LoveIsBlindJapan was good.

"4507","I ❤️ Motomi &amp; Ryotaro! Their just cute, romantic and very loving. But I relate more to Midori. It's amazing how Wataru kept showing Midori that his love and patience would always be there. Why do you men do this to me? #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-26 22:23:28+00:00"

"4510","I absolutely love Ryotaro on Love Is Blind Japan. He's basically a grown Ryuji with a sweet heart and he and Motomi would make for a great josei manga (rough looking guy/demure woman story). https://t.co/TjP9yLDTLh","2022-02-15 02:10:47+00:00"

"4513","I actually enjoyed Love is Blind Japan. So much emotions, realness and maturity in one season. #LoveIsBlind #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-26 02:57:54+00:00"
"4514","I actually liked Ryotaro and think that Motomi felt disppointed on seeing him. I hope they are together be ause I can see them together and maybe because I like Ryotaro the most out of all the guys and their letter exchanges were the cutest thing. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-08 19:38:16+00:00"
"4515","i actually love and with priya, like shes a career woman with a clear vision of what she wants to achieve, its only natural for her to feel repulsed by mizuki who isnt on her wavelength.

and finding he's actually an employee instead of the owner? Fraud!!!

 #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-20 04:09:25+00:00"
"4516","I admire ppl like Priya who are very clear about who they are and what they want in life, also Shuntaro deserves someone more mature. He's very patient, understanding, &amp; loving. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-08 04:41:32+00:00"
"4517","I admittedly love the American versions but the Japan edition of ‘Love is Blind’ is TONS better. It might come across odd to people who haven’t consumed a lot of Japanese media but either way, it’s such a delight to watch. cc @MegaMaraMon 🌸 https://t.co/y7TeU6G594","2022-02-22 02:06:58+00:00"
"4518","I agree with Slate: Love is Blind-Japan is a much more satisfying watch. One version manufactures drama. The other finds it in real problems. https://t.co/n6yibd17HS via @slate","2022-03-06 17:47:16+00:00"
"4519","I already felt the dad's day out vibes with shuntaro &amp; Ayano, then I saw her painting and it was confirmed. 
Also, why does she look so oily and shiny? Is that a Japanese fashion thing? Genuine question.

"4520","I already finished Love is Blind Japan, so decided to watch the Brazil version, but looks like I got kicked out of my own account that I am paying for 😂

Just when things are getting heated between the couples! Well, off to bed for me now! https://t.co/fnVmavWVkd","2022-02-23 15:23:37+00:00"
"4521","I also find Midori's obsession with Wataru's appearance off-putting. She's pretty, but not exactly Miss World Japan (who was her competitor for his affection). 
I really don't think she's in the right to demand changes from him. 
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 03:47:36+00:00"
"4522","I also love how good the couples eat? Japanese people have a style of eating dinner that I loveeee. A proper bit of everything everywhere. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-18 20:04:50+00:00"
"4523","I also love how there is an emphasis on getting to know each other. No rushing into sex and physical intimacy and a genuine respect for that aspect of courtship.

"4524","I also love that she's blunt, she's gorgeous af, she wants to make charts about the men she talks to and she even made a presentation for Wataru. She wears her heart on her sleeve.

"4608","I compared a little of Love is Blind, Love is Blind Brazil, and Love is Blind Japan. In the first two, almost everyone lies right away and is shockingly rude and petty, in ways that make me feel ashamed.

"4643","I don't know if this is a controversial take or not but Love Blind Japan has been literally the best to come out of this franchise. For once you can feel they're all emotionally invested in actually find a life partner and understand the concept of the show.","2022-02-17 22:09:28+00:00"
"4644","I don't know if this is for TV or cuz they're very public facing right now, but I am very impressed with how the Japanese cast always have something nice to say, even when they're trying to have a talk about some bullshit. #LoveIsBlindJapan #LoveIsBlind #ラブイズブラインドJapan","2022-02-23 02:18:43+00:00"

"5052","I ran out of love is blind season 2 episodes so now I’m watching love is blind Japan… my reality tv dating show love never ceases","2022-02-17 01:57:38+00:00"
"5053","I ran to IG for Updates and I'm so happy.
My favs Are together.
Midori gave me a scare with her indecisions but I'm glad she still with Wataru.
That man is the definition of Patience &amp; Love.

"5054","I realize I haven’t rushed to watch the Love is Blind Japan finale because I don’t want it to end. Meanwhile, season 2 of the US edition is filling the true trashy tv void in my life.","2022-02-27 19:09:22+00:00"
"5055","I realized Love is Blind Japan sort of gave me the same comforting feeling as the Korean variety show We Got Married but unlike WGM, this show was not scripted and contestants really did get married.","2022-03-06 06:46:59+00:00"
"5056","I realized why love is blind: japan has a familiarity to it, I mean, the whole series is channeling sleepless in seattle vibes.","2022-03-04 07:12:25+00:00"
"5057","I really appreciate the gentle pace of thos season #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-12 11:57:06+00:00"
"5058","I really appreciate the rawness of #LoveIsBlindJapan, the difficulty in navigating living together after falling in love in the pods is so honest. The show is also directed so well, the stories are told so beautifully.","2022-09-18 20:04:19+00:00"
"5059","I really be attracted to older men. I really like the older man in Love is Blind: Japan 😭","2022-04-23 19:01:26+00:00"
"5060","I really could not make it living in asia. Watching love is blind Japan and this girl said “wow 5’9 that’s so tall” to a guy","2022-02-16 07:39:48+00:00"
"5061","I really do feel bad for the girls who didn’t match bc that has to be a blow to the self esteem. 

You’re thinking this guy you can’t stop thinking about feels that too, then your roommate comes in saying he just proposed to her

"5062","I really don't get people talking badly about Priya. The guy lied and I think she was smart to push instead of marrying into something that was completely made up. Butterflies are nice but you have to see the practical side too. Marriage is not only about love.  #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-22 20:47:18+00:00"
"5063","I really don't get this Ayano babe, she's great at being cutesy and just stringing the man along #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-22 11:56:07+00:00"

"5067","I really enjoy the energy of #LoveIsBlindJapan. It’s more mellow and thoughtful. It’s easier for me to imagine being vulnerable and open in that setting. The chaos of #LoveIsBlindBrazil was fun to watch but I would tap out so early!","2022-02-13 17:06:21+00:00"
"5068","I really enjoyed #LoveIsBlindJapan. Also, it made me hungry all the time! #misowitheverything","2022-04-14 06:22:55+00:00"

"5070","I really enjoyed how sincere and heartfelt this edition was. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-22 18:42:40+00:00"
"5071","i really feel for wataru.  it must be SO painful to see the person you love debate whether or not they even are attracted to you. This is Shake/Deepti sitch again and my advice is the same: find someone else who doesnt even need to question that #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-23 04:39:22+00:00"
"5072","I really hope Priya and Mizuki end up together!!

More than the American version tbh.","2022-02-20 16:59:51+00:00"
"5075","I really like #Priya and #Midori, they stood out for me amongst the ladies, so confident, assertive, and smart. They definitely know what they want, and I love it
#loveisblindjapan","2022-04-03 17:12:07+00:00"
"5076","i really like how love is blind japan focuses on the little things that make compromises difficult in relationships and how they give viewers a lot of breathing space!!","2022-02-21 14:01:12+00:00"
"5077","I really like Midori. I love that she is a nervous ball of energy.

"5080","I really like Midori’s confidence as a woman but as a partner to Wataru I feel like she’s always doing things to humiliate him😔 I still have that apprehension towards her #LoveisblindJapan","2022-02-23 02:15:17+00:00"
"5081","I really like Minori &amp; Wataru  together and her not being attracted to his looks is fine but like you don’t have to remind him every 5 mins #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-09 06:48:02+00:00"
"5082","I really like that Love is Blind &amp; Love is Blind Japan separated their releases so I can watch both with ease 😌","2022-02-17 01:16:27+00:00"
"5083","i really like that Love is Blind Japan has more of a documentary vibe rather than a reality show. the silences every now and then and no background music while they’re talking is really nice","2022-02-24 00:50:14+00:00"
"5084","i really like the comedian guy #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-13 02:12:54+00:00"
"5085","I really like the doctor #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-08 16:32:43+00:00"
"5086","I really liked Midori in the beginning you know, she seemed sure, genuine and ready to find love. And it's annoying tf out of me how she fought for him, literally cried and made him feel like she was so 100% for him.....  #Loveisblindjapan","2022-02-16 04:53:52+00:00"
"5087","I really liked minami and mori's arc. They stayed true to who they were in spite of everything. I see them as people who would have bit their tongue in a normal setting but bravely chose to be vulnerable coz of the timeline. Must have been tough . 頑張ったね #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 19:43:37+00:00"
"5088","i really liked mori and minami but also both of them hurt each other and hot hurt it just makes sense... however.. i think the direction pushed the blame on minami a lot more, unfairly so #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 13:40:54+00:00"
"5089","I really liked Shuntaro &amp; Ayano and thought he would be perfect for her because of how she is and her insecurities so I’m really disappointed in her behaviour toward him. All he wants is to treat her like a princess and give her the love she deserves #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-19 21:57:15+00:00"
"5090","I really liked that in #LoveIsBlindJapan the couples were able to walk away from the process without having to wait for the wedding day to say no…i don’t know why in the US they don’t give them that option…","2022-02-25 23:40:45+00:00"
"5091","I really liked the first season of Love is Blind Japan! I had so much fun watching. ❤️❤️ Nobody made me want to kill then, and both of the married couples are so great together! 🥰🥰🥰","2022-02-22 23:55:35+00:00"
"5092","I really love Mori + Minami so much individually, like, I hope they know how amazing they both are? I think they just really struggled together. I genuinely think they're both fantastic, unique, cool humans 😭💙 #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-16 16:54:38+00:00"
"5093","I really love the color-themed rooms. The pillows match the walls which match the door but the carpet is grass green in all the rooms which give it just enough contrast. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-15 03:39:37+00:00"
"5094","I really Mori and Minami tgt #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-15 17:55:31+00:00"
"5095","I really really enjoyed Love is Blind Japan. It was so heartwarming—very low drama and not sensationalized, which was refreshing. Also, seeing the cultural differences was super interesting. I hope they make a season 2!","2022-03-11 17:46:22+00:00"

"5098","I really thought midori was gone tell manz no #loveisblindjapan","2022-03-05 03:00:46+00:00"
"5099","I really thought the love is blind contestants were contractually obligated to show up to the wedding because of the American season 1. I respect the Japanese contestants who walked away ahead of time once they saw they were incompatible with their partner. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 00:43:15+00:00"
"5100","i really want midori and wataru together..hopefully motomi chooses ryotaro and odacchi being all nervous while confessing his feelings to nanako was so cute!! 😭😭 #loveisblindjapan","2022-02-28 19:43:15+00:00"

"5104","I really want to watch Love is blind: Japan, but can I handle the subtitles? Someone needs to dub this show for me.","2022-02-19 09:42:59+00:00"
"5105","I really wanted to see Atsushi end up with someone. I don't think he's a bad guy, he just has different values. 
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-10 12:22:56+00:00"
"5106","I really wish the English subtitles would keep the person’s name up while they’re speaking. But otherwise I love the thoughtful mature vibe from E1 #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-12 18:56:24+00:00"
"5107","I recently watched love is blind Japan edition. I love hearing their voices. With voice overs the same two voices would say every one's words and you would lose the emotions you hear with subtitles.","2022-02-13 14:25:01+00:00"
"5108","I refuse to believe that it’s over between Mori &amp; Minami 😭😭😭😭😭  I was rooting for them ☹️💔 #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 05:16:44+00:00"
"5109","I REFUSE to settle down until I find a man who speaks to me like we’re on the first season of Love is Blind: Japan","2022-03-10 02:19:37+00:00"
"5110","I refuse to watch this season of Love Is Blind just based off of the snippets I've seen, so instead I'm watching Love Is Blind: Japan. Next is Love Is Blind: Brazil.","2022-03-04 15:58:43+00:00"
"5111","I respect people who love their people but also have realistic lense through which to view them.

Living in Japan I can tell you their blind overconfidence in themselves is a weakness.  One which the west is already massively exploiting. (Most of them don't notice.) https://t.co/AlZ9Y6JuZ1","2022-08-06 16:18:15+00:00"
"5112","I rooted for 6 couples:

-Motomi &amp; Ryotaro
-Ayano &amp; Shutaro 
-Nanako &amp; Odacchi 
-Kauru &amp; Misaki 
-Priya &amp; Mizuki 

Only 2 made it to the end and said “Yes”. I’m so happy my top 2 are MARRIED 😁💃🏾

"5115","I said I wasn't going to watch #LoveIsBlindJapan but...I done got interested now. So far, I've enjoyed all of the versions &amp; Japan is shaping up to be interesting to me as well.

"5185","I think I wanna start the Love Is Blind-Japan just to laugh","2022-02-25 23:53:16+00:00"
"5186","I think I’m about to start Love is Blind Japan and see how that one is because season two of US was an absolute train wreck. They had to change up some stuff compared to the first season.","2022-03-07 04:46:11+00:00"
"5187","I think I’m gonna give love is blind Japan a shot …","2022-02-25 17:56:48+00:00"
"5188","I think I’m in love with Shuntaro from love is blind Japan……","2022-03-16 01:59:05+00:00"
"5189","I think it's interesting that a lot of Americans romanticized #loveisblindjapan. I found their pod conversations to be more surface level and I was surprised by how many said they cared about looks. Why be on the show if that's the case","2022-03-10 05:36:57+00:00"
"5190","I think it's the editing but I feel like I'm missing so much context with the arguments the couples have
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 00:57:59+00:00"
"5191","I think it’s fair to say I like Love is Blind, Japan more than U.S. season 2. #LoveIsBlind #LoveIsBlindJapan #LoveIsBlindS2","2022-02-20 09:27:44+00:00"
"5192","I think it’s the first time seeing Misaki with his hair brushed and in a workplace environment 😭 &amp; finally Mizuki is working on growing his food business!!!! Priya excelling in her element as always&lt;3 a true entrepreneur #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-22 23:07:28+00:00"
"5193","I think Mizuki and Pri instead of bringing out the best in both, they are bringing out the worst😅 Mizuki's signs of affection consist of saying how beautiful she is so it seems he only cares that she is pretty idk. But she shows nothing at all 💀

#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 13:59:14+00:00"
"5194","I think Mizuki and Priya doesn't match at all. Priya is too rude and sometimes her attitude pisses me off but it is also understandable sometimes because Mizuki tells half truths😅. Seems like it's the only way he thinks she can like him or smth...

#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 13:59:13+00:00"
"5195","I think Motomi and Ryo are my favorite couple so far. They're really adorable! I like their whole dynamic and conversations!😍 #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-07 01:20:21+00:00"

"5199","I think Nana deserves to stay in the hotel. Yudai can go #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-20 01:40:14+00:00"
"5200","I think one of the best things about #LoveIsBlindJapan is that they had a love triangle with two ladies really into the same guy, and once they were out of the pods they gave that triangle absolutely zero screen time because that type of drama is stupid and pointless","2022-02-19 00:25:29+00:00"
"5201","I think Priya and Mizuki are my favourite #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-09 13:48:53+00:00"
"5202","I think the thing about love is blind Japan compared to the USA version, Japan's one feels like a romantic melodrama while the USA one feels like a romantic comedy. both have shown that the participants are flawed and struggle with the concept of love in blind.. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 23:45:40+00:00"
"5203","I think there are some good aspects to Love is blind japan, I don't hate everything? and it's way better than Terrace house, that series was my pandemic obsession but it's so f*cked up","2022-02-28 18:15:03+00:00"
"5204","I think this Netflix show ""Love is blind - Japan"" will give me a lot to comment on.  I'm still on episode 2. XD","2022-02-15 01:33:48+00:00"
"5205","I think this series is more cute!!

#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-18 03:23:30+00:00"
"5206","I think Wataru and Midori will succeed as a couple.

I think it was perfectly healthy for Midori to be second guessing the process, I mean I would. Glad it clicked for her. They gel well together and he loves Lupin.🤧

"5207","i think yudai chose the wrong girl :/ we'll see, i guess... #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-11 14:23:35+00:00"
"5208","I thoroughly enjoyed watching #LoveIsBlindJapan way better than the US version.  They show so much respect no matter the outcome.","2022-02-24 14:39:42+00:00"
"5209","I thoroughly, and I mean THOROUGHLY enjoyed #LoveIsBlindJapan. Wow! It was so beautiful, so poetic also…maybe it’s something inherent in the Japanese culture, but even the relationships that broke, broke so beautifully.","2022-03-12 15:21:58+00:00"
"5210","I thought I was doing OK in my Japanese learning, then I started watching Love Is Blind: Japan on Netflix.  They talk so fast. Only understood one word so far. I am terrible at languages. I love trying to learn them, but man, terrible at them.","2022-02-11 04:27:26+00:00"
"5211","I thought I was over the Love Is Blind series after the Brazil edition, but then Love Is Blind Japan came out and now I can't stop watching.","2022-02-26 00:32:33+00:00"
"5212","I thought i would finally draw today, instead i watched Love is Blind Japan for three hours.","2022-03-03 05:51:24+00:00"
"5213","I thought it was just a Terrace House🤝Love is Blind Japan crossover. Heck, Hide from Ainori is there too! #LoveisBlindJapan","2022-07-05 20:37:57+00:00"
"5214","I thought Motomi was pretty conservative in her dressing style, almost frumpy. She dressed too old for her age. Glad to see Ryotaro was an influence on her. She looked more stylish. They looked great together. #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/vMcZ1Ugyuf","2022-02-25 05:36:17+00:00"
"5215","I thought Ryotaro meeting with Motomi's parents it's  gonna be intense  but it was totally the opposite so heart warming 🥺 I may have shed a tear or two while watching that scene. #loveisblindjapan","2022-02-22 11:08:12+00:00"
"5216","i thought she was going to say no. i was about to fight haha #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-26 06:48:17+00:00"

"5218","I thought there will never be another Terrace House for me, but Love is Blind Japan is so wholesome and pure…it’s impossible not to find it endearing. 

There’s so much beauty in the mundane and ordinary everyday life ❤️","2022-02-27 03:45:52+00:00"
"5219","I told myself I wasn’t going to start Love is Blind: Japan tonight, but just… one episode. Just to get a feel of it 🙂","2022-03-05 03:18:14+00:00"
"5220","I took a break from bashing my head against the wall over Republican criminals to watch Love is Blind Japan. I really enjoyed learning something about Japanese culture &amp; how truly polite and compassionate they are. I would love to visit Japan.","2022-04-01 05:00:06+00:00"
"5221","I took a break from bingeing Dragon Age games and Resident Evil books, to binge Love Is Blind season 2 and Love Is Blind Japan. I mean, certainly a ""guilty pleasure"" either way, but I actually thought that the Japan season was pretty nice","2022-03-15 13:21:39+00:00"

"5226","I understand Ayano and Shuntaro’s age gap is large, but if she strings that man along, I will be so furious. He just wants a simple, happy life. It’s so sweet! #LoveIsBlindJapan 

(Yes, now I’m on to Japan)","2022-02-19 04:09:40+00:00"
"5227","I understand midori's pov but her mother is absolutely right. She needs to come down to reality, the idea of the absolutely perfect guy is pretty much a lie and so far wataru is everything but 'good-looking' and I don't get how that's such a huge dealbreaker. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-23 17:57:04+00:00"
"5228","I used to laugh at Sharee and co for liking Korean movies. Now guess who watched Love Is Blind Japan and is keen and curious about Japan’s culture. Lolololol. I am laughing at myself.","2022-02-23 09:53:28+00:00"

"5255","I was expecting #LoveIsBlindJapan to just be more cringe - albeit addictive - trash. But it is the sweetest show! Such a reserved, respectful, wise and kind bunch of people. No drama or back stabbing - an absolute feel good, heart warmer! ♥️ #loveisblind","2022-02-17 01:12:36+00:00"
"5256","I was fully hooked on Love Is Blind S2 when it came out. After bingeing it I started watching LIB Japan to fill the void and OMG, I like the people on that show even more. It's so good.( I also love peeking into their homes and on their dinner plates)","2022-03-12 15:32:54+00:00"

"6184","It's funny that one of the guys on #LoveIsBlindJapan didn't even know his fiancee's last name, but every guy on #LoveIsBlindBrazil know all 8 of each of their fiancee's names.","2022-03-13 20:00:31+00:00"
"6185","It's honestly such a weird thing to see how well Wataru and Midori work together personality and lifestyle wise. Truly the only thing is the physical. I hope she can overcome that b/c they seem to work well together otherwise #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 17:21:20+00:00"
"6186","It's me watching both #LoveIsBlindS2 and #LoveIsBlindJapan and only caring about Ryotaro and Mitomi getting married.  I'm so happy for them y'all 😭 I legit cried.  Honestly, all the other couples can go, no shade, but these two were the only ones giving me real chemistry.","2022-02-26 20:22:28+00:00"

"6210","It’s hard to tell but I think the dream that tore Mori and Minami apart is his desire to move to a developing country in Asia or Africa. He has a heart for the less fortunate which is wonderful… #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-17 00:37:33+00:00"
"6211","It’s interesting how there’s a level of pragmatism that lives alongside live in #LoveIsBlind Japan. Like “ok butterflies, check. Now let’s talk about housework, children, finances, love language, family…” that the US S2 seems to have very little of. S1 did somewhat. Interesting","2022-02-14 00:06:43+00:00"

"6214","It’s interesting to see how other cultures date. On one hand, I find it very superficial because they focus on looks. But on the other, they’ll say stuff and it’ll have you rethinking everything about your own dating life/experiences #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-08 15:06:42+00:00"

"6221","It’s not that you didn’t match what Priya wanted but you lied about who you are. Mizuki, you are pretentious, a liar and will go broke living the way you do and I’m glad she was smart enough to get away.  #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-04 18:09:35+00:00"

"6223","It’s one thing to accommodate someone asking you to clean after yourself - that’s a hygiene thing.

It’s another thing to tell someone to change the way they speak.

"6462","Kaoru &amp; Misaki 
I’m not really feeling them, and it’s like they haven’t dived into the lovers route rather still at the friendship level. That can be helpful in the long run; yet scary;the inability to move up to the lovers level 😬

"9187","Minami &amp; Nori are probably going through some anxiety, especially the pressure of being filmed. Being exposed on a subject like love searching can be a lot. They probably want to stick through the end of the experiment. #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/hUvy4bY8d7","2022-02-16 04:32:09+00:00"

"9207","Minami is my favorite because she’s sooo herself, secure, with feelings &amp; all Mori did was criticize her.. for what?

"10947","Priya should’ve ended that convo about ownership of the business with the boss and friend once she found out he was an employee. I think it’s rude to ask this stranger “so why isn’t he financially contributing”. That’s a private conversation for her and Mizuki #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-16 14:11:12+00:00"

"10953","Priya was turned off when Mizuki ordered the expensive wine.This a def point they can use to learn more about each other.Given his past problems with debt and her experience with her father, this may be a trigger point for her and something for them to wrk thro.

"11593","So I’m finally, slowly getting back to binging HYS…and just finished episode 7, so im listening to the podcast for Ep 7…the love is blind talk😅…all the couples this season were 🥴 but anyways, I will say I watched Brazil and Japan and I enjoyed them. https://t.co/DzUSTV0DM1","2022-06-27 22:19:44+00:00"

"11596","So I’m watching love is blind Japan and these hosts facial expressions are killing me","2022-02-27 15:08:34+00:00"
"11597","So I’ve just started  #LoveIsBlindJapan is it a Japanese thing to ‘mmm’ after every sentence ? It’s really strange to me 🤣","2022-03-05 15:13:37+00:00"
"11598","So if anyone is wondering.....

"11600","So interesting how much the ages vary in Love is Blind Japan vs America","2022-03-03 22:51:13+00:00"
"11601","So interesting to watch #LoveIsBlindJapan - the convos are so wholesome in comparison to its American counterpart 🌸

Also the set and pods are built better - good quality construction from the looks of it","2022-02-17 12:19:54+00:00"
"11602","So its very hard to migrate to Australia at age 40/45. Just saying this country loves young people #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-20 10:48:38+00:00"
"11603","So Japan did their version of Love is Blind..... Why Japan? I also heard there's brazilin adaptation. The show is not that great, is actually quite stupid. If it was not about getting people married in days and only try to get people to be couples, it would have been cool.","2022-02-10 06:08:44+00:00"
"11604","So Love Is Blind Japan is my favourite version now. I'm rooting for all of them! Especially Motomi and Ryotaro. It's so wholesome!","2022-02-15 17:02:24+00:00"
"11605","so love is blind japan is proving my point huh https://t.co/GsjIYBsV3d","2022-02-09 23:34:32+00:00"

#LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/mNfbepZNFu","2022-03-07 23:38:07+00:00"
"11608","So Mizuki AND Yudai are liars #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/vsvf0UM2ym","2022-02-16 14:13:12+00:00"
"11609","So Mizuki lied to Priya about being a restaurant owner when he is really an employee #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/fJktpbPIU7","2022-02-18 22:05:54+00:00"
"11610","So Mori thinks Minami's straightforwardness and setting boundaries are quirks? Hmmm, interesting... #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-17 08:21:34+00:00"
"11611","So much more wholesome already. Perhaps this will restore my faith in humanity  #loveisblindjapan","2022-02-15 06:38:13+00:00"

"11616","So now I’m going to watch Love is Blind Japan and get Will on Audible 🤣 @MeganVWalker @LisaCrosbie","2022-03-01 08:50:11+00:00"
"11617","So one of the marked differences between #LoveIsBlindJapan and #LoveIsBlindMurica, is just how many of the couples dissolved before getting to the wedding. Season 1 of #LoveIsBlind, everyone went to the alter to give the final answer. Made for a much more dramatic series.","2022-02-23 05:37:52+00:00"
"11618","So only one couple looks like they’re definitely making it to the aisle #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-23 23:37:07+00:00"
"11619","So Priya and Mizuki are a beautiful couple!

Apparently she's half Indian half Japanese and was Miss World Japan 2016!
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-01 00:03:20+00:00"
"11620","So Priya is searching for issues because Mizuki is so nice and accommodating. I wonder why that is. Is she so used to men telling her one thing to get her and changing once they start dating?
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-05 16:21:24+00:00"
"11621","So Priya speaking about not having time to attend to her business in her personal interviews because of this experiment. And also the fact that she said she met with other women from various industries. Jeez. Was she just networking the whole time? #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-23 02:17:03+00:00"
"11622","So see to me all the women on #LoveIsBlindJapan are cute and the cutest guy to me Ryotaro is scary looking to his betrothed. I Guess for them he looks too bad boyish which is funny to me","2022-02-27 17:14:41+00:00"
"11623","So Shuntaro is being extra romantic which is not his norm style but he appreciates this is a 2nd chance for him and he doesn't want to lose Ayo...
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-05 15:12:18+00:00"
"11624","So Shuntaro owns a whole ass resort and tourist site as a home 
#LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/mE3Ojx8TKd","2022-03-13 17:40:01+00:00"
"11625","so Shuntaro, how can I contact you? 😂#loveisblindjapan","2022-02-22 20:14:00+00:00"
"11626","So Sorry Midori e Motomi eu sou exagerada quando gosto das pessoas   LOL SÉRIO NÃO LIGUEM e não se assustem 💁🏽‍♀️ 

É só amor mesmo MUITAS FELICIDADES PRA VOCÊS E LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH  #LoveIsBlind #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-07 07:22:03+00:00"
"11627","So surprised about Odochi couple 😕

Honestly being able to communicate is such a key element of relationships 
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-12 12:03:21+00:00"
"11628","Só tem mulher linda mds chocada com as deusas japonesas #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-08 19:58:54+00:00"
"11629","So the life Mizuki is outlining not only sounds outlandish to Priya but also not what he agreed to in the pods. She doesn't want to be a stay at home wife she wants a career and now it sounds like he's backtracking
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-03-08 00:06:46+00:00"
"11630","so the plan was to find a villain for this #LoveIsBlindJapan  season and y’all tried to cast Motomi ‘s dad uh ? BUT HEAR ME OUT HE WAS SO COOL yet remained true and honest !! 

he is so handsome and his outfits are LIT, and i heard he threw flowers at the end .. 🥺🥺","2022-03-01 03:50:54+00:00"
"11631","So the producers of Love Is Blind Japan do not care as much about continuity and let their cast drink from actual glasses, rather than opaque gold goblets. I prefer this.","2022-03-10 22:05:15+00:00"
"11632","So there’s a love is blind 2 and a Love is blind Japan!! im invested 😂","2022-02-16 00:25:52+00:00"
"11633","So there’s a love is blind Brazil AND Japan?!?!?!? Ik what I’m doing tn","2022-02-13 02:16:30+00:00"
"11634","so they have Love is Blind Japan… im watching ittttt🥲","2022-02-19 21:06:28+00:00"
"11635","So this dude is really assuming that after the wedding the lady will come to his house? Why not get something new together? Really old school@#loveisblindJapan","2022-02-15 20:30:54+00:00"
"11636","So this guy didn’t know he was 23 and financially insecure when he went on a get married reality show and chose a 32 year old🙄
#LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-15 23:44:02+00:00"
"11637","So this guy told her I don’t feel ready to say I do and gets upset because she didn’t express any sadness about it. Like did he want her to start sobbing and begging him to marry her. Lol #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-22 21:03:01+00:00"
"11638","So uh..who's currently obsessed with Love is Blind Japan lolll 🙋🙋🙋 ryotaro and motomi 😭😍","2022-03-07 20:36:41+00:00"
"11639","So we finally got an answer to the life long question yall, 

Yes, Asian cultures do get tattoos of words in English. 

Yudai has a tattoo that says “No Pain, No Gain” (it’s on his neck) 

#LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/YiZOLsynbT","2022-02-20 22:37:30+00:00"
"11640","So we watching love is blind Japan right 😍  its giving me my fix since Terrance house is never coming back 🥲","2022-02-26 02:07:08+00:00"
"11641","So what do you say... #LoveIsBlind finale' Block Pools anyone? C'mon, I think it'd be a lot of fun! I'm Down. The winnings would be inconceivable! #loveisblind2 #LoveIsBlindJapan #LoveIsBlindBrazil","2022-02-21 07:18:27+00:00"
"11642","So what exactly is Mori &amp; Minami's issue? Is it that he thinks she speaks in a condescending tone or she's highly critical of everything he says &amp; does?! Like, they're fighting for their lives &amp; I don't get why. 
#LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/V0xq1ObExh","2022-02-17 17:51:35+00:00"
"11643","So what I'm getting from the #LoveIsBlindJapan finale is that applications for Shuntaro's wife are open?! I call first dibs!!! https://t.co/IEuWcWV6Ij","2022-02-23 19:42:05+00:00"
"11644","SO WHAT IM HEARING IS SHUNTARO IS CURRENTLY SINGLE #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/l19zQTv78z","2022-02-22 18:27:58+00:00"
"11645","So when Mori says he wants her to support his dreams he means as a house wife? I didn't get that previously until Minami said it was important to her to keep her career and now Mori says they need to end it, then. #LoveIsBlindJapan #LoveIsBlind #ラブイズブラインドJapan","2022-02-16 04:41:51+00:00"
"11646","So while the #LoveIsBlindMurica was like, ""we'll suffer till the end!"" I feel like the #LoveIsBlindJapan had...just more respect. More respect for themselves, more respect for the idea of a relationship, for marriage. Glad they didn't try to stick it out if it wasn't right 4 them","2022-02-23 05:37:53+00:00"
"11647","So who is gonna be the one who falls in love with someone’s father on LOVE IS BLIND JAPAN….I thought that man was 38","2022-02-10 17:44:04+00:00"
"11648","So who's the priest speaking so well japanese? I'm really impressed. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-04-02 22:50:14+00:00"
"11649","So with #loveIsBlindJapan did they only show us the people who ended up choosing a partner from the very start? 🤔","2022-03-01 12:40:35+00:00"
"11650","So yudai was lyinggg #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/BaffpIo0wY","2022-02-15 22:35:56+00:00"
"11651","So Yudia is a small boy who made empty promises to Nana while in the pods, good for her for leaving #LoveIsBlindJapan https://t.co/vawIZ7VF5Y","2022-02-15 20:57:35+00:00"
"11652","So, already digging #LoveIsBlindJapan quite a bit. Good ole Asian bluntness works well in this situation. Also, the first couple to meet didn't immediately smash into each other and shove their tongues down each other's throat.","2022-03-02 17:04:50+00:00"
"11653","So, I think some of the women are being jerks, but at the same time, all the women on this show are conventionally attractive and then some, so absolutely none of these men are being challenged in any way. #LoveIsBlindJapan","2022-02-13 22:02:25+00:00"
"11654","So, I’m watching Love Is Blind - Japan. Go with me here…better Season so far than Love Is Blind-US.","2022-03-02 05:39:55+00:00"
"11655","So, the reason I watched Love is Blind Japan was if I'm going to watch this sort of thing, I should watch it from another culture's perspective. Some random observations:

1. It's interesting to see some of the western dating tropes play out the same way in a Japanese version.","2022-02-17 02:49:24+00:00"
"11656","So, watching Love is Blind Japan for research purposes of course, and I just don't think that men and women are suppose to co-exist romantically. It should really just be, ""Lets make a baby and I'll call you back.""","2022-02-18 01:59:56+00:00"
"11657","So, what’s up with Mizuki? What’s beyond his pretty face? 😅

I understand Midori and I think some of us have that fear but Wataru was patient. He allowed her to go through her feels. He waited for her to come around and accept him.
