Good job Qatar. We are getting very tired of this in the west also ! We definitely have that in common!
Genuine question. Why England teams/Fans are fine with wearing Overprized jersey made by exploited workers of Bangladesh? what stopping Harry kane and all from boycotting the team jersey
Respect Qatar ❤️
Our double standards really make us look bad.... last year, the official English football kits were being made in Bangladesh, where workers were being paid 21p per hour, and then sold for £160..... Hypocrisy, football should be separated from politics......
Football should only be about football
I think Englands football kit is made in Bangladesh we’re workers are paid 0.25 pence an hour, the kit is sold for £99 or more, that’s the hypocrisy Giani was referring to
What the hell is this world coming too?🤣 Just kick that freaking football around the pitch fellas!
Why do the players or whoever is pushing this agenda including the BBC think that their moral values should be imposed on not just a nation but a whole region? What happened to respecting your host and embracing the experience rather than being little spoiled brats and making fools of yourselves? There are far more pressing issues in the world like wars, famines and people not being able to put food on their tables because of corrupt politicians and elite bankers and everything else. Please don’t be distracted and enjoy the festivities it only comes around once in 4 years.
If your &#39;solidarity&#39; and &#39;allyship&#39; crumbles the moment you face a consequence... is your support meaningless?
Respect to Qatar for this 🇶🇦💪🏾
Good job Qatar!
I am very proud of FIFA and ather muslim countries
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 <br>love and support from Afghanistan 🇦🇫
It is like, “If we don&#39;t show our support for something far from football inside the stadium for one month, we&#39;re going to lose our minds!” What a mentality! 
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉🎈 🇶🇦 QATAR ♥️I respect you!
England showing that money is the only thing that matters 😂😂😂
&quot;the day goes by without reporting negativity and hypocrisy is the day wasted&quot; <br>- British Biased Corporation (BBC)
Can we PLEASE just play football?
At this point the world is basically &quot; I will come to your house, be naked, and call you regressive if you say no. It&#39;s my human right to be naked at your house.&quot;
good job Qatar
If England and BBC really care about LGBTQ then why don&#39;t you retrieve your teams from participating in the Qatar world cup you can do it now, 😂😂..
I absolutely hate myself for saying this and agreeing with FIFA but England are being hypocritical. This morning I would have supported England and the 8 other European countries calling FIFA&#39;s bluff by wearing the armband and threatening to pull out the tournament. Then I heard on the radio how brilliant the facilities in Qatar are. England&#39;s Lionesses travelled there in 2019 when Neville was manager for warm weather training. That just stinks.
Damn Fifa called their bluff. You wanna be a rebel you gotta pay the price or go home. Thats the way the world works.
Proves it would only ever have been a gesture. They would take the penalty gladly to bring more attention to the issues if they had any intention of initiating genuine dialogue and change. Saying that, it shouldn&#39;t be up to footballers to dictate a political agenda, they just happen to have the biggest platform.
Good job qatar 🇶🇦😍
If they were that bothered (which they probably ain&#39;t) why just boycott it?
The double standards are insane. I&#39;m pretty sure Muslim interests are not respected in the west, I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s such a problem to respect the country&#39;s customs for a little while. I&#39;ve seen people in the west being arrested just for wearing the hijab. Please don&#39;t expect for things you fail to provide yourself. The &quot;international community&#39;s&quot; established &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; doesn&#39;t speak for everyone.
good work Qatar for making them respect other countries and other cultures
No commitment and no balls - sad day when the corrupt FIFA officials who let this dodgy games go ahead blackmail National squads
No way to defend the colors Defend the colors of your country&#39;s flag<br>Whether you like it or not, you don&#39;t participate in the first place
Proud of Qatar, 👍
Don&#39;t corrupt football with immoral politics. Furthermore, respect the culture of the hosting nation. Every country has value and culture. Let it be respected. Happy footballing ⚽️.
Respect Qatar💪🇶🇦, and curse for people who say the otherwise
I love FIFA decision!...2026 world cup should organized in Qatar as well
Just Qatar been GigaChad&#39;s respect Qatar 🇶🇦❤️
Respect Qatar well  done
Yeah... I don&#39;t think that one arm band could have helped them win the match 😂
What world is this where nobody seems to want to honor British wishes.
I&#39;m tired of the act of forcing some ideas on the sports world and making a fuss by gathering friends and making problems on purpose, saying that things won&#39;t go as planned<br><br>Tolerance is not enough on the side that shouts out only diversity<br>You don&#39;t seem to understand which one is discriminatory
Money talks and Qatar has the only voice here
good job FIFA
Success is not built on success. It&#39;s built on failure, It&#39;s built on fraustration. it&#39;s built on fear that you have to overcome. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life
Very proud of Fifa!Bravo!
I love seeing the England team supporting the NHS and nurses by wearing the rainbow... Oh wait we&#39;re not doing that anymore.
Because not just in Islam in Bible we know Jesus said ; Genesis 2:21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m25s">2:25</a>, Romans 1:26-27, Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13 :) maybe they need to read that to open their eyes about LGBTq
Sport as an unifying game should be freed from politic. In the midst of these numerous of divisiveness that seem to stymie the progress of diversity, sports over decades has played a significant role in terms of coexistence as it relates to the entire human race without politic.
remember these people only love 1 thing 💰💰💰love for money is the root of all evil
So stunning, so brave 😂
How do you accept an invitation to go to someone’s home, knowing their likes and don’t likes, then feel disappointed upon arrival cuz they won’t allow the things they don’t like?…
If the culture of a sporting tournament clashes with the culture of the nation which desires to host it, then its right to do so should be forfeited...
Why wearing that one love thing if you have raheem Sterling playing 😁😁
So wearing an armband that sends a message of &quot;love and inclusion&quot; against their culture?<br>Isn&#39;t religion meant to spread love and peace?
When somebody travelling to any country has the respect the law, wherever as a present in the country, simple as that?
it&#39;s called tolerance.  we need to learn to tolerate everyone decision, if the captains don&#39;t want to take part, that is their choice and we must tolerate.  this is not a one way road, that is why the world is so fucked up.
The quote that sports and politics need to be separated is absurd in this context.
Thanks bbc for standing with lgbt and south asian migrant workers. I hope this will improve their conditions. I from india i have been listening to the bbc since i was in year ten....
They know EXACTLY what they are doing! When they say no, they want people to automatically say YES we want it, because they are being told no. The same people that cause nothing but pain and suffering, unequality, unfairness, now want One Love? Lol actions speak louder than armbands and a wink.<br>How about ACTUALLY making a difference in the world.<br>The Budweiser promotion in the &quot;look at English supporters celebrating in pubs&quot; while EVERYONE in the pubs are drinking Budweiser and cans facing the cameras lol yeah we only CARE ABOUT MONEY....sorry football.<br>One MONEY change it to.<br>Getting this whole East v West with Fifa as well, as if these things aren&#39;t planned ahead of time, speaking out against western nations, they&#39;d fear for their job, because were does the MONEY come from?<br>Yeah nice try, these games of hatred, scaremongering, racism, sexism etc etc tactics have been going on for generations, yet we are STILL hardly any further forward.<br>Money is what divides people, not armbands and set up politics beforehand to push an agenda.
Aberrant promotion is very upsetting.<br><br>The tournament is supposed to be about soccer.<br><br>Keep it that way.
Seems that giving up on their so called principles is less important than getting a yellow card. HILARIOUS!  <br>Virtue signalling.
Enjoy the games, United Nations should address that issue, keep politics away. Peace and Love
Im really enjoying Gary Lineker&#39;s monologues on MOTD because when I tune in to watch football I would rather hear about a country&#39;s appalling human rights than football . Must have been an extremely difficult decision for him to go to the tournament 🙄💰💰💰
Who actually thinks that anything will change in the middle east by bringing to the light or wearing arm bands. They don&#39;t care so can we just get back to football
We stand together....unless we get a yellow card.....pathetic
Huge W for FiFa
You can’t be a champion of something if at the first sign of resistance you fold. It just goes to show you never really cared and that you only did what you did to look like the good guy. Kind of embarrassing and disgraceful to be honest.
Human nature today is such, if you want to do something good, you want to do it when publicity is available and your image is not at stake. Otherwise you will not do it.
Wow:( I wish the players would boycott this game. Decided in 2010 that in 2022 Qatar would be the place this games gonna take place in:(
They’re guests in there country, they should be respectful of their culture, and not act with a political agenda
I can&#39;t believe it. It’s hit me quite hard this… after all this time the person who cares the most about gay rights in the country ….. is me. And I haven&#39;t given one thought to gay rights in the last 32 years of my life on earth...<br><br>But I decided to boycott watching this world cup because of human rights, combined with the ridiculousness of a winter break. <br><br>And all this time, as I&#39;ve see people on social media share rainbow, black flags, women&#39;s equality infographics ... and they&#39;ve all gone to watch the World cup while I&#39;m sat in the office. It turns out they never cared, Harry Kane never cared, Gary Lineker never cared. What a weird revelation for me today.
Armbands are just ridiculous. Achieves nothing at all. Just a way of saying look at me caring when in fact you’re doing nothing.
well done FIFA 💎❤️💖watch football enjoy the game and go home, learn to respect others&#39; culture....what&#39;s the point of going around and telling people I&#39;m straight or otherwise?! enough with the provocations, we come for the game not your stupid show of sexual orientation, keep it to yourself !!!! Like there is nothing else for you to boast about....shame
Yeah if Kane got a second yellow then the England fans would turn on him like they did to Beckham just giving him death threats and abuse for a few years.
This entire tournament is a good example of greed and corruption . And in plain view of everyone to see
I am very happy that I enjoyed football in the 90&#39;s<br>Only football is not politics. Do not plant these ideas in the heads of our children and youth<br>And just so you know, it is also forbidden in the Bible
This is Doha Qatar not Londonistan! You expect to impose your culture on people who don&#39;t want it? They risk deportation if they politicise the cup
Frustration without action is just apathy.<br><br>saying you&#39;re frustrated without actually showing it means nothing. speech is meaningless unless followed through with swift decisive action.
when will woke westerners realise that their values aren&#39;t universal. there are other cultures with DIFFERENT values that should equally be respected.  lets not forget that the west is not the spokesperson for humanity.  huge respect to Qatar for not bending the knee to woke progressive western imperialism. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23westandwithqatar">#westandwithQatar</a> 🇶🇦🇶🇦🇶🇦
LMFAO 🤣 🤣 🤣,  I&#39;m truly surprised that NO ONE has mentioned the loss of needed money to boost our economy. Pubs and shops would be booming with business if the World Cup was held in the summer, rather than winter in an oil rich country. Imagine all the local pubs raking in the money? We wouldn&#39;t be in this Shitmas hell that we&#39;re in now.
Just learn to respect different cultures. I know that it is hard for colonial mind, but try.
Ditch the armbands and don&#39;t take the knee.<br>None of that nonsense belongs in sport, period!
Update. No captains or teams will wear it or uniforms that display the &quot;Pride&quot; flag because of Qatari law. It&#39;s fantastic news, play ball without the condescending politics
Western people need to learn respect to other people culture
Lol, BBC should Cry louder. How will you survive this 😂.
I love the rainbow colour back then. But nowadays its like agenda stuffing to my throat.
When England get kicked out the world let&#39;s hope they wear the armband on the way home 😆
Maybe wales, england need to concentrate on playing football not woke politics, probably win more games.
Generally id say keep politics out of football. But here I see a clear lack of spine from FIFA. Change your political stance as per the money that comes in🤣🤣<br>Pretty sure in other events FIFA will force players to take a knee and wear the armband. Zero consistency in FIFA
Leave political ideas <br>All culture have did values <br>Respect to Qatar for not changing thier rules due to western ppl crying
Western countries should withdraw their teams!
Respect others if you want to be respect.
What on earth does one&#39;s sexuality have to do with football!!?? Stop politicising your sexual preference. I&#39;m sick of hearing about this. I love football. I don&#39;t care about what you do in your bedroom.   Wearing flags that represent sexuality should have nothing to do with the world cup. It&#39;s once every 4 years. Keep sex out of this. It&#39;s private and personal and everyone is fed up with it being forced onto them
The more they cry, the more we feel happy and fulfilled !!
From not showing the opening ceremony on the BBC now they want to talk about arm bands. Tax payers money to good use,lol
Can we now just get on with the football please? All the virtue signalling BS is out the window.<br><br>Seven High profile countries wearing the armbands and taking the penalty be that a yellow card or whatever would have been a huge gesture. .....
Ok now i have to visit Germany to teach how to play with football.... 😎
It&#39;s just pathetic, both from FIFA and from the teams. If wearing the armband is so important to the players, they should wear it regardless of the disciplinary actions.
One love Japan !!
Politics should have nothing to do with football. Keep your culture to yourselves.
1 guy on the team would get a warning card. That&#39;s all it takes to make Europeans fold? 😂
a day without hypocrisy is a day wasted <br>-the west
World football is confused by LGBT, name a religion that allows homosexuality? If all religions forbid how we think this is a right
We should satire back with the captain&#39;s armband (( NAZI )) and((HITLER POSE))<br>You are always racist towards Muslims, blacks and Chinese/Asian.
Great ! This Hipócritas want to make people to submit to their demand.. they can Care less about Love .. there&#39;s no such of thing as &#39;One&#39; love ! And love it&#39;s not a demand! How the heck anyone have the Audacity to demand people to wear &#39;One Love&#39;s ? Like people are obligated to love you back 😂😂😂 you can&#39;t make this stuff up
🖕🏳️‍🌈🖕🏳️‍🌈🖕🏳️‍🌈🖕🏳️‍🌈
Respect Qatar ❤️
Because not just in Islam in Bible we know Jesus said ; Genesis 2:21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m22s">2:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m23s">2:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m24s">2:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHIDNOCJq4&amp;t=2m25s">2:25</a>, Romans 1:26-27, Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13 :) maybe they need to read that to open their eyes about LGBTq
LGBTQM need to be stopped!!!  Gays need to be stopped!!!!  It&#39;s been out of control for too long already.  ...In the UK, the un-normal is you who are straight.
LGBT Rainbow Flag😂😂😂,,, the colors of the rainbow are not the same.... LGBT people are a bit sleep deprived😂😂. . .
I love the rainbow colour back then. But nowadays its like agenda stuffing to my throat.
Western people need to learn respect to other people culture
Just Qatar been GigaChad&#39;s respect Qatar 🇶🇦❤️

Ect..) with them , these   stupid western , the western liberals of course with my respect to the others western who are against this sick and Disgusting things (I know many of them against that and against this sick new liberals ideology  ) , and yeah 99,99 % in our society we don&#39;t accept this sick  things that you have in the West ,, how much you have now 5 or 6 genders, man change his sex to the woman, and women change her sex to the man, and you confuse in relationship like a man, you are in relationship with a girlfriend or boyfriend ? stupid western ? , make it for yourself, we don&#39;t need that , and make it your disgusting things in your private room, it&#39;s not my business, I don&#39;t care even if you sleep with your monkey in your private room , but in society or you show me ect... Or activities, or we see a rainbow or a flag  or anything we see it in society or media ect.... Is another thing,, don&#39;t show me, why you  should to show me at all?,, in your private room and when I don&#39;t see you, even if you sleep with your monkey, I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s not my business , but in society or we see you  or you try activities or something like that ect... .like you have in west society, there are no respect in society and the notion of family ect... .... you see the people before even the gouvernement take care of you, don&#39;t challenge us, stupid western, we don&#39;t accept this sick things in our society, it&#39;s something very important for us the notion of family. We are not like you, you don&#39;t have any  notion of family in your society, make it for yourself like a Western, or make it for your private room with  yourself, and  dont show me, if you show me there are a concequence, people here don&#39;t accept that before even their gouvernment, don&#39;t show me, why you should to show me at all you are gay  in society , it&#39;s not my business your private room when I don&#39;t see you it&#39;s not my business , but the society or when I see you is another thing, it&#39;s became my business, yeah , easy and simple and directly
Pansies - guess the cause wasn’t that important to them
I&#39;m a muslim, and of course I&#39;m used to be anti lgbt by the rules of Islam, because it logically damaging and harming generations by make the regeneration or reproduction stopped. If there&#39;s lgbt, it means zero possibility of babies newborn. And if there&#39;s no more newborn baby, then who will become the next generation? It clear enough that lgbt is haram, it&#39;s so wrong.<br>But, killing other God&#39;s creature depends on they are wrong doers is absolutely wrong, because there&#39;s so many better way to educate the wrong doers to be good doers, it called taubat, it called hidayah.<br>Islam teach harmony, sovereignty and peaceful with something called: Patience. That&#39;s Prophet Muhammad teaches muslim to be a good muslim, not to be a radical muslim.<br>We, ummat Islam known better our religion than those islamophobe around this world, even when they&#39;re about suggesting this world with some amoral things like lgbt, that&#39;s fine, everything human do will be retained after, sooner or later. Payback, not from human but from universe&#39;s Creator, from Allah Azza Wajalla.<br>If you don&#39;t like Islam rule, just shut up and don&#39;t do anything nor write nor make a statement that you don&#39;t know anything about Islam. Respect whenever you at, respect their culture, if you can respect others culture in their country and religion: that&#39;s called HUMANITY.<br>Subhanallah walhamdulillah walaa ilaa ha illallahu Allahu Akbar ❤️
Qatar good job
I dont get it. Everyone knows it is not normal. It is morally and biologically wrong. Just plain wrong. It amplifies sexual disease n it affects the mind and moral of younger generations. I guess all these westerners are planning to bring back the culture and lifestyle of the roman empire. Sad to see the more modern our mind is the more backwards we re trying to b.
Fun fact polygamy is illegal in the UK. If the World Cup was in England and people of muslim faith wanted to wear red or blue armbands for their right to marry multiple women would the English media kick up a fuss? No shut up with the propaganda get on with the laws of a country and just enjoy the football. Leave the politics out if you can only spout rhetoric on why the west is correct
i&#39;m so sick and tired of that alphabet society and all that agenda... ugh.
<br>It is necessary to respect other cultures and traditions. Do not promote your stinking homosexual traditions where they are not needed.aditions of the owners of the house. All because of rudeness, impudence, impunity.
Don&#39;t pay your tv licence fee it&#39;s your money and they just what it.
They really are forcing this woke agenda on us and making anyone that refuses it is targeted as a bad person??
the MAIN REASON here in my country are the THOUSANDS OF DEAD WORKERS! you lituarally play on graves, thats fact. you party on their graves! never forget that! <br><br>64 games 8 stadiums. 64:8 = 8<br>only 8 games in every stadium and thats it, then they are useless. build up with blood of thousands because of only 8 games.... wow... 👏<br><br>I am from an european football country and in past I ever watched world cup, ever with joy. but this time I will NOT watch a single game, even from my country I will NOT watch! first time in my life. and many many of my friends and colleagues dont watch wc too.<br><br>FIFA destroyed everything for what football stands, in my opinion you can quit wc because the win is nothing worth this time, NOTHING. facts
Very proud of Fifa!Bravo!
The woke mob want to ruin every damn thing for everyone.
Boycott..bbc
John&#39;s now a news reporter? 🙄 what about Sherlock?
Good qatar
Promote your fealty dirty immortal against human nature at home not in Qatar ,,,
FIFA only honors bloody oil money.
I support Qatar
Enjoy the games, United Nations should address that issue, keep politics away. Peace and Love
Good on Qatar! Sick of this woke nonsense. We have lost our minds in the collective West from a Englishman
I love seeing the England team supporting the NHS and nurses by wearing the rainbow... Oh wait we&#39;re not doing that anymore.
Proud of Qatar, 👍
Keep your Filth on your side of the World and don&#39;t impose it on others .
Respect others if you want to be respect.
Maybe wales, england need to concentrate on playing football not woke politics, probably win more games.
Please someone wear Hitler nazi costume western will understand that everything they define always not a correct.
I agree that Qatar prohibits homosexuality, because not only Qatar, every Muslim country prohibits it because it is not a human command but Allah Almighty. if you don&#39;t ban it, the punishment will befall a country, for example, the city of Pompeii due to himosexsual. homosexual is a deviant act that is a disorder.
Good, the man is created for woman and vice versa, like adam is created only for hawa, we know its normal as human being
Lol! This rainbow news is more important to bbc than Fatoumatta Hydara and her 2 infants who were roasted to dead in Nottingham by some racist geezer
Slava Qatar
Sick and tired of this crap. We are also tired of this in the west. It’s just the media that isn’t
good work Qatar for making them respect other countries and other cultures

Bro , if you can&#39;t follow the rules here . Then go back to your own country stupid 😂 how about that ?
I am very happy that I enjoyed football in the 90&#39;s<br>Only football is not politics. Do not plant these ideas in the heads of our children and youth<br>And just so you know, it is also forbidden in the Bible
money is all that matters isnt it? Shit country, shit leaders, shit religion.
Fifa is a fake double standard association. They are willing to sanction Mexicans for yelling a homofobic slur but they will not allow captains wear a band supporting the LGBTQ community???? So WTF???? All of this =$$$$$!!!
Ghor e giye pod maramari kor
Boycott England
Make them disappear from the world. And please stop adopted the children not knowing they parents not normal. You guys robbed the children from a better life. I believe some of them just using by lgbtq as a toys. Before you say or keep talking about human rights please protect the children from lgbtq parents. They don&#39;t need the types of family. Save children as a toys from them. And BCC fake news always come out. Okay, karma will hunting you in a real life. BS BCC news. America never be great😎
5 people killed in shooting at LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado : People killed by &quot;non terrorist American&quot; will England and all other teams will boycott playing with USA in Qatar , out of solidarity with LGBTQ+ community ??? or they only like the money they are getting from them to raise their flag ??? Here I see, Just-Us NOT Justice.  So so sorry for the loss of lives at that club, condolences to their families.
How does this minorty small group control the world?
No problem with the 6500 dead workers for this circus, shame on England !!
One love Japan !!
Imagine how much more money they make if they’d just shut up and play really they shouldn’t have any support for anything not even blm it should just be football
Woke football team should kneel for god not goverment agendas or dirty old men in dresses
Europeans in general, Westerners, do not respect the laws of Arab countries. Is this racism, or are you people who do not have the manners, respect and masculinity? Indeed, homosexuals are not embarrassed, disgraceful, provocative, disrespectful, shameful and disgraceful to all of you.. 👎👎👎
arouse disgust 💩🇩🇪
Yeah... I don&#39;t think that one arm band could have helped them win the match 😂
Football is football, not for political gender issues
Im pretty sure your sexual views have nothing to do with football. Football is not about sex or gender identity.
too much politics...bbc sold as a biased media...eng puppy...hatred for not getting world cup hosting rights...although qatar is no saint
Whity pple you got learn to respect other values. Your values keep them in your border and don’t enforcing your values which is considered terrorism.
Respect Qatar well  done
Ready to do anything to make people forget the past, it&#39;s pathetic
Ok now i have to visit Germany to teach how to play with football.... 😎
Don&#39;t corrupt football with immoral politics. Furthermore, respect the culture of the hosting nation. Every country has value and culture. Let it be respected. Happy footballing ⚽️.
Qatar 🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍
The west should respect other nations values and cultures. Just because you are free to express your homosexuality (publicly) in your country, does not mean that you have the same space of freedom in other countries where homosexuality  is considered as a taboo.
dont spread those worst desease among us..just keep it to yours..
does the lgbtq community even want this or is this an agenda by the elite to divide us again. if japan was hosting the world cup and they didn&#39;t accept this we would all bow down and accept it. But oh no a Muslim country is backwards for not accepting gay rights. islam does not bend to anyone. It is meant to be the message straight from god. Just because the west chose to change the rules in Christianity and allow for gay rights doesnt mean Islam. let me remind you if you were gay in the west a few years ago you were sent to a mental institution. qatar isn&#39;t even banning gay people it is simply saying it wont allow public affection even if you are straight the fact western media is not respecting the laws of the land of another nation shows you how backwards they are. This is not about gay rights or the bribes or the imgraten workers. this is about divide and conquer. Imagine the west and middle east uniting as one human race nope doesnt work for the 1 percent billionaires. this ain&#39;t about religion or race this is about making sure you follow the narrative that Muslim are terrorists not humans that like to have fun and play football
Let’s wear arm bands for every cause in the world lol forget football let’s support and promote everything instead and just wear bands all over our body lol
when will woke westerners realise that their values aren&#39;t universal. there are other cultures with DIFFERENT values that should equally be respected.  lets not forget that the west is not the spokesperson for humanity.  huge respect to Qatar for not bending the knee to woke progressive western imperialism. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23westandwithqatar">#westandwithQatar</a> 🇶🇦🇶🇦🇶🇦
Good Job Qatar, even British don&#39;t like that attitude..
Why wearing that one love thing if you have raheem Sterling playing 😁😁
Double standards of the west at it&#39;s best. What a bunch of hypocrites. Wear what ever you want at your country, respect the laws of the hosting country. The west think that all the world should think like them.
double standard
Commend your Qatar...❣
In the end message means nothing compares to $$$$
Respect for Qatar for disallowed LGBTQ flags
Good, the  World Cup is about a celebration of futbol, not woke nonsense.
