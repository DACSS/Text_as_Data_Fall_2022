"Andrikopoulou et al., 2013",Discover the consistency of vulvar dimension reporting in gynecology textbooks,"All gynecology and anatomy textbooks in select Universities of the London area was performed, as well as review of syllabi of undergrads. Vulval pathology textbooks were omitted.",Dimensions of vulval structures and vagina were recorded as well as illustration types.,"Gynecology textbooks tended to have more information, and only gynecology books had measurements. These measurements were primarily taken decades ago. Authors feel as though without literature for physicians to rely on, they may turn to personal experiences instead. Did not discuss bias.",I read this to review their data selection methods and see how they processed their data. This made me think that I would like to see if measurements are reported for vaginas in comparison to penises.
Berotti & Miner 2021,Reviewing gynecology materials suggested by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to assess bias in reporting contraceptive’s risk,Took 15 top materials recommended by ACOG and 15 top gynecology books (same method as Berotti & Miner 2019).,"Applied Critical Discourse Analysis to the texts, which is done by hand. This helps researchers identify areas of bias in texts, especially if they’re framed as impartial.","Pharmacological contraceptives are framed as safe as compared to the lifestyle choices and bodies of women. The effectiveness is valued more than the autonomy of the person using it, and side effects are seen as minimal in this light.","I read this because I was interested in CDA and how they processed text. From my brief search, there are few articles that combine CDA and NLP. Given more time, it would be interesting to perform this type of analysis on my data."
"Gwan et al., 2022",Compare skin tone representation of vulvar conditions,"Chose most widely used OBG textbooks available through university, and confirmed with medical school faculty of their relevance",Authors employed volunteers to review skin tones based on the Fitzpatrick Scale,Darker skin tones represented more pathologic vulvar conditions. This was especially significant in textbooks for residents,"I read this to see their methods. The authors say that because these textbooks are well known and used across many institutions, they don’t consider this a potential for bias. I like that they validated the use of these books with faculty, which (if I am doing a larger project) I would like to do."
"Whalen, 2005",Develop a method for summarizing medical textbook and encyclopedias automatically,Uses sources in the Columbia University Health Sciences Library and Harrison’s Online.,"Utilizes Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) which is a database of medical language for NLP. They also make use of MetaMap, which is used for tagging parts of speech while also using UMLS and other programs. Whalen uses these resources while developing an algorithm.",Summaries are clustered according to a user’s search term and the algorithm is promising for future study.,"I read this to see ways that medical texts can be processed. I didn’t know about UMLS, I will look into whether or not R has any packages available in this regard."
"Yacob et al., 2020","Compare readability and reliability of wikipedia vs medical textbooks, as physicians frequently reference both",Used Qualifying Exam topics for vascular surgery as ways to choose Wikipedia articles and Schwart’s Principles of Surgeries which is a well known textbook,"Assess readability using Flesch Reading Ease score along with Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level system among others. DISCERN was used to evaluate the quality and completeness of the articles, which is manually done.","Wikipedia was more readable compared to the textbook, but had higher rates of omission and lower quality grades.","I read this to see methods of how they chose their texts and how they processed them. This gave me an idea that I could potentially look at change in readability over time. “Womanhood” and topics related to sex were considered mysterious, so I wonder if this would translate in language difficulty."
