I’ll try to get the next video essay out in less than a month lol
Bullshit the lgbtq rule is perfect....the homophobic should start everywhere
Disgrace?? You forgot that Microsoft used kids. And alot of countries do the same
The fact that these large stadium will be rendered into haunting vast arenas once the world cup is finished makes me sick.<br>Basically, their plan is to build the stadiums by paying minimal amount, suck up all the profits and then render them useless.
Before world cup in Qatar must give nationalities to there foreign residents.
Maqwell I’m new to your channel and think you mean well, but you cannot criticize a country where it’s laws go off the religion bc of your own beliefs. That’s wrong. That doesn’t make this country evil because the religion does not allow same sex marriage or relationships. It sounds very ignorant of you to make that a reason why this World Cup is tainted. If someone is gay in a place where it’s accepted, that’s fine! You don’t have to try to prove a point by going to a land where their culture and laws are different and claim them to be evil. Respect the laws of countries and respect the religion, do better.
Human rights matters
We supporters don&#39;t have a voice or deciding vote in any of this, however we can protest with the withdrawal of our attention and our money. Enough boycotts might be the only thing would prevent situations like these happening again. Engagement with WC content only abets it.
The nonchalance the foremen and managers show toward the workers&#39; deaths and mistreatment is genuinely chilling.
Educate yourself in basic cyber security and private the fuck out of the wc streams if you love football and want to reduce corruption. It the corrupt where it hurts.
Stupid double standards, No one said anything when Russia hosted it in 2018. And no one said anything either when the US hosted it.
Disgusting how some of the small comments call it Islamophobia when we are calling out their crimes against humanity
Saving my money for 2026 quatar has made this World Cup into something is wasn’t meant to be
Asian lord farquaad speaking<br>Islamophobia
The hate for arab countries is insane among westerns....<br>When your entire history is bloody...
Islamophobia!
Thanks bro for this documentary. Really, noone ever mentioned something, yea just out of a desert an stadium comes out with noone dead on 50C degrees. I feel sad that poor workers needed to die, so the Ritch Arabs can make the poor Arabs proud in the eyes of their western colonialists. Sad
Came back here after watching Gary Neville&#39;s second Qatar Overlap. Needed to watch something a little less biased.
You know that it&#39;s a huge lie when they said that +3000 of construction workers died while building the world cup stadiums, they are just jealous let them hate if they really care about human right Danmark should&#39;ve speak about The China genocide against the Uyghurs and the Palestinian cause etc... But they are only here to accuse Qatar because of the death of the 3 workers and we know that construction worker deaths are common so why all this attack on Qatar?
I wonder how much Sepp Blatter (and FIFA)  got paid to give the win to Qatar?<br><br>The slave labour they used to get those stadiums built is horrendous. I can&#39;t believe that the western world continues to turn a blind eye to the labour abuses in the Middle East (GCC).<br><br>Every bad thing Maxwell said here - IS TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br><br>And you know what they say about accommodations and salary? - They don&#39;t have it as good back home. IMAGINE THE INHUMANITY!!!!!!! WAKE UP WESTERN WORLD!
FIFA has PROVEN history of corruption and even the village idiot would be suspicious of this venue for a world cup for gods sake. So who will be investigating this?? They even had to change the time of year for the event because the ones making the deal were so excited about the cash they would receive they forgot about the bloody obvious heat problem.
Listen about the gay lgbt laws. This is more about relegion than hatered , we wont change our relegion for a football match.
you dont like that the UAE banned the lgbtq? leave and go elsewhere where its ok. No money? Well survive first before worrying anything else
the fans willingness to still watch is what fuelled all of that
tbh you cant really blame Qatar for the LGBTQ+ rules cause Qatar is an islamic country and in islam LGBTQ+ isnt allowed sooo yeah
stop the hate, qatar will  organize the world best world cup ever. mark my word, stop the hate you haters.
I didn’t know this actually. As a Bangladeshi I, I hope something changes and these pieces of shits get what they deserve, but it doesn’t seem so, because of all the other scums in the world
for the &quot;slavery&quot; that you are accusing them isn&#39;t fully true. I will talk about my country Kuwait not Qatar, it is also in the middle east. Out of all these accusations that you are saying in your life I haven&#39;t seen a SINGLE one in my country like the fake contracts. Yes they do work very hard jobs with low salary but there is an agreement before that and none of the people I witnessed work have been manipulated like you are saying. Sure they might happen but that&#39;s VERY rare. Calling it slavery is very crazy though.
ههههه شكله نسي الغرب شو عمل و لسا بعمل في البشر. نفاق قوي
Aren’t you embarrassed of yourself lmao, when FIFA was hosted in Brazil, Russia etc many innocent construction workers have tragically died building stadiums, but no one complained, let me guess why cause it’s not a Muslim, Rich, Arab country. However, when Qatar does it, everyone suddenly acts like they care about the lives that were lost. Sounds like you’re just jealous, u stay mad while we have fun babes 🔥🔥🔥🇶🇦🇶🇦
We all know it&#39;s a joke. Do not go
the world cup is a trophy that everyone likes and that&#39;s why it is called the world cup because all humans enjoy it, but if it is like this it becomes an irony, I mean we don&#39;t want to be happy over other people&#39;s suffering
I was Rewatching this again and it reminded that humanity is scary like shivering scary but I also recommended this to people who watch football and ask me “why is the World Cup in the Fall/Winter” and just like me , they were all in awe. Man the BGM you chose made the video eerie but it was perfect for what you were conveying.
A golden opportunity to combat negative stereotypes... used to make them worse.
fifa was alleyways corrupt wants new
@maqwell we can do something. We can stop watching.
all good but dont force your lgbt stuff on another country lol
Well When You make someone who just pulls out Hot and cold balls for fixed Draws in ucl this is liable to happen
should’ve been usa. already have the resources the stadiums esp and the hotels. everything is literally set. no abusing of workers like some of these countries do smh.
omg Bangladesh mentioned
Fifa ended slavery fr😂
Concerning homosexuality you have to know it&#39;s a religious concept you have to respect , God created us - as well as all other living creatures- in two sexes , males and females , and God made this the way of reserving all humans by having children and generations that replace generations . Gayism ain&#39;t gonna serve this simple aim , neither for humans nor animals even , that&#39;s why we call it &quot;anti-intrinsic&quot; .<br><br>Finally , for you that&#39;s reading , believe me , I didn&#39;t write this to attack or to make controversy , maybe you&#39;ve just heard this for the first time , but think about it , you&#39;ve been given this life , and suddenly , at any time , you can lose it ! Who is the one that give you this life , and will take it from you ? How this life is designed ? And what you are required to do ? And what you are prohibited of ? , THINK about it .<br><br>Thank you . ♥️
Very efficient documentary. You are speaking too fast and must vary your intonation to emphasize the most important facts.
Cry about it <br>At the end it y’all will pay your money to travel to qatar 😂<br>Proud of this country
I don&#39;t understand why FIFA would do the world cup in Qatar, out of all the other countries you can choose.. They choose the middle east
Curacao vs indonesia on the 24th
Chad Qatar : Bribes Virgin West to submission. Humiliaties the West. Doesn&#39;t care about stupid lgbt flag. Profits
For any Western fans attending, It will be a nightmare. Boozeless brutality. I&#39;m saving my cash for 2026.
I think all middle eastern countries are similar to Qatar like the UAE (yes that country everyone loves but still has unpaid migrant workers) Saudi Oman etc. but we have to remember these migrant workers are living in poverty already. as a former resident in Qatar i can say its not modern living conditions but is still better from what they are brought up in every worker gets a phone,car,accommodation (not the nicest but still accommodation) this is way more than they are used to please don’t go after me if you disagree I just have an opinion 🙂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_m7_rrTSxI&amp;t=10m27s">10:27</a> lmao what
Whaat??? An American person calls football &quot;football&quot; instead of &quot;soccer&quot;??? Damn, amazing
I&#39;m so glad the comments have not disintegrated into whataboutery.
A the winners are: Mr Platini and Blatter for gross corruption, dishonesty for the$100 million bribe and responsibility for 6k workers deaths building 6 stadiums...
I hate how people think that lgbtq+ is a normal thing, it is literally against the nature of humans. I am with Qatar&#39;s laws of anti-lgbtq+ and support these laws !
Came here for the info, stayed for the Earthbound music
You completely omitted the environmental impact aspect, an extremely important one
thank you for your research!
This (and similar content) should really have more views!
W qatar
I hope countries that qualified that have a high amount of migrant workers that died in qatar troll this world cup.
you know what ... west has beaten in their own game, which is &quot;bribe works&quot;. who cares about &quot;slave labour of qatar&quot;? england hosted euro while bombing iraq ... nobody cared about that back then. simply, we all know that organising world cup or euro brings a lot money which westerners always want for themselves.
Simply disgusting! I hope a lot of people will boycott this, because  we have more power than we think. Please don‘t support this disgraceful garbage.
God how I love countries like Qatar
Its not just Qatar, its the story of almost every Arab country. Dubai is a prime example
Boycott the WC???
Hypocrisy of the west. Imagine bringing out the west&#39;s dirty laundry everytime they have their Superbowl.
I just want to say that the creator, it is your job to create the videos but I would like to pray for your success and your family may god bless you. Thank you soo much for making time to do research and making this video. My people from nepal and the people of my neighbouring countries INDIA, BANGLADESH, PAKISTAN AND SRILANKA they died for Qatar&#39;s fantasies.
I am native qatari
and then the west talk so much about China treating Uighurs harshly.... yet mention not about this...
Lmao this guy is criticizing western media for not standing for human rights! Did you forget the last 50 years of targeted vilified hate against &quot;iraq, iran, libia, Afghanistan, syria, russia, Saudi arabia&quot; from the same so-called media? 🙄
if an arab country does it yall go crazy but if Germany or Russia does it yall stay quiet
I cannot believe FIFA chose Qatar for a World Cup! Knowing how this country is hypersensitive with their outrages rules, it&#39;s not worth going.  I know as a Latin we like to PARTY🎉,🍻 DANCE, SING LOUDLY🎊, MAKE JOKES, and DRINK! Any little thing they they see wrong, we will be subject to jail or fines! Nuh Huh I&#39;ll watch it from home!
Ok
There are lots of in the Middle East that have lots of tourists such as Saudi Arabia and emeritus and these countries should get the World Cup instead of qatar
Don&#39;t mess with the USA lol they unleashed agencies on these people 🤣
The video is good AND true BUT I really don’t agree with the hate not love because in islam lgbtq is haram and if someone supports it in islam he’s basically not Muslim death punishment is not true but definitely a loooooong time in prison for it and as a Muslim I really don’t have any sympathy for Muslims apart of the lgbtq
now do the same when US host a worldwide event lol
Chad Qatar.<br>No normal human being wants that rainbow flag lol.<br>No normal human being is attracted to the same gender.<br>Period.
That&#39;s why i don&#39;t support or endorse international sporting organizations, barr one. The only decent international sporting organisation is the WTA. The IOC is just as corrupt and compromised as FIFA. Why deep investigation is not done on these organisations, and prominent individuals in these organisations, is beyond me.
God bless arabs 🐐from morocco to saudi arabia
There will never be another World Cup hosted by an Arab nation. It was a mistake to reward this country a World Cup. Never again.
Screw fifa I hate them now I love soccer but not fifa soccer.
A proper research and dedication can seen on this video👍🏻 Thanks for covering this topic as this has to be viral all over the world. I am from Nepal and i saw more than 3/4 coffins are arriving Nepalese Airport from Middle east countries and out of four, 3 bodies are come from Qatar
Yeah and we forgot the western racism and slavery over the past 100 years
It&#39;s their religion
All this jst for barely 2 months of football. When it could be played elsewhere that already had the foundations of football built.
As much as this whole situation is fucked up,it&#39;s important to note that it has happened a lot of times(not as an excuse for Qatar), it&#39;s also hypocritical to say these things while we are using our phones,wearing our nike clothes and driving our cars which are all from slavery,bottom line is the world is a fucked up place we just have to go with situations where positives outweigh the negatives which the Qatar world cup doesn&#39;t,so watching it will be a very hard thing. But at the end of the day we are the pawns of these huge companies
100 days to go for fifa in qatar - gay friendly and labor friendly country <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whataworldwelivein">#whataworldwelivein</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottqatar">#boycottqatar</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23playinbloodofworkers">#playinbloodofworkers</a>
The world Cup in Qatar is a disaster 😑
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_m7_rrTSxI&amp;t=15m21s">15:21</a> its part of their religion deal with it
I agree with you in every issue but the LGBTQ issue is irrelevant to the World Cup and is just something the west is trying to push on us even though its not in our culture, beliefs and laws.
you&#39;d have a field day investigating corruption in south american football
Senegal is going to win the World Cup
Im glad someone made a vid about this, I lived in Doha for 8 years and recently left back to my country. Whenever I would go home from school you could see workers being forced to work in the summers peak temp hour even though it was made illegal to work from 12pm to 4pm or something like that? Theres also a huge lack of safety, cranes with cargo would be moved OVER MOVING TRAFFIC:<br><br>To any adults who plan to go to the world cup I will tell you now that many places in Qatar will not serve alchoholic drinks because they need a license and can only purchase their alchohol from QDC. So if you do want alchohol I&#39;d reccommend going to a hotel like the Grand Hyatt or something. So don&#39;t get upset if ya cant find a place to get beer. (but in the stadium there  will be alchohol drinking zones).
Fuck off with your lgtv shit
Thank god for the bbc
This video essay is exactly what the world needs. Super informative, clear and well structured. I especially like the afterword — which opens up the idea that being mindful of the federations/corporations/institutions we support and oppose, can prevent future corrupt operations and save future migrant worker lives.<br><br>That being said, as video essay, your points would be even stronger if you left your sources as an appendix either in the description or throughout the video ;)
Workers rights should have been a pre requisite to placing a tender and a template of the employment contracts should have been submitted as part of the bid
The same situation exists in other countries.  I have a PhD and I work in the UK with a skilled worker visa.  I only have the right to work for my sponsor and if I get fired I have to leave the country within a few weeks.  It is also written in my residence permit card that I am deprived of all government support.  Is this not slavery?  Which idiots run this government?  My sponsor is a Chinese state-owned company.  It means that the British government has forced me to work for the Chinese government like a slave and I am deprived of all rights.  My life here was wasted with this slavery and I could not implement the ideas I had because everything is forbidden to me and I only have to work for the Chinese government and I have to fear the discriminatory and very anti-foreigner and brutal laws of the UK government.  Shut up and don&#39;t talk about human rights, you bastards
Like how my people’s say “the fifa is all mafia”
