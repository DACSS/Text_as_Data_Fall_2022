i
I was there  for almost 4yrs. And all i can say is he is telling the truth
Qatar will eventually be Punished by God for their Ill treatment of Labourers ( Treating them as prisoners of the Country ) and they Will Repent upon their deeds and then they will realise what they had done with them( Labourers) <br><br>God is One .
6 1/2 Thousand Lives just to put on a soccer game, how inhumane is that
Definitely slavery. Unbelievable this is happening in 2022
For the migrants in qatar form riots also to their cities just like what their fellow middle easterners are currently doing in Europe
Give quatar a sunction if they don&#39;t comply despite of international criticism
Why they don&#39;t say &quot;thanks to God we let starving thousands of workers?&quot;
The employers are European Companies so why are they not mentioned on this anti Muslim channel (France 24). <br>Shouldn‚Äôt these European Companies be held to accountability for slave labour and human rights abuses. <br>As a news channel supposedly caring for the migrant workers why not name the western companies that employ these migrant workers. <br>It‚Äôs the western regime‚Äôs and the public should understand why they are always interfering in muslim countries and trying to paint a bad image of Qatar and other Muslim countries.
how did a country that doesn&#39;t have basic standards for workers get to host a glossy world cup , as a fa√ßade to show the world how rich and developed they are. I ve heard these migrant workers are currently trapped in an industrial zone in south west Doha , being kept far away from the World Cup so that no media find them and discover the true extent of their suffering
Culture, real binding with religion, knowledge  from and about the Human Norms and Values are really decisive how people behave, treat  and approach  others.<br><br>!!!!!!
U‚Äôll never see Al-Jazeera Covering this! ü§£
Yes, there is room for improvement there always is, considering the fact that there are  way more employees than the actual population of Qatar,it  seems to be impossible to give everyone qarari nationality. They need more and more workers as they are an ambitious Nation Europeans and Americans can make it possible because they are large  Nations and they can contribute themselves into the progress of their countries I have soft corner for the employees there including my fellow nationals.hop for the best in coming years.peace...!
I worked in Qatar 5 yrs and I can relate.
Many immigrants die in France too
I cant understan why if thats all right no one went to their embassy to report it... im from kuwait and so many workers say the same thing about my country yet no is going back.. all that complain is for their visa they want a way to get in the country so they sign to anything get in by visa 20 and run away after a week becuse what they really want is visa 18 wich is completly diffrent ... i paid almost 10.000 us dollar to bring a care giver worker after one week she ran away after six month i saw her working at a resturant when i confrented her she said well i dont want to work in a house a i want to work outside and thats the only way i can have visa... well u b!!!tch why the hell im paying 10,000 us dollar to ur f***ing goverment... this kind of shit happends alot thats why now most off employers take thier employees passport they lost faith in finding a decent one...
Notice all the people in court are foreigners.
Nobody will go to Qatar after the cup.. because why would you lol what a waste of life and money.
But what do they expect? A 5 bedroon villa with swimming pool and sauna? <br><br>Man, we are born and bought up in countries where we live in the worst conditions imaginable. This is our choice to earn more while working less. <br><br>Why all this drama, while we actually paid huge sum to go to that so called hell. If you are so fed up go to your places
show us plight of palastine people ,afgan ,iran .. the only reason  to show of that smallest country is that they are hosting worls cup . you need to make bad image over them . the plight of blue collar workers are same in almost every under devoloped country. your intention is to make a bad image of them that&#39;s why you put only qatar even if there is alot other countries including African countries. iam also blue collar worker .iam never blaming them cuz they more opportunities to get a work than yours. your plight is just hypocrisy
It looks better than Kenya üòÜüòÜüòÜ
I&#39;m  a Ugandan but I&#39;ve never dreamt of going to work in Arab countries regardless of of what they pay.Most of these Arabs states have no respect for human rights.If I ever decide to go &amp; work abroad, it would be probably be the US or Canada.Less of that , I will always make ends meet in my country.
What about thousands homeless on Paris sleeping in streets during harsh winter
What about those millions suffered in Africa due to France colonise?
What about black market jobs I France who work without full pension rights and medical facilities
What about migrants rights in france
You are the TRUE voice of a humanity and I commend you for that ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§love and place
That‚Äôs what they do specially in Middle East countries
How about poor people in western world. Talk about your people first.
Same things happen to all labourers around the world....
While some things reported in this video show that Qatar is indeed attempting to change the plight of the foreign workers, it is up to the state to enforce its own laws. Unless it does, everything is just White Washing.
I think that keynan worker has been used by media houses! Now it&#39;s hard for him to find job!
Qatar promisses but never delivers. The laws are just made to hoodwink the West, but are never enforced. The whole set up is one big sham. Boycotting the World Cup is the only answer.
Migrant workers were deceived and died for Qatar&#39;s World Cup. <br><br>Thousands want compensation!
Can France and their journalist seated and hosting debates,take us through how France is treating It&#39;s own citizens who are Muslims? <br><br>Can the same journalist take us through how Refugees are treated in France? <br><br>Can the same journalist take us through the  atrocities committed by French government in Different countries they colonised?<br><br>Please Talk about the slavery caused by France and other European countries across the globe even today!<br><br>What I Can seee is only Envy by some European countries to see Qatar hosting world cup.<br><br>I stand by Qatar.
Qatar please pay the immigrants better!
Very sad and heart breaking facts, also a big shame
I dnt understand why this problem of unequal treatment and bad working living condition of migrants are becoming a discussion only at the time of fifa world cup.  There are many countries who do the same kind of inequalities to migrant workers including many other western countries.  If u really want to expose these type of issues , be genuine and unbiased. Dnt take this opportunity to degrade a particular country because of political or religious reasons.
Fake ...all
This infringement of worker rights. Should be stopped.
If the Indian sub continent workers stay in their home without going to work in Gulf, they will die of hunger and unemployment, construction accidents are common, it&#39;s better to work in gulf instead staying in home country and dying of hunger along with family.
Not only Qatar, but all the gulf countries are the same.
Why show it now? The work is done. World cup is about to be completed
Western propaganda
‚§¥Ô∏è Add to get a free ticket to watch the remaining world cup matches live or you&#39;re having a problem getting to Qatar üá∂üá¶  to experience the only sport that unites us with love ‚§¥Ô∏è. Thank me later
In spite of all these obown adversities, Indians, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Philipino people would pay thousands of euros to get work in a Gulf nation. Do you wonder why?  <br>The situation at their home country is far worse.
Britain is still abusing workers here in South Africa.... come see what happens in the mines that is owned by the British and American companies
These countries that are fighting for the human right of Migrant Workers are just as guilty and built their wealth on colonizing other and made lots of money in the slave trade..... <br>Why did they send their soccer teams to Qatar
This situation is very good than other nations citizens
Xenophobic propaganda.
Who is to blame? The countries where these migrant workers belong. They are sending their people to be enslaved legally. No supply. No demand.
Nobody is asking the hard question! Why do you have kids when you cannot provide them with good education, upbringing, and healthcare which will prepare them for a good future! I‚Äôm 37 and do not yet have kids because I wanna make sure I set them up for success in their future! So when you just reproduce without any planning you‚Äôll get impoverished populations that accept any work conditions ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That security company there, life remains the same they never change their attitudes
The building is nice. The rooms are nice. But it&#39;s the people who lives that do not know how to clean their place. Before that was accomodated the place is clean. Even in the flats it&#39;s the people that do not have self discipline in cleaning makes the place dirty. It depends on them how to make their place clean.
So cruel!
Slave labour not just in Qatar it&#39;s 8n Dubai even every Arab country
Free Palestine
Skyscrapers are very nice to see from far away but the people who built are really suffering‚Ä¶and that is the moral of the story in Qatar
Qatar is a rich country but not a civilized one so don‚Äôt expect them to provide human rights to foreigners the way all the EU countries provide. Forget freedom of speech üé§ .
Every country in the whole world has two faces ones the good and the 2nd bad it&#39;s no new for all of us
Shame on the western media on the Hippocratic attitude towards the east, specially middle eastern countries. They don&#39;t see what&#39;s happening with migrant workers in Europe. There are so many untold horrific stories about the migrant workers live in European countries. Instead of criticizing the countries where these migrant worker are coming from and world approved human trafficking&#39;s network which these European countries are keeping a blind eyes on. When comes to anything exciting events happening in middle eastern countries West is quick to find faults and starts negative campaign against it. We are now SICK and TIRED of seeing constant double standards of the West.
Go back home tthen
If not for migrant workers will your father work towards building the stadiums
I‚Äôve used UAE as a flight hub for 30 yrs, even when Dubai‚Äôs airport was like a cheap empty supermarket. I Never once left any airport to visit
There is a misinformation provided here, not everyone is dying to go abroad from India, mostly people who want to go to the middle east are the ones doing a blue collar job in India. The educated prefer the US and Europe and for the vast majority we stay back as you can earn enough if you are qualified and most Indians are highly qualified in India these days and live happily.
Slavery in the modern world

All for the beautiful game  each goal is a hundred lives
The same people that built France were treated like Qatar
With Qatar money so many Muslim people in poverty life can be improved. Similarly those people suffering from war in Muslim countries can be saved and compensated. Air Conditioning for all workers accommodation. Passport to be given back to labourers and freedom to change jobs. Modern Human slavery at its best in Gulf region. üôè
Really inhumane.
Very sad! Heart breaking!
when it about migrant workers in western no one care or they told them to go back home, it is not we come to you it was you come to us
Isreal and US should invade the whole gulf countries. The only language these Arab towel heads understand is the language of conquest.
Look how we are treated in the U.K. by our own giver. We are made to work until we are 65. We are taxed to death causing so much hardship and people having to work long hours and take more then one job to keep afloat . Ordinary people struggling to pay for basic things like food and energy . It‚Äôs terrible how migrant workers are treated highlighted in this video but we need to get our own house in order first before lecturing other countries
Do the countries sending pple to Qatar have embassies there..go to ur country embassy n report
It&#39;s funny how nobody was talking about all this before the world cup.<br>Now, everybody points fingers at Qatar and its violation of human right !! This has been going on forever but somehow it&#39;s time to dramatize this !!! üôÑ<br>By the way, the US and European countries did worse especially during colonization !!!<br>P.S This doesn&#39;t mean at all that I&#39;m supporting what they&#39;re doing ! I condemn all these acts wherever they come from and it&#39;s not only in Qatar by the way.
Cant the news crew help Ibrahim? Get him out of there.
How about expose the troubles of migrants in France
Qatar soon be come like Libya
This sad they use these people as slaves to build they country and they enjoy the rich life wow. God aint sleep.
very peaceful religion indeed
Working in the Middle East is no joke! Period!!!
This is propaganda, worse happens in France
Every country was built on slavery. It was a thing way back in the days. Arab countries was just late to the train.
Why can they clean their own place?
Trust me. If i pick and chose 15 people in US.<br>11 WOULD TALK BAD ABOUT THE NATION
All people like money üí∞ not free working
Good job qutar all world fifa ‚öΩÔ∏è world cup enjoy. Ruissa  china Good
Well,wish all Kenya worker in Qatar can live and work in France with big salary and have house in France..
Very sad in 2022 slave still happened. We must fight for our Human Right.
8yƒ∫ p ‚Åø
I just want Qatari govt &amp; elites to realize the pain n misery they cause to immigrants to fulfill their selfish agenda! And I&#39;m glad that Qatar is losing all its matches in fwc
Those who commited the worst genocides in history against the Syrian, the Iraqi and the Libyan people, exterminated millions and expelled the rest from their homes and lands after occupying them to drown in the Mediteranean and Aegean Sea or to die under the snow in European forests have no.moral authority to defend the rights of Indian workers or any worker in the world. Those who robbed all the gold, diamonds and strategic minerals from Africa and left behind only starvation, civil wars and nightmares  for Africans have no moral authority to defend human rights in Qadar or anywhere else in the world. The Indians in Qadar and the Gulf countries are very thankful to the Emirates and Qadar, even if they receive $200 a month, because they earned not even 1 dolar in India. They were sleeping on the roads of India and dying of cold and hunger at night. They&#39;re not slaves in shackles in Qadar or the Emirates. They come to the Gulf with free will and can leave with free will when they decide.
This is not more than false accusation who is trying to tarnish the image of Qatar. You can see the worker dorm is not clean, this is their own attitude. Why dont they do the cleaning? Why leaving the place dirty? So asked yourself.
Hey
True story of all about human  or migrant labour abuse in Qatar I beleive its.
Amnesty International where are you?
Didn‚Äôt France treat our ppl the same
I don&#39;t want to relate this with race but i have to say that I have seen only white people raised voice against this modern slavery. No other country or race speak against this. <br><br>Thanks<br>From an Indian
When Ibrahim said, <b>&quot;I&#39;m here watching these big buildings... people who built them are really suffering..&quot;</b>  i can feel the hardship he endured through those words. its very heart breaking!
I once had the opportunity to work in Qatar for 5 years. I could say that I was fortunate to have been paid fairly by my employer for my service to her company. I feel sorry for these fellow migrant workers who have been treated badly by their employers. Hopefully, they could find a better job that can compensate them well and have lawful working hours so that they can get proper rest for themselves.
I was there  for almost 4yrs. And all i can say is he is telling the truth
6 1/2 Thousand Lives just to put on a soccer game, how inhumane is that
Culture, real binding with religion, knowledge  from and about the Human Norms and Values are really decisive how people behave, treat  and approach  others.<br><br>!!!!!!
I&#39;m stationed over here under the US Army as are a lot of European and Turkish forces. Most of these workers are very nice and are always smiling. You can see the hurt in their eyes. The hard work on their hands. And the toll it takes on them. This is true around most Gulf States. Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, and others.
I salute European Brothers and Sisters. You people are true voice of humanity over the globe. I admire your efforts to rise the voice of common people
how did a country that doesn&#39;t have basic standards for workers get to host a glossy world cup , as a fa√ßade to show the world how rich and developed they are. I ve heard these migrant workers are currently trapped in an industrial zone in south west Doha , being kept far away from the World Cup so that no media find them and discover the true extent of their suffering
From my personal experience in the labor intense service industry in the GCC, these issues arise from huge gaps in two main bodies, 1. the governments and policy makers with their local multinational consulting firms, 2. the private sector and SMEs mostly run by expats.<br>The exponential growth that these countries have realized due to their large oil profits (which btw was created by developed countries demand) have created these gaps and exploitations due to the failure of bringing the authorities/policy makers up to speed with the fast economic growth and subsequently brought these inhuman and unjust labor rights. Not to mention the shortage in local human resources in most of these countries which are populated by 90% of expats.
as an employee in one of the biggest construction companies there in Qatar, I can testify the struggle of majority of the workers. Even in healthcare sector, they are not prioritized in the Hospitals as they are just 3rd class citizen of this country. I remember one time, we sent 1 worker in the hospital due to ulcer, from 7 am, he spent more than 9 hours waiting for the treatment. Imagine his agony due to severe stomach pain. You forgot to check the most disgusting parts of labor camps such ALATIYA AREA, UM ALAFAI AREA, SHAHANEEYA AREA. these are the worst areas for workers. such a disgrace for Qatari officers to be proud of their achievement where in fact, these abused workers are the HANDS, FEET, BRAINS and the HEART of  every projects completed.
Was working in Qatar for 1.5 yrs and I quit last month due to some of the problems you mentioned<br>Am really happy you did this investigation
Thank you for this video. It&#39;s shocking to learn about these inhumane labor practices happening in a progressive and developed middle eastern country like Qatar. This is like modern slavery wherein millions of foreign migrants--those in construction companies. Their passports being confiscated. If you complain or go on strike, you might be deported. So these migrant workers coming from Africa and Asia were truly exploited and are treated like slaves, working and living in poor conditions. They are not paid well and not even given paid leaves. Imagine, some Filipino women working in beauty or spa salons for 3 years were not given a full day off whereas it was stated in their job contracts that they&#39;re entitled to day-offs monthly. It&#39;s so funny that out of thousand cases filed in the labor courts by ill-treated migrant workers, only 69 cases have been processed. There&#39;s obviously unfair labor practices in Qatar. It&#39;s sad and such a shame that it continues to happen that millions of foreign migrant workers,  behind those facades of the modern infrastructures like the construction of big sports dome/arenas for the 2022 World Cup were built by the modern slaves of the 21st century.
The most shocking thing is the workers not being paid for so long or their pay being held. That is really wrong.
My heart goes out to all these migrant workers including my fellow countrymen who suffered the same experience. May they have a better life ahead of them
Something Al Jaljeera would never cover. Salute to all Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Philippino and African brothers who toiled there in sub human and underpaid conditions.
As an humane Human, I salute all of you for speaking your story here. I personally have heard people tell me how they escaped Qatar. At that point in time, I presumed it to be an individual&#39;s experience, but later as I grew up, read more, and had many more narrate the same story, I knew in that moment, I need to realise that it is a reality. Mentality of this desert cult has never changed, it has transformed into modernity! Same slavery, subjugation of women, atrocities towards LGBT community, and more! They have Sugar coated it to sell their propaganda! Very sad that they are hosting FIFA! I feel, I am going to stay away!
Praying that our Filipino overseas could achieve their dreams for the education of their children. Hope their children should finish schooling.
Big city but an empty kindness. Very sad to look at it.üò¢üò¢üò¢
I was lucky enough when I worked in Qatar that my living condition isn&#39;t as bad as this. Though it&#39;s not an easy life as well. I remember those camps in the middle of the desert which is scary. These companies will never hire professionals in a mass because they can&#39;t afford their rates compared to these poor men who are underpaid and sometimes will not even get paid.
This is unacceptable the living conditions are appalling . All workers need to be compensated for their hard work and inconvenience of living conditions unfit for human living. Exploitation of workers is a human right violation. Thanks to France 24 for covering this painful experience of very hard working people.
That KENYAN worker&#39;s last words almost brought tears into my eyes. I would feel his pain.. The world is indeed a cruel place
This is very heart-breaking!  I can‚Äôt imagine how the workers live that way.  ‚Ä¶ and how qatar rich people do that to those poor people.
Feel really sad for this guy....being slaved yet never lost hope,,,,,God bless him with new opportunities üôèüôè
Yes, there is room for improvement there always is, considering the fact that there are  way more employees than the actual population of Qatar,it  seems to be impossible to give everyone qarari nationality. They need more and more workers as they are an ambitious Nation Europeans and Americans can make it possible because they are large  Nations and they can contribute themselves into the progress of their countries I have soft corner for the employees there including my fellow nationals.hop for the best in coming years.peace...!
As a Canadian-Bangladeshi living in Canada in relative comfort, it breaks my heart to see my people and poor people around the world being treated like this by the gulf countries.
Qatar will eventually be Punished by God for their Ill treatment of Labourers ( Treating them as prisoners of the Country ) and they Will Repent upon their deeds and then they will realise what they had done with them( Labourers) <br><br>God is One .
I feel the pain that Kenyan worker is going through,its all the same in gulf countries i was in UAE &quot;Dubai&quot; for three years as a taxi driver for a government company. You can&#39;t be helped even when u go to labour offices they keep tossing you around. I had to give up and come back to my home country with a life time ban never stepping back to UAE. I have my peace no stress though life is hard back home but i have hope.
I had the same terrible experience when I was in Dubai. Workers in UAE are also facing the same thing like these workers in Qatar. Too bad
I heard a l ot of sad stories from my fellow Filipinos who worked there. Poor living and working conditions, unpaid salaries and low pay were the usual stories for low-level skill workers. In fairness, some Filipino engineers, tech-related professionals, etc do not complain much.
I cancelled our world cup trip to Qatar to pay my tribute to poor workers and their family members who lost their love one&#39;s üôè. God bless them üôè
Pretty much the situation all over the Middle East...<br>I&#39;m Indian; born and bought up in Arabia my whole life....<br>But the hostility and the uncertainty of being unemployed made my parents set plans to return to India....<br>After my parents got a full time permanent job in India last year though for lesser salary; it made the decision more obvious...<br>Cost of living in India is one of the lowest; so if u get a white collar job ( which is a feat by itself ); u r all set to live life....<br>And since Job opportunities have recently been on a rise ( though not all that satisfactory at all and still at a slow pace compared to population size) in India; I expect a lot of them to return like me... And at least I can raise my problems with the court or the police and get done with it because there r laws in place in India which is much much better executed and maintained though we r a poor and developing country...<br> <br>If I thing about my identity, I&#39;m Indian; though I haven&#39;t lived barely a year earlier in India before... U get an identity / a tag line of an &quot;Expat&quot; in the Middle Eastern countries; the term basically means we don&#39;t belong here and we r just here for providing the natives services along with the harassment and lack of rights....U don&#39;t get to own a house, a shop/any type of business can be set only through a native &quot;sponsor&quot; who basically does nothing to contribute to the business but basically gets money and sets their own conditions for having a native support u at least in filing their names in all the formal paperwork to open the business, recently restrictions in holding a driving license, and all sorts of things....<br>But still that Oil money is so addictive, and the strength of currencies in the middle east just makes us forget about &quot;moral values&quot; and stuff; and scrabble to get money through any means whether its red line &quot;slavery&quot; or not because let me be honest; at least I&#39;m properly employed and better off with earning more money...<br><br>U rarely see a church in its full form in the Middle East;  I used to go to  church which was basically a car parking basement converted into a church hall...<br>It was very low key and was under a residential building so that the Police won&#39;t seize the place because its out of sight...
It is very difficult to believe that there are tears behind such affluence- behind such beautiful skyscrapers!
In the Middle east there workers are assigned in tiers based on their nationality and race. Top tier (owner, CEO, president) is for locals, 2nd highest (top managers, consultants, vp, etc) is for Caucasians or the so-called &quot;Western educated&quot; (which just means White), 3rd highest (mid managers) is for arabs from other countries like lebanon, Syria,etc, Then we approach the low tiers. Low level managers and supervisors go to other Arabs, Indians, and sometimes filipinos. The lowest levels are subdivided according to profession and nationality. Hospitality is dominated by Filipinos, sales and commerce by Indians, and the lowest of them all, construction workers and those who clean toilets, etc are Africans, Bangladeshi, etc
Watching this video breaks my heart to see one of the richest country in the World making people suffer like this.<br>Really there is no justice in the World, this world cup should be even cancel.
This situation is not only in Qatar. Every Gulf Nations has same condition.
I am saddened by the harsh realities faced by the migrants. God help their plight.
How can human beings be treated like this?? In the name of sports events?? Shame on them
My husbnd &amp; i once worked in qatar and fortunately our respective employers provided us with descent budget for accomodation.<br><br>It is just unfortunate that some companies does not comply, which the qatar govt should be alarmed already as this reality is coming out in social media and it will be a shame to qatar as a whole
I worked in Qatar&#39;s Ash Shahaniyah for 6 years as a security guard, 12hrs daily without a single off day. We had better living conditions than what am seeing here. Without skills the gulf is very difficult. Don&#39;t go there to do labour instead get some skills. You will be treated better
My heart really bleeds for these migrant workers who have been subjected to modern-day slavery. I plan to come to Qatar to work  but watching this has given me second thoughts about the Middle East as a whole. I wish them success in their pursuit for happiness.
We work outside the country in a very hard condition. The main priority is for our childrens to be educated and to have a degree.
Why they don&#39;t say &quot;thanks to God we let starving thousands of workers?&quot;
Thank you France 24 for this documentary.  My heart goes out for Kenyan works .
This is tragic. The World Cup can be cancelled. The families of the victims should be compensated immediately before the World Cup starts. This is a criminal act.
In a place where there&#39;s greed, there&#39;s exploitation. I&#39;m not sure it will ever end cos that&#39;s human nature. We all want more and more, at the expense of those around us. <br><br>I just hope this doesn&#39;t backfire on those who chose to appear on camera.
√ìtimo programa! Parab√©ns pela reportagem. Espero que o povo do Qatar consiga superar todos esses problemas. Outros paises tamb√©m est√£o na luta contra esse tipo de trabalho escravo, inclusive o meu Brasil. Muitos brasileiros e at√© outros povos sulamericanos passam por esse mesmo tipo de problemas aqui.
Such heart wrenching documentary. Ibrahim&#39;s condition crushed me.
I worked in Qatar 5 yrs and I can relate.
As an African its very sad to seen them like that how they treated them üòî üò¢ üò™
I believe HUMANITY IS THE BEST ACT OF RELIGION. It is unbelievable what people have to go through cos they are less privileged. Salute to all AFRICANS AND ASIANS who endure all this to make their ends meet. May God&#39;s protection, favor and love come your way everyday till you reach your goals.
I pity them üò•<br>  Where is justice to these poor workers? They do not deserve this!
Shocking, heartbreaking üíî
Thank you for exposing the struggles of the workers. It is shocking how these people are exploited.
I wonder how the world community has agreed such a big tournament (the world cup) to be played in an inhuman country. The way Qatar treats these workers was enough to disqualify this country for holding this tournament.
A commendable work I have since then changed my mind to moving there.
As an Indonesian expat in Qatar, I didn&#39;t know about this though. Providing an accommodation like this is already known as unfair but upon hearing that they did not provide any canteens, I&#39;m surprised. I have lived in Qatar for 12 years now.
This is the reality of all Gulf Countries, they make foreigners living conditions horrible, so much so that they can&#39;t even say a word or protest for their own rights.<br>Companies will hold their passports and refuse to give them back even when they say they don&#39;t want to work with the company anymore.I really feel so sorry for those living in these Gulf Countries.
This is very heartbreaking I‚Äôm a former worker in Middle East but I‚Äôm lucky my boss was good but no day off,some of my friends were abuse no salary,that‚Äôs why I left after 2 1/2 years,let the world knows this.
This is truly heartbreaking and cruel stuff.
I&#39;m  a Ugandan but I&#39;ve never dreamt of going to work in Arab countries regardless of of what they pay.Most of these Arabs states have no respect for human rights.If I ever decide to go &amp; work abroad, it would be probably be the US or Canada.Less of that , I will always make ends meet in my country.
This situation is not only in Qatar all the gulf countries <br>#24 thanks for exploring this video
From an unbiased point of view, the companies who contracted these poor fellows are to blame for the miserable situations. In the end Qatar is not heaven for all but law must be refined to maintain poorer rights
Each and every country must take care about their citizens: jobs, access to housing, education and health care. So painful to watch these disperate people.
As a South African my aunt who&#39;s a professional nurse worked in Qatar for more than a decade and they treated her very well, she made a lot of money which she invested and started businesses back home in South Africa. She contracted multiple myeloma whilst there which is a kind of blood cancer and they gave here first class cancer treatment and was given permanent residence and they were ready to grant her citizenship but she was homesick and wanted to return South Africa of which she&#39;s been happily back here for 3 years<br><br>I feel bad for my fellow African people but please refrain from going to where you&#39;re not appreciated. Your dignity and humanity matters more
There is a misinformation provided here, not everyone is dying to go abroad from India, mostly people who want to go to the middle east are the ones doing a blue collar job in India. The educated prefer the US and Europe and for the vast majority we stay back as you can earn enough if you are qualified and most Indians are highly qualified in India these days and live happily.
This Is How Journalism Looks Like.<br>Hats Off To France 24 For Its Reporting And Rising This Serious Issue
As a Indian Muslim, my uncle was worked as system administrator in Qatar, and from there he made too much money and 2 years before he  retired and now he own 4 shop in india,
This is absolutely disgraceful, people should Boycott the World Cup.
Please invite all those workers to watch the matches. By doing so you might reduce some of the damage caused to this poor workers. Please treat them with respect...they are the real heroes , behind the construction of huge stadiums.
Very sad! Heart breaking!
This also happens in EU in most of the countries but kept secret....
Qatar üá∂üá¶ is a wonderful country it‚Äôs a very rich country and there‚Äôs so many opportunities to get good jobs. I don‚Äôt know why all of this envy and hatred towards it. We love Qatar if you don‚Äôt want to work there don‚Äôt go there
It does amaze me how some people can be so numb to the suffering of their fellow man. Just evil beyond words
I worked in Qatar for 7 years as a company nurse working in construction sites. I can confirm this report regarding the poor working condition of workers especially people coming from asian countries like bangladesh, india, philippines, pakistan and nepal. I&#39;ve seen worst things than this as I was also subjected to this treatment even though I am a Nurse by profession. Asian workers are severely discriminated against by Arabs and treated like sub-human. Living condition for workers coming from arab muslim countries like Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Morroco etc. are better compensated with better salary and accomodation. while asian workers live in shanties. Taking photos and videos of the situation and posting it online is prohibited. Protesting or complaining can lead to automatic deportation. It&#39;s hell on earth and I don&#39;t have plans of returning. very bad experience. I can speak now because I&#39;m free from the hellhole that is Qatar.
I think the fact that they keep their passports, is very sad üò¢
Thanks for this video i almost went their as a worker but now I decided not go their üëç
Heartbreaking situation...how can such rich rich country like Qatar can be able to see the suffering and mistreatment of the  workers... you are proud to show the world what you have done at the expensese of thi migrant workers.. praying that they will have justice on this workers ...who work very hard and the due should be given to them....
I am a Kenyan who works in Qatar but as a professional driver. I have stayed in Qatar for 3 years now. There is so much untold truth that the world doesn&#39;t know about labourers who work here. Many of them face harsh treatment from their sponsors and they are left to cry for themselves. I personally know a few friends who work illegally because their sponsors threatened to put them behind bars if they dare speak up, no help whatsoever has been given and some had to escape and live out as fugitives. They work in any condition either day or night as long as they have something to meet their needs. They need help and their families back at home can&#39;t do anything to help out. It&#39;s so sad we are still in slavery
May God keep you brothers and sisters safe even in the hostilities of that land. But let people know that we shall all be held to account of how we handled God&#39;s creation
I dnt understand why this problem of unequal treatment and bad working living condition of migrants are becoming a discussion only at the time of fifa world cup.  There are many countries who do the same kind of inequalities to migrant workers including many other western countries.  If u really want to expose these type of issues , be genuine and unbiased. Dnt take this opportunity to degrade a particular country because of political or religious reasons.
I can see ‚ÄúCarrefour‚Äô written on Ibrahim‚Äôs uniform who is showing around the accommodation. Carrefour is a French leading grocery chain store with many many many stores in Doha. They are making a lot of money then why its employee is in such a bad condition? What happened to their policies towards their employees? Don&#39;t you think its carrefour‚Äôs direct responsiblity for the well being of its employees???  I hope this comment will not be removed!
The Kenyan guys , are the star of this  documentary....Long Live to you men....as long you standing ,still fight to achieve your dreams ...so sad to this Nation there abusing migrant workers.....I also migrant worker Filipino in Arab üåé
I hope that Rachel the Filipino workers children realize just how much their mother is sacrificing for them; and that they appreciate her.  She is a HERO!
You are the TRUE voice of a humanity and I commend you for that ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§love and place
U‚Äôll never see Al-Jazeera Covering this! ü§£
I worked in Middle east-( during the hot season about 43 degrees celcius about just 5 minutes I stayed Outside - I felt like dying-( how about them? I feel so bad for them
Sometimes when I see this kind of evil i begin to wonder how i was born into this evil world without my permission üò¢
It just breaks my heart to see how the vulnerable among us are being subjected to conditions that pass for slavery.
The message to Qatar should be clear: If it cannot sort out the migrant workers crisis before the world cup; they can forget about even thinking about hosting any other international event; let alone the Olympics. I hope the migrant workers get paid for all the toils they endured.  As  former Fifa president Sepp Blatter recently admitted &quot;Awarding Qatar the tournament was a mistake&quot; . Although Qatar will not address every cry of the migrant workers, it should be pushed to the limit. I hope the same journalist will contact the same sources during the world cup where the focus will be on that country.
Africa needs to reinvent itself and see how to make meaning out of their abundant resources. <br>Otherwise our children will keep suffering anywhere they will go.
Certainly abuse will occur as long as the kafala system permits it. Still, one cannot but notice that one of the main worries of migrant workers is deportation without backpay. Added to the permanent threat of an uncertain future, it all amounts to enormous stress. Hopefully the situation will change for the better, as surely Qatari employers can afford to do the right thing and live up to their commitments in accordance with the generous nature traditionally attributed to Arabs.
I do hope they&#39;re heard! Bring this evil companies down and compensate those affected.
After viewing this video I can&#39;t help but wonder how lucky we are to live in are great country,  and I feel so much more appreciative for being born in this great place we call home, sometimes we forget how good we have it here, and I feel sorry for the people they are showing.
I remember the time during my first month I went here. It was so hot and I saw those labourers keep on working even in the middle of the day. Hayst... some if them is sleeping just in the road
So heart breaking for exploiting these poor people.
Thank you for highlighting this.. i can feel the stench of the skyscrapers after this expose.. very sad indeed..
Migrant workers were deceived and died for Qatar&#39;s World Cup. <br><br>Thousands want compensation!
I would love to see the world sue all these employers for breach of contract and human rights violations
the thanks should be to the hard working labourers n skilled workers without them it wouldn&#39;t have been possible. ...appreciate them now b thankful to them
Give quatar a sunction if they don&#39;t comply despite of international criticism
