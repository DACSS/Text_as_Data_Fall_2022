I’ll try to get the next video essay out in less than a month lol
Maqwell is just basically a god tier channel and a god tier person, i love these essay videos, 100% better than most of your fifa videos, keep it up
I feel like a Qatar World Cup had potential to be good for the world. A deconstructable stadium, new infrastructure etc. But the use of slave labor, violations of human rights, and Interruption of the season for the World Cup with breaks of only a week makes this World Cup the scummiest World Cup. Not to mention that instead of addressing these, the Qataris are often crying racism and using whataboutism. The negatives outweigh the positives. FIFA should have auditing groups who visit the host countries right after they are awarded the rights to host something to check how the workers are being treated and whether they have enough funding, with help from Human Rights and Financial Organizations. But we know FIFA, they prefer money over Human Rights sadly. As an Indian, seeing my countrymen die because they have been fed lies about their wages hurts me.
Great video, as an Arab i feel guilty because i want an Arabic country to represent us and be the first at it and i felt like qatar was great for that but when i later discovered the horrible things they did i only felt guilty and ashamed.<br>It is to note however that not only Qatar does this but most countries in Asia and the middle east do everything you&#39;ve mentioned including the sponsors, such countries like S.Korea, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Japan, China, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and others I can&#39;t name from the top of my head.<br>Edit: this obviously doesn&#39;t excuse their actions i thought it was too obvious that i didn&#39;t say this I&#39;m sorry and I just liked to mention that because it&#39;s a global problem that needs to be fixed not only in Qatar but the whole world
A very fantastic video and sorry for the incoherent rambling below<br>As an Indian living in Qatar for practically my whole life (and ironically likely to miss the World Cup next year), I was hyped when it was announced in 2010 that the hosts were gonna be Qatar especially because it always seemed to me that only Europe, the Americas, Australia, Japan and China usually host these kinds of things. Many celebrated out in the streets because that&#39;s what usually happens when your tiny country hosts the world cup. But then I grew up and got exposed to the horrible conditions that were happening behind the scenes through the internet. However, it was always kinda uncomfortable when Twitter accounts or Youtube channels kinda feel like they would happily just keep the world cup always within the limits of the Europe, and always feel like it&#39;s guilt-tripping when, to be honest, I didn&#39;t exactly contribute to the human rights abuses. So it&#39;s kind of a relief when at the end you said at the end to not feel guilty about watching the World Cup. Football is out of the control of fans structurally for a long time when the Oil industry was almost omnipresent throughout with Gazprom, the Middle Eastern takeovers etc and hosting has been for a long time been corrupt with 1998,2006,2010(maybe),2018 and 2022. It&#39;s gonna take complete destruction of the current institutions to take it back. I&#39;m kinda glad that the main arguments didn&#39;t revolve around football pedigree or the winter slot (which I feel was dumb since the Melbourne Olympics took place in December) and has mainly stayed with genuine issues like human rights violations and social issues.<br><br>Overall, Great video, As someone who has gone to one of these stadiums and have friends who&#39;ve visited as well, I don&#39;t doubt for spectators it&#39;s gonna be a good or great world cup but it has to always be in our minds the many problems plaguing it.
I want to put in a controversial point of view. Had it not been for the World Cup, the issues of slave labour in Qatar would not have come to light. It is a country with a plethora of other major projects and the human rights violations that happen there would not have garnered much if any international attention. Only because the World Cup is such a big event that Qatar went under the microscope for their labour system. Its horrible that more people had to die, but as I am writing this I believe new labour reforms have been passed by Qatar thanks to the added international attention that the World Cup brought. Of course it remains to be seen whether the changes will stay after the games
As a person who has lived in Qatar basically my whole life and left a few months ago, I did not want to believe this, it was something so exciting and rare a country literally the size of a fricking mouse, was going to host the tournament of the world, I was overwhelmed with excitement and just slapped all the negative news, but now since i actually have a open mind now, Qatar definitely did not deserve to get responsibility of getting the world cup, its sad a country so close to my heart did something against human rights, Im just praying that its all improved and even that can’t take away the sadness i feel, we just have to accept the bribery
I&#39;ve worked as a road side automotive electrician in Muscat,Oman. My schedule was like , <br>6.30 AM - wake up,cook food,breakfast<br>8.00 AM - start duty<br>2.30 PM- lunch(cook food), small nap<br>4.00 PM- again start duty<br>1.00 AM-3.0 AM- duty ends, Dinner(cook food),sleep<br>6.30 AM- repeat<br><br>The duty was 6 days in a week, and salary less than 400$ per month.<br> Now I work in Europe, but I still think about the poor souls working in that hell.
Great video man, very interesting and well researched. I hope your channel keeps on growing. Keep grinding and take your time on making the video essays because they are worth the wait. Take care.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_m7_rrTSxI&amp;t=8m56s">8:56</a><br>Small correction! Not all of those 6500 workers are not related to the world cup. They are the number of workers that died on every construction site in Qatar since the announcement about the cup in 2010, this includes new airports, a public transportation system and more. However the number isn’t categorized by where they died so there is no correct estimation about the actual number.<br><br>I can’t post the link to the article but its the same article that the headline is from. <br><br>Ps: Im not defending Qatar i just want to inform about a small misunderstanding :)
As someone of Bengali descent, I feel really sorry for my brothers back home. It seems that no matter where they go, their work lives are horrific. Same goes for all the other migrant workers.
Well done on covering the human rights in Qatar, I&#39;ve seen it first hand when I went to Dubai. It seems strange to me that such a rich country chooses not to pay its staff correctly. They could/should be setting a high standard. Gary Neville&#39;s coverage in Qatar is also a strange one considering his own political views
I have a lot of personal thoughts from this video &amp; I really enjoyed your coverage!<br><br>Such an important video, and you’re right, we as fans don’t have the influence to be able to force pressure onto Qatar, but what can be done in terms of this video is to be mindful on how the process to the 2022 World Cup happened, and that ugliness must really be ensured that it shouldn’t happen again in future World Cup competitions.<br><br>It’s not just Qatar that has the kafala system but all the Gulf states do as well (Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, etc.). <br><br>Also, the Gulf states have a TON of immigrants, or as they would like to call the East Asians/S.E. Asians: migrants, as opposed to the people coming from more privileged backgrounds (aka whites): expats. The very least these Gulf states can do to the people that legit built the whole country is to recognize their importance &amp; their significance at the very least. They are just left under the mud, some treated like actual below shit at times. I remember seeing in Dubai, in 2021, god awful living conditions of workers in the middle of the desert, right beside a place called Global Village, a place full of entertainment, shopping, seeing cultures from all around the world. That stark contrast was honestly appalling from me, yet I’m just not surprised sadly. <br><br>In terms of LGBTQ rights in Arab states, imo I’m somehow even less optimistic about that than workers rights unfortunately.
This video essay is exactly what the world needs. Super informative, clear and well structured. I especially like the afterword — which opens up the idea that being mindful of the federations/corporations/institutions we support and oppose, can prevent future corrupt operations and save future migrant worker lives.<br><br>That being said, as video essay, your points would be even stronger if you left your sources as an appendix either in the description or throughout the video ;)
I know this is just a YouTube video but I think that is good to clarify some points:<br><br>- The kafala system does not make you pay to get the job. That was a horrible practice by a lot of scammy recreuitmen companies in their home countries. <br>For example, in Nepal they may promise a foreman job for those that qualify and can pay 3.000 USD. If you don&#39;t have the money don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll discount it from your salary later.<br><br>At that time the companies in Qatar were hiring people with little control, and since they needed workers fast they wouldn&#39;t bother if they were qualified. They needed the numbers.<br><br>So the HR guys in Qatar would get money from the recruitment companies outside, choose them and hit their targets with people that in many many cases has never been in a construction.<br><br>So you would see them coming down from the plane all confused, out of their village for the first time, and put to work even with flip flops.<br><br>And yes, you could see how they loaded the cofins of one or two people back einthe plane that just brought the next load of workers.<br><br>Taking the passport was also a common practice in many construction companies, and fortunately that is now outlawed. And Qatar started to take the enforcement of the law more seriously, thanks to the international backlash.<br><br>So now they took action against the companies doing recruitment abuses, for example opening official visa offices in the countries so people have to go through the government channels and not those shady companies.<br><br><br>Another improvement is in safety conditions. You don&#39;t see workers on flip-flops anymore. All are wearing safety equipment and the rate of accidents and deaths has definitely gone down.<br><br>So that&#39;s good, and wouldn&#39;t have happened without the international outcry. So they deserve some credit for that.<br><br>Also they were the first country to announce the end of the kafala system, although the reality is that it is still in place (you still need a sponsor and a no objection letter to transfer sponsohip), so workers cannot change jobs freely. And that is a shame.<br><br>Also the compounds for the workers that you showed in the video are real an are being used, especially by companies related to the world Cup. But yeah, living conditions for blue collar workers can be improved across the board outside of those.<br><br>The points about the LGTB are easy prey, but misunderstanding the reality. There is no prosecution of gay people. In fact it is easier for a guy to book a room with 5 others than with a girl that is not his wife. Nobody will bat an eye. And if you ask people in the LGTB community you will hear how they love it in the GCC countries.<br><br>The law that punishes gay sex is the same that affects straight sex: Any sex outside of marriage is illegal, hence all gay sex is too.<br><br>And that opens a topic that is widely ignored by the media. If an unmarried woman gets pregnant, she better leave the country before the authorities are informed (mandatory by law). Or in the case of rape, the victim (male or female) can be prosecuted for sex out of wedlock.<br><br>It is easy to criticise Qatar, and there is a lot of room for improvement, but it is important to praise their progress and demand that they continue and fulfill their promises (like truly ending the kafala).<br><br>That was the case in other GCC countries too.
Just found your channel and it&#39;s absolutely fantastic! Your editing and writing is a gift to the footballing community &lt;3
This was a very good video maqwell, enjoying these essays videos a lot and I cant wait for the next one to come out! Much love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ❤️
Yeah I agree and to be honest, I feel the 2022 Wolrd Cup would be a bad world cup due to the scandals and other horror atrasosy. I will still watch it and boi, let see how the 2022 Wolrd Cup plays out
It’s rare finding channels that make good content like yours bro
Excellent video. I strongly believe that one very small but impactful thing that could be done would be to refer to the tournament only as the 2022 World Cup and exclude all mention of Qatar. <br><br>The only time the country should be mentioned should be to highlight the corruption during the bidding process, the human rights abuses, and their intolerant attitudes. <br><br>This was a vanity project for the Qatar rulers and they should not get the praise that they&#39;re looking for.
Coming from Kenya, this is horrifying to me, and after watching @Adam Something&#39;s video on Dubai, and having been to Qatar two weeks ago for Formula 1, having seen all pretty much all of the stadiums it left a sour taste in my mouth the entire vacation
As an arab, I was really glad that Qatar got the world cup, Perhaps this will help breach barriers between the east and the west I thought. Little did I know this was a World cup built upon the blood and suffering of innocent workers
I think it comes down to one question: Would I go to or watch a party, for which, thousands of people had to die in an avoidable manner that is only being hosted there because of corruption? I understand not watching it won`t change anything, but I choose not to.
A proper research and dedication can seen on this video👍🏻 Thanks for covering this topic as this has to be viral all over the world. I am from Nepal and i saw more than 3/4 coffins are arriving Nepalese Airport from Middle east countries and out of four, 3 bodies are come from Qatar
The production quality of this is really good, especially for how under appreciated your channel is. I feel like I&#39;m finding someone early who is gonna blow up in the next couple years
What an informative video. Thank you so much for your time and effort that you have put in to it
I know it probably won&#39;t happen, but I&#39;d like to see you talk about other leagues from other continents.<br>One interesting case is that of Fortaleza; after a near decade in Brazil&#39;s third division, they have recently earned themselves a spot in the first ever Copa Libertadores.
What’s sad is several people on social media either downplay the slave labor or deny it ever happened and throw the “you just hate muslims” rhetoric.
What you did not mention and while not proven but very likely true - Of those stadiums a good number of them have dead workers in the concrete. There are a number of reports of accidents where people fell, died in the heat and in one way or another ended up in the concrete.
The reaction of the attendees after announcing Qatar says everything 😂😂😂
this guy is so underrated. so glad i found this guy. big legend<br><br><br>and no im not one of those people who say this just to gain some clout, im being dead serious. this guy is amazing
I feel so sorry for fellow country men from Philippines that they’ve treated so bad just to build this stadiums, the harsh conditions 😔😔
Man, you are so underrated, you talk about things that people really don&#39;t know and you help us understand certain things that we should know, keep the great work
As much as I want it to come home as an English person. I just feel that winning the world cup next year won&#39;t mean as much due to the disgraces around the tournament
Great video , loved every part of it but i disagree with the last one ‘’Hate not Love ‘’ i my self am a Muslim  but that dosent mean that i hate gay people or would treat them any differently but that also dosent mean that i have to support the lgbtq community simply because my religion doesn’t allow it and we talk so much about everyone having the right to opinions so we can’t force a Country into supporting something they simply dont<br> want to  or aren’t allowed to do so .Just so u guys know, im not saying that qatar or any other country should be allowed to execute gay people.
This is horrific. Well made video. Keep up the good work.
So, this is the second video I watch from your channel and I&#39;m subscribing. I really like your opinions and you&#39;re good at talking.<br><br>As you might guess I&#39;m mexican and about the past friday qualifier, all I can say is that USMNT won all my respect. No rage, no h8 at all. It was a clean match where this young generation demonstrated that they have the balls to stand up and make a statement to the whole CONCACAF. Same goes for Canada, a huge surprise this time and this makes me realize that a lot of national teams have gotten better, but sadly that&#39;s not the case of Mexico.<br><br>Saludos, hermano, thank you for these videos.
I&#39;ve seen a lot of ppl on the internet saying they won&#39;t watch the World Cup and that players should not be taking part in it. At one point, i understand why you should turn your head against this kind of corruption, but at the same time I feel like a toddler who just wants to see his country or his favourite player lift the World Cup. (I&#39;m a Ronaldo fan, I hope he wins it)
yes, as a supporter you do have a certain power in your hands because you vote every day with your wallet for the policies you support and those you dont support, and by boycotting the world cup and it&#39;s partners you are kicking money out of hands of these criminal scum.<br>If a significant amount of fans decided to boycott this tournament, FIFA would surely realize the whole thing is not worth it, but it wont happen because people can&#39;t go without watching their precious De Bruyne and Neymar for a month
I’ve watched a lot of your recent videos and thought you were a funny football commentary channel, which is why I subscribed. <br>But coming across this hard hitting journalism from you is a very pleasant surprise, props man great vid.
I do kinda disagree with you adding the bit about watching the world cup, I don&#39;t think it was necessary. Plus if people do not watch, it will teach FIFA not to award questionable countries as hosts, but again whether you watch or don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t diminish the atrocities committed.
The nonchalance the foremen and managers show toward the workers&#39; deaths and mistreatment is genuinely chilling.
I have a cousin who worked in Saudi Arabia as an engineer for 3 years. Believe me when i say that compared to Saudi Arabia Qatar is a heaven for human and worker&#39;s rights.
Hey Maqwel, Ahmad from Qatar here.<br><br>Fair video very informative. However, one major error when talking about the kafala system. The worker does not pay the sponsor any money for a job opportunity. They pay so called &quot;job agencies&quot; in their home country that made a business out of selling job opportunities. The sponsor in fact has to pay the country 1000-1500 dollars to open a visa for a migrant worker. Most of these opportunities are great for the countries that usually apply for said opportunities to the point where they go into debt to pay the job agency to to land a Qatari opportunity. The reason why the opportunity is lucrative for the migrant worker is that the min wage in Qatar is about 500 USD monthly. While, in countries where these migrant workers come from, the min wage is can be as low as 50 USD monthly. So to circumvent the cost of landing a job in Qatar for migrant workers. Qatar opened the Qatar Visa Center, where migrants who look for jobs can directly communicate with the Qatari embassies who will give out job opportunities for free. Saving already poor migrant workers thousands of dollars. <br><br>That is not to say there are no issues with the Qatari labor market. There are cases where migrant working for large mostly international corporations did not get paid for months. And that is very true and extremely heartbreaking. But where it stings is that videos like yours make it seem that Qatari ethics should be on the stage for questioning and not the western conglomerates with their crony capitalistic ideals trying to milk a small nation through exploiting all their legal loopholes, work visas and their wage protection systems.
Love the content, now that I know you have an account where you’re covering the off season, I’ll definitely be tuning in.
I can see this channel grow with high quality editing and great research of this topic. Imma start watching the podcast that you recommend to us. Also take your time with your video. Thier a reason why your views are starting to increase.
Awesome vid, really informative not to mention eye opening. Quite shocking how mainstream media is not talking about this
Honestly man you make some of the most interesting videos I&#39;ve ever seen, keep up the good work!
FIFA is really stepping up their spitting-on-human-rights game after hosting the cup in Russia
Thanks bro for this documentary. Really, noone ever mentioned something, yea just out of a desert an stadium comes out with noone dead on 50C degrees. I feel sad that poor workers needed to die, so the Ritch Arabs can make the poor Arabs proud in the eyes of their western colonialists. Sad
Brilliantly researched piece. If I may respectfully disagree with the conclusion however. Yeah, it’s not the fault of individual football fans but that’s exactly why the World Cup should be boycotted. If billions once againtune in to watch it just legitimises slavery and rampant corruption. <br><br>Fans should boycott this abominable tournament and federations should too. Wouldn’t it have been admirable of, say, the English FA, upon qualifying, to then withdraw their national side from the tournament in protest at the human rights violations that have gone on in building the infrastructure and the naked corruption in awarding it to Qatar in the first place?<br><br>Federations boycotted apartheid South Africa and Chile a few decades ago, there is no honour or backbone in our institutions anymore and a hideous apathy towards horror, injustice and ever-widening gap between fans, clubs and the wider football apparatus that will just go on and on.
I was Rewatching this again and it reminded that humanity is scary like shivering scary but I also recommended this to people who watch football and ask me “why is the World Cup in the Fall/Winter” and just like me , they were all in awe. Man the BGM you chose made the video eerie but it was perfect for what you were conveying.
You had me until you started saying we shouldn’t feel guilty. Clearly trying to justify yourself watching the tournament. Who are these dying workers building these stadiums for? Who is fifa trying to entertain? Who is paying for this to happen via jerseys, viewership, sponsor purchases, stadium tickets, etc? The fans. We are part of this as well. And we are not innocent.
The saddest Thing (except for the slaves of course) is that its completly obvious that Qatar bought that WC and FIFA was ok with that.
Keep up the great work!!
Very mature &amp; educated breakdown of the subject topic 😍🥰👏👏👏👍👌<br>I&#39;m really impressed by how thurough your video is. <br>You have no bias, &amp; provide a complete bird&#39;s eye view of the truth regarding the subject.
Rip to the people who died making this beautiful stadiums 🏟 💔
This is a good video to anyone who asks  “Why do we still have workers unions?” <br><br>Cause if you don’t you’ll have working conditions like the migrant workers in Qatar
The USMNT finally got a Good Squad and I&#39;m going to feel guilty watching the World Cup Next November. Also, I see your shirt. See you in 2022! Vamos Atlanta!
Well put together report! Love your channel
Since 2002 every World Cup host (except for Germany, who only built three new stadiums) has spent billions to build brand new stadiums for the tournament. England and the U.S. already have stadiums ready to go, and there are billions to be made in construction contracts to build new stadiums. That is why England and the U.S. lost out to Russia and Qatar for 2018 &amp; 2022. The only reason North America got the 2026 WC is because all the corruption with FIFA was uncovered.
I will also be watching the World Cup like any other football fan, but also with a great distaste. Imagine watching your favorite footballers celebrate the game on the graves of so many labor workers. It&#39;s disgusting.
My new favorite Football channel, love your style of videos bro ! Steady follower 💪☝️
This is one of the best videos you ever made well done😊😊😊😊
great video! <br>there have been so many south asian migrants, Indians especially who are stuck in Qatar even during COVID <br>Fifa is a very corrupted organisation
I lived 16 years in that country. It is so corrupted that it does not even have a proper justice system. Extremely poor legal environment; i advise everyone to not even think about investing there
Honestly, this video is well made. So I applaud you
What a beautiful conclusion to this video man, we will come together to play the beautiful game in purity, regardless of the atrocities, the heart is contagious, and that is the only power we have
All this is happening and fifa is getting mad at mexicos crowd for saying puto 🤣🤣
Are the countries of the migrant workers doing anything on the diplomatic and international level to protect the rights and lives of their citizens? I guess they could at least try to sue Qatar at the International Human Rights Court for damages for families of people that died due to poor working conditions.
I&#39;m an Australian, so this is obviously a biased opinion, but I really think Australia would be a good host for a WC. Kids in Australia love football/soccer and there are many stadiums here too. The only problem I could see with Australia hosting the WC is the heat, as it would be in our summer as we are in the southern hemisphere, but we could also possibly cohost will New Zealand too.
<b>Makes video about sufferings and injustices of Qatar 2022 and proceeds to say he will watch it as he didn&#39;t directly contribute to the hardships whilst completely failing to mention the monetary gains Qatar will make despite frequently mentioning financial objectives throughout the video. Classless</b>
I know this video is close to a year old, but it still relevent for all Football fans around the world to know of all that was sacrificed for this world cup to even take place.  So sad.
It improved alot in last 5 years  but after so many deaths.   Companies are fined or ban if salaries not paid with in certain time.
Good job doing research. Same-sex rules are dependent on the country laws. This is not considered illegal or corrupt. We can&#39;t ask any country to change their laws just because they believe otherwise.
Goodness me, this video was outstanding. Keep up the great work.
your channel is so good, i don&#39;t understand how you&#39;re not bigger! this video was also great, really informative and entertaining.
Thanks for the summary. I won&#39;t be watching the tournament this year. At some point we have to say, &#39;enough&#39;, right?
Another issue I’ve thought of: alcohol. As we all know, the target demographic of football is fat bald men who drink beer everyday, and as alcohol is haram, there won’t be any to supply the fans. And because of the heat, I can’t see many fans travelling to Qatar
Qatar 2022: The cup of the shame
Man I wish so much that the US would have won the bid for hosting the 2022 World Cup. Would’ve been incredible to attend matches of both Messi’s and Ronaldo’s last world cup
This (and similar content) should really have more views!
Great video bro keep it up!
While I am disgusted by Qatar’s human rights record, I would still support my country at the World Cup because we haven’t been since 1958
Same thing happened in Brazil no one cared except the locals. Except the people dying part
Awesome video, i guess i would have liked the ending to be less pessimistic though.
I love the videos bro!!! Keep it up!!!!
I just want to say that the creator, it is your job to create the videos but I would like to pray for your success and your family may god bless you. Thank you soo much for making time to do research and making this video. My people from nepal and the people of my neighbouring countries INDIA, BANGLADESH, PAKISTAN AND SRILANKA they died for Qatar&#39;s fantasies.
Whenever I see those reports about FIFA, UEFA, and, to a lesser degree, IOC, I wonder why the countries&#39; football/athletics federations don&#39;t simply tell those corrupt agencies to go to hell, and form new ones. Corruption, doping, and shady deals wherever you look, it&#39;s crazy.
if theres something that could bring me hope for humanity is that, one of the finalist of the world cup just leave the match in protests
One reason I could see why usa media isn&#39;t touching it is because its related to football (soccer for them) which majority of people there don&#39;t really care much for it although this is probably just simple minor reason
I think what is happening is a Qatari company is doing all of this madness but people are blaming the economy and government
This WC is such a dilemma. An Arabic country finally becomes a WC host but all the deaths and forces labour had been atrocious
my dad and mom still get delayed salaries working in high paying jobs and they dont even get payed as much as people born in the country even if they worked the same jobs
Great video man. I couldn’t help noticing the impressive kit collection behind you. do you know any good websites/ stores for jerseys?
Great video..and nice research maqwell!!
Can&#39;t believe how you only have 68k subs. You deserve way more bro
I feel like 2022 World Cup is gonna be the worst we’ll ever see
Great work, Maqwell
Extra Fact: The Average League In Qatar For Fans Is Less Than 700
