My uncle fell into this trap but in Dubai decades ago, I got to see his families&#39; living conditions once and it was haunting, a full apartment the size of an American parking space, I felt so sorry for them but there was nothing we could do as they were trapped, I was moreso angry with myself for being so ignorant, thankfully they were able to move into a better space recently
Hey Johnny, thank you for the coverage. It&#39;s really eye-opening how massive the exploitation is. It baffled me the extent humans will go to exploit others. It&#39;s got nothing to do with religion, race, skin color, etc. I mean they obviously have the means to provide a better working condition, wage system, and recruitment system, but they refused to do so just because they can. JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN. They consciously make profit out of people&#39;s suffering just because they can.
The world Cup authorities were warned about inhumane human conditions....but ofcourse money hides brutally and corruption....by the way the gulf region is exactly the same....I used to visit the UAE often, but never will I consider seeing that entire part of the world ever again...Thank you for this program. .it hurtsüò•
You are an absolute legend Johnny. Keeping the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù population informed about corruption and not talked about news around the world. Great mini doc as always.
Please do a follow up video this time next year - what has changed, what has become of the &#39;industrial area&#39;, are workers still &#39;trapped&#39; and forced to work in unethical labour camps for zero compensation? Or did Qatar make amends and fix their humanitarian wrongdoings? It&#39;s clear that Qatar&#39;s questionable World Cup is in the limelight now, on this channel and others, but like you said, this will mostly be forgotten in a few months, such is human nature. It would therefore be interesting to review the long term effects of this unfortunate social/economic &#39;experiment&#39; once footballing eyeballs have left, hopefully hold everyone accountable. Maybe it will also be easier to film and document in more detail next year when Qatar is no longer in the spotlight. 
The thing is even extremely strong countries like India face this then smaller ones like Nepal bang pak would obviously do <br>In india I read there&#39;s the population boom and that&#39;s why these people get trapped now indians in Qatar can do nothing nor the government of india cuz it was their choice I have read more about india so there the govt has great rel with Qatar moreover they can act but don&#39;t have the ground to do so<br>That&#39;s a trap that their native countries can&#39;t defend them from yiu are a lone wolf in Qatar <br>Well maybe if we put pressure in the indian govt (whose citizens are directly involves and  the only country which is strong enough to make Qatar pay maybe a boycott from india usa Germany together could do so)
<br>I really like how you&#39;ve covered this topic, it&#39;s quite well done and I appreciate the effort to try and a hands on view of the whole situation. This is one of the more objective stories I&#39;ve seen on this issue. Much thanks.ted quite harshly with abysmal working conditions. The footage you&#39;ve collected is quite accurate and it&#39;s impossible not to notice living there. Every where you go, you could see them working on the side of the road and on buildings wearing the uniforms even in the heat. There are a lot of parts of the city, especially industrial area where you have huge labour camps. But the thing is, it&#39;s so normalisied that it doesn&#39;t really stand out or seen as that big of a problem. It&#39;s sort of just accepted. This is the case for most gulf countries, where you have a huge portion of the labour class essentially just segregated, and the kafala system is a rapant problem and a huge human rights issue across the region. Qatar has a huge immigrant population, mainly to reach it&#39;s 2030 goal and vision for the future. Seeing as most of the infrastructure for those projects have already been completed, it&#39;s a bit too late. The damage has been done. The fact that Qatar is an incredibly rich country and could&#39;ve easily paid these workers fair wages yet they chose to actively exploit them for as cheap as possible baffles me. 
I&#39;ve heard about this issue in Dubai as well many years ago in the early 2000s. Glad that more people are becoming aware, guess that is the silver lining in them hosting the World Cup. The world is looking at them a lot closer than before.
Thank you for such amazing work, to you and your whole team. And it&#39;s just sad how, in the end, we&#39;re all slaves of money.
Thank you for all your hard work. Keep up the good job, and always looking for the truth. That‚Äôs why I keep watching your videos.
iys happening all over the world. not only Qatar. sad but true
Yeah, but none of this is exclusive to Qatar or even just the gulf nations. Most countries have ridiculously bad human rights records, particularly in the case of manual, foreign labour. America is no exception.
‚ÄèI&#39;m not supporting Qatar.<br><br>‚ÄèBut, knowing the fact that none of the Europe countries and north and South American countries even letting a migrant worker to go into their country. <br>‚ÄèThey only want master professionals or young students. I don&#39;t support this video in any form whatsoever.<br><br>‚ÄèHe is like teaching the world about slavery and also not even let anyone to get near their borders.<br><br>‚ÄèMe as an Indian immigrant working in UAE.<br>‚ÄèMore than 10 years, sure there is human rights violations there, but we are the one who&#39;s coming here. They don&#39;t force you.<br>‚ÄèIf we want get better wages than your home country , we come to Middle East.<br><br>‚ÄèEuropian and American countries don&#39;t even let us near their borders..
My friend&#39;s uncle died working in one of the stadium. His family was never compensated cause the death was mentioned natural and yeah he was totally heathly before. And the worst thing is the Nepalese government doing completely nothing despite knowing the reality. My friend&#39;s family had tried but their stories never got heard so thank you Johnny for bringing this up.  And yes, the world should never forget that 6500+ deaths.
You are amazing man. I really love your content and will definitely recomend your channel to my colleagues and family members man.
Great work team Johnny!
Why don‚Äôt you make a video about Verdingkinder? ‚Äúcontract children&quot;, or &quot;indentured child laborers&quot; were children in Switzerland who were taken from their parents, often due to poverty or moral reasons, and sent to live with new families, often poor farmers who needed cheap labour.‚Äù
everything is true, i lived in Qatar for 50 years, its all true, its the same with all gulf countries.  and im 35 now, all the 50 years of abuse in qatar has turned me into an alcoholic addict.
You are an absolute legend Johnny. Keeping the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù population informed about corruption and not talked about news around the world. Great mini doc as always.
Very nice video, Johnny and team!
FIFA playing 4D chess with Qatar, letting them organize the world cup so people see how horrible of a country it is. few understand.
for the record these conditions were WAY better than the conditions they left. This is all BS with the debt situation to start but its not really different than us having labor done in their home countries under abysmal conditions and sending the products to us.....can&#39;t say I like the style of this vid.....the beanie kind of says it all.
This is an issue in pretty much every industrial country, you see it all over Europe Asia and Africa, America as well it&#39;s just better hidden and on lower scales
I am from Nepal and my father, uncle and their friends have worked ‚Äúlow-tier‚Äù jobs in Doha, Qatar. I have all the photo compilations of how horrendous the living condition is, painful after stories of family members whose bread winner dies at work. This Video really hit me hard. I know how it feels like to grow up without seeing your dad for 4-5 years, how my father had to work on harsh working conditions, how he had to suffer alone when he got sick because there were no proper health facilities. I know how inhumanely they treat the workers. My uncles used to say, ‚ÄúQatar is a concrete hell‚Äù. Qatar can spend excessively on other non- necessary stuffs but wants to save every penny by degrading the worker‚Äôs condition. Total Shame!
Great video great journalism I think it is very important both to keep the people safe and to get this out to the wolrd
In Saudi Arabia, Bangladeshi workers are work more horrible conditions than Qatar. Same Kafala system exists is Saudi. Arabs are traping our people. As Bangladeshi we have nothing to do, just we can feel sad about it. <br><br>I&#39;m a kind of victim in this trap.
The crazy part is, they can afford easily to give the labourers decent conditions. I think they are scared the labourers will become wealthy and go back to their respective country and invest it all back there.
Love from Nepal üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüá≥üáµ<br>Not only in Qatar but all the gulf countries there are lots of workers who are treated like slaves and sexually harassed by an arabian owner. I&#39;ve been working in Dubai since 2014-2016 (27 months) and I saw all these things. They need somebody to raise voices for them. Maybe your video will help them. God bless you üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
I lived in Doha for 20+ years and this is all accurate and unfortunately a reality everyone who lives there is aware of. The only thing you forgot to mention is that this isn‚Äôt just a Qatar story, the entire gulf region is dependent on the same Kafala system to simultaneously build their nations and maintain the status quo. Bravo for fairly presenting this very sensitive/complex topic.
üëèüëèüëè kudos to you and your teams as well!!!
‚ÄúWith or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.‚Äù
I am from India , a software professional. These kind of things happen normally in gulf nations not just Qatar, all our Indian brothers are treated as slaves. World cup actually put this into spotlight. Our friends go there because of the debt they have here and those who coudlnt complete their degree. Few of them travel to countries like Singapore but not treated like this
Even when US was in Iraq same employment methodologies were used (dept trap, passports taken away) to get workers from India, Bangladesh e.t.c. The same is happening in middle east, as well as in Maldives which I have found out recently on my trip to Maldives. The dark side of hospitality industry in Maldives can also be looked into.
my husband worked in qatar as an engineer. same situation. the salary is 3x lower than what is written in the contract. they said free meal and free accommodation. but nothing!! their house is like a jail!!! he came home with wounds in hand and we can see it in video calls. the passport is surrendered to the agency. he just finished the 2yrs. contract and will never ever return to qatar!!!
This happen in Spain, but they are very good in hiding it,i will appreciate you coming to Spain doing your own recherche and show it to the world.
Dear Johnny, just tell me one thing -- why do you use Apple products when we all know what the working conditions in their sweatshops in China are??? Shouldn&#39;t you at least be boycotting the company if not an investigative report on them.
As someone who lived in Saudi Arabia. It&#39;s the exact same thing. They treat their low income workers horrifically. We often had maids who would come work for us (they were sponsored by a company) and they would only get paid like $1/hr it was insane. We did what we could to help, but the system is out of control.
The criticism against this World Cup, Qatar or FIFA isn&#39;t &quot;Western Propaganda&quot; or &quot;Islamphobia&quot;. We, the people of South Asia have been trying to voice this for a decade now. These are our people who have died, some of them are Muslims too. Its pity that our own governments don&#39;t care and we have to rely on western journalists.<br>Thank you Johnny for this. Its time I pick up my camera too.
Johnny, we have an identical system, with all its components, in Canada for farm workers and other industrial work. In Canada ... recruiters are often gangs in country of origin, recruitment fees, debt required, closed work contract, horrible conditions, death, deportation if you speak out, extortion at home of your pay. Its called the Temporary Foreign Worker Program and its where Qatar learned its system.  If you want to tell this story I can introduce you to all of the relevant contacts - workers, farm access, rights organizers, lawyers, etc.
This is such a professional production, love your work chief! Me and my dad is big fans of football and FIFA and we both agree that going to Qatar to watch the games is not a good idea (seriously theres so much humanitarian/ accomodation issues even for tourist and athletes) thanks for the video Johnny!
How about the contractors? Who are them? Do they know about this situation? Are they involved?
My friend&#39;s uncle died working in one of the stadium. His family was never compensated cause the death was mentioned natural and yeah he was totally heathly before. And the worst thing is the Nepalese government doing completely nothing despite knowing the reality. My friend&#39;s family had tried but their stories never got heard so thank you Johnny for bringing this up.  And yes, the world should never forget that 6500+ deaths.
props to Johnny for spending so much time to show the world what&#39;s really going on, I admire the dedication
Hi Johnny I hope you focus also on Palestine case and what happen in it, really your videos may help them and they need help.
I went to Doha in late 2018 early 2019. I got to see first hand how they treat the immigrants of the country and let me tell you it‚Äôs HORRIFIC. Qataris basically get first dibs on everything and the immigrants get whatever‚Äôs left. Example: if you were an immigrant in a grocery line but a Qatari needed to get in that same line, they would just skip you and treat you like you were in the wrong. The city is beautiful but the outskirts are so under developed. Immigrants get treated bad in a lot of countries but I‚Äôve never seen it as extreme as it is over there. I also got to see the World Cup stadiums being built and the industrialized areas and they were horrid. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs only gotten worse over the years. Glad my mom doesn‚Äôt live there anymore.
Thank you so much for this !
I do really appreciate your work, as most of my families and friends are working on Quatar. Dead by overwork and harsh conditions is the only thing that they have told. Thank you for bringing this up, this is something of so important.
This is the case in Dubai as well, they treat south asians like shit, most PROs in private companies are Emirati and they dont explain shit when you sign employment contracts.
The saddest thing is we can&#39;t do anything about it.
Good job, Johnny. It is impossible to watch a match without thinking about those poor workers and the high number of deaths. I think it has spoiled the world cup for millios of people. And we know no one will answer for all this attrocity. (Roseli, a teacher from Sao Paulo).
This is a deep dive into a disgusting situation.  I love the work you do here.  Unfortunately this isn&#39;t anything new.  This makes me sick.  The whole region has been doing this for a long time.  It&#39;s not just the world cup.  Places like Dubai are literally built by the same system.  I&#39;m sure Qatar has been built the same way.  The world cup supercharged the process for a few years for a specific goal.  The world cup.  But this has been going on in the region in many countries.  Dubai was built the same exact way.
The housing looks quite good, I was expecting tents or something. We still can&#39;t say what happens inside, if they&#39;re are getting enough food and water or not.
Thank you so much for shedding light on this issue. I see so many Arabs telling south Asians to be grateful for the jobs and it makes me so angry. I know with the games starting people have already forgotten these workers. So many outlets covering the games, gloss over this.
Being a Nepali, I can confirm the arrival of people from Qatar with a disappointed face, physically disabled condition and even inside a wooden box sometimes. Even today, I have my own relatives working in Qatar. Thank you Johnny Harris for showing this to the world.
As a football fan, I really admire all the work you have done regarding Qatar and its World Cup. I&#39;m sure Johny will get as big as Vice news. Mark my word.
Live in Kathmandu and have seen our Nepali brothers coming back in coffins and boxes, and their families breaking down and howling at the Tribhuwan International Airport seeing those dead bodies. Most of them still traumatized by the loss of their loved ones. The world will be celebrating for the next couple of weeks but I‚Äôm glad that Johnny Harris and the team behind this independent journalism did their job to show the world what this world cup in Qatar actually means. Always an admirer of this kind of journalism and the research the team does in bringing out the content. Thank you for this video üôèüèª
I was in Doha a few years back and saw the condition of these workers first hand. The story covered in this video brings back episodes that ultimately made me leave the country. Unlike me, the construction workers couldn&#39;t change jobs or leave the country and were bound to their employer. So grateful and relieved that the situation is coming to light and the world knows about this now. Johnny, I have become a fan of your work with this video. Wishing you the very best for all your upcoming work.
The real accomplishment wasnt him getting over the mountain, it was him getting nominated for an Emmy. So incredibly proud of you Mark, youre an icon for us small creators to show where we can all go if we just keep trying. Thank you for everything and I hope you get that award you so deserve! :)
It&#39;s so sad that these things continue to happen to the most vulnerable people. Thank you for shining a light on this.
You imagine yourself in that place of those workers living out there, I can feel the pain those workers are being exploited in a way that they themselves cannot do anything about it. Absolute power corrupts absolutely and that is what is happening in this world. People should respect even the lowest grade people so that he feels respected... I blame those govts whose people have migrated... They should take action against Qatar or any other states that does these kind of exploitation
Being a Nepali, I can confirm the arrival of people from Qatar with a disappointed face, physically disabled condition and even inside a wooden box sometimes. Even today, I have my own relatives working in Qatar. Thank you Johnny Harris for showing this to the world.
I was in Detroid, New Orleans, Paris, and more cities and I saw worse things there.
Poverty forces people to continue working for these countries. International bodies seem to have no teeth in making real change - economic sanctions would be laughable for such a rich country. I find it hard to see this positively.  What is the solution??? Anyone?
As a football fan, I really admire all the work you have done regarding Qatar and its World Cup. I&#39;m sure Johny will get as big as Vice news. Mark my word.
Thanks Johnny and team for bringing this to light. We would have never known the plight and horrifying conditions in which these men had to live and work for years. I just hope Qatar is held responsible for inhumane work environments once these few weeks have passed.
Johnny, you‚Äôre pushing the envelope for YouTubers. This is Netflix doc quality being published for free as the events are unfolding in real-time. Bravo.
I feel you should&#39;ve never say what he does because they can narrow it down on those people coming on the site <br>  Just saying
You are an absolute legend Johnny. Keeping the general population informed about corruption and not talked about news around the world. Great mini doc as always.
Hi Johnny, thank you to you and your team in doing this dangerous behind the scenes. I live in the US now but I grew up in the Philippines and all of my family still lives there. These has been an on going treatment for migrant workers in these countries, Qatar, Kuwait, Hongkong etc. Hopefully one day you and you&#39;re team will be able to feature a story that would change the world. To dig deep on how horrible, mistreated and underpaid all migrant workers coming from the 3rd work country. They take people&#39;s rights by keeping their passport so that they will be stuck and have no way to leave. Not to mention, sexual and physical abuse in women workers in these countries, there are so much to it and I hope you guys will not stop now and will keep going.
Johnny, as always incredible piece of journalism! Props to you and your crew for shining a light on this topic.
Seriously, immense credit to your guy on the ground &quot;Raj&quot;. It sounds like a miracle that he came out unscathed and did an excellent job. Also well done to everyone involved who were able to capture this story so honestly and truthfully. Never stop bringing the real world to the light Johnny.
Johnny, as always incredible piece of journalism! Props to you and your crew for shining a light on this topic.
Amazing reporting. I was born in Malaysia. I see similarities here with the construction sites in Malaysia--stories of Bangladesh nationals having their passport taken away until their passage and recruitment costs were paid, terrible living conditions in shacks built IN the hard-hat construction sites, having to walk miles to just get rice. Thank you for shedding a light on this.
If you already revealed what and how you wish to proceed, means they will expecting you and.....welcoming you. üò≥
As someone who was born and raised in Qatar, AND has literally been to the industrial area on foot. I can confirm that most of this is quite common knowledge. Most people are aware of the fact that these labour workers or labourers are treated quite harshly with abysmal working conditions. The footage you&#39;ve collected is quite accurate and it&#39;s impossible not to notice living there. Every where you go, you could see them working on the side of the road and on buildings wearing the uniforms even in the heat. There are a lot of parts of the city, especially industrial area where you have huge labour camps. But the thing is, it&#39;s so normalisied that it doesn&#39;t really stand out or seen as that big of a problem. It&#39;s sort of just accepted. This is the case for most gulf countries, where you have a huge portion of the labour class essentially just segregated, and the kafala system is a rapant problem and a huge human rights issue across the region. Qatar has a huge immigrant population, mainly to reach it&#39;s 2030 goal and vision for the future. Seeing as most of the infrastructure for those projects have already been completed, it&#39;s a bit too late. The damage has been done. The fact that Qatar is an incredibly rich country and could&#39;ve easily paid these workers fair wages yet they chose to actively exploit them for as cheap as possible baffles me.
Unfortunately my own uncles are trapped in Kafala system and because of our ignorant government of Nepal. They have no proper facilities there. Its good to see you guys shedding light on this problem. Now more  people will get to know the dark reality of these industries. Thank you guys means alot. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The most accurate video I&#39;ve seen till now. I live in Qatar since 2008 and I know. Well since then the worker conditions has been improved and in my point of view it still needs improvement. In my personal opinion yes Qatar has made great progress since then till the world cup but it still needs to instill more humain laws and I&#39;m guessing within the next 5-10 years it might reach there hopefully.
Thanks Johnny and team for bringing this to light. We would have never known the plight and horrifying conditions in which these men had to live and work for years. I just hope Qatar is held responsible for inhumane work environments once these few weeks have passed.
I grew up in Kuwait (country next to Qatar) for my entire life and this is very accurate. Migrant works (specifically from India and the Philippines) are literally treated worse than animals. At one apartment I lived in, the security guard told me his passport was confiscated and he could never return to India to see his family. It&#39;s heartbreaking to see no action taken to such treatment. It really is modern day slavery
Can we simply take a moment to congratulate how much time and passion he put into these vids?<br>It&#39;s incredible, and I consider they justify much more than that!  :-
It&#39;s just a shame that corporations don&#39;t have the guts to sponsor your content. Would love to see you grow as large as organisations like Vice or Radiolab so that you have even more resources and eventually a team of reporters. This is what journalism should be so please keep it up. I&#39;ll keep supporting where I can. Thank you for your hard work!
Can we simply take a moment to congratulate how much time and passion he put into these vids?<br>It&#39;s incredible, and I consider they justify much more than that!  :-
This is incredibly informative information. I give you and your team a lot of credit for bringing this to Light and showing the world how the rich continue to treat the hard-working or should I say extremely hard-working, poor people of the globe.
This is incredibly informative information. I give you and your team a lot of credit for bringing this to Light and showing the world how the rich continue to treat the hard-working or should I say extremely hard-working, poor people of the globe.
Just discovered you Johnny and love what you do. People need to see the dark side behind industries and entertainment, amazing how we consume without knowing or considering the damage to individual&#39;s.
Qatar butchered poorest of poor...  and world fraternity watched it happened in silence..
This is incredibly informative information. I give you and your team a lot of credit for bringing this to Light and showing the world how the rich continue to treat the hard-working or should I say extremely hard-working, poor people of the globe. <br>I must say as a student of history, I have seen this behavior in other parts of the world. Starting with great Britain to France more recently in Europe and North America mostly United States and Canada. By no means I‚Äôm trying to give a free pass to countries like Saudi Arabia Qatar Dubai and UAE but these countries have been taught by notoriously cruel teachers and they‚Äôre just simply Following those Road Maps provided to them by the teachers mentioned above. The people suffering through these practices have not changed unfortunately.<br>You should continue to bring light to these atrocities committed against the less fortunate of the world - most certainly, not point a finger at one
Thanks Johnny and team for bringing this to light. We would have never known the plight and horrifying conditions in which these men had to live and work for years. I just hope Qatar is held responsible for inhumane work environments once these few weeks have passed.
You should ask a question. If the situation is so bad why their country allowed them to go to Qatar and work there??
Johnny, we have an identical system, with all its components, in Canada for farm workers and other industrial work. In Canada ... recruiters are often gangs in country of origin, recruitment fees, debt required, closed work contract, horrible conditions, death, deportation if you speak out, extortion at home of your pay. It‚Äôs called the Temporary Foreign Worker Program and its where Qatar learned its system.  If you want to tell this story I can introduce you to all of the relevant contacts - workers, farm access, rights organizers, lawyers, etc.
I lived in Qatar in the late 80s and 90s. It‚Äôs full of very discriminatory practices based on race and economic background. There were multiple times poor people of my own race would approach my family for help to escape their plight because we were  well off and lived in one of the best neighborhoods that housed white collar workers that worked for the royal family. We lived like we live in America, but the minute we left the special compound that was zoned for us, the quality of life dropped steeply. The most shocking among the rescue requests my family carefully handled was a woman whose passport was taken from her as as part of her ‚Äúemployment‚Äù as a maid. Clearly she had been abused because her skin had welts and burn marks from cigarettes. It wasn‚Äôt just Qatar. The whole Middle East with their oil money are quite horrible unless you‚Äôre rich. I don‚Äôt know why the rest of world continues to reward these people when they treat others so badly. Ive only even driven EVs every since they were an option. I feel awful that our government even allows investment from these people in American businesses when they have such horrible moral values of their own with no intentions of changing anything.
This is not true. Why Qatar at this particular time, your intention is not helpping workers but you got paid to do that to make Qatar is  bad country and violate human rights. I DARE you you do such report about Israel and how do they treat falatini famileis.
This system is actually all around the world. Another commenter said it about farm workers in Canada, and KnowingBetter did a crazy video on &quot;When was the last slave in the US?&quot; the answer, frighteningly enough, was just after WWII, and indentured labor is basically still a thing.
I was in Dubai a few years ago. The foreign workers there who helped build say the Burj Khalifa‚Ä¶they were bused an hour and half to an area with horrible living conditions. Very same conditions as Qatar! 6-8 men in a very small room with no AC or heating. Very unsanitary conditions and they had to surrender their passports. Just horrible treatment of these men who were so desperate to just help their families.
As a privileged Indian person who grew up in the ‚Äúwhite collar‚Äù family zones of Qatar, it‚Äôs not just shocking to see this unfold but extremely disturbing and unethical behaviour by the government. We need more independent journalism and compassionate reporting. Thank you Johnny! ‚ù§
Appreciated üëç
I do really appreciate your work, as most of my families and friends are working on Quatar. Dead by overwork and harsh conditions is the only thing that they have told. Thank you for bringing this up, this is something of so important.
Yes, this is the kind of journalistic coverage that I&#39;ve been craving for for a loooong time.<br>Deep investigation, raw, risky journeys, and all for the truth to come out.<br><br>Thank you for this Johnny and team.
Thank you for your work, Johnny. You do such good work. Didnt this same thing happen once in a S. American country when they had the Olympics?  I wish I could remember the country. A documentary was done on that one also!  Keep us posted! Stay safe my friend!
Can You please do a research on china &amp; show the world how muslims are being tortured &amp; trapped in china.....in xinjiang<br><br>HELP THEMüíî
I find it extremely unlikely that you didnt know about these migrant camps before you made this video and then pretending that you discovered this area while randomly looking at city planning maps and that you knew nothing about them but felt they were suspicious completely unbelievable and at worst completely fraudulent given that this has been in the media for years and one quick Google search of Doha industrial zone or Labour City will give years of news articles on this subject from both international and Qatari news sources.<br><br>This is honestly just blatant disregard for journalistic integrity and an obvious push to jump your own ego. Lies like this damage your credibility when it comes to aspects you may be speaking the truth on. But it&#39;s all about those clicks, media outlets and youtubers like you are only jumping on the hot topic bandwagon to draw clicks. If you or the media really cared, you would have been constantly pushing stories since Qatars bid or over the last 12 years since they won the bid. announcement
Hi, Jonny , I am big fan. I wonder if you can make a video about How Mohammar Gaddafi was killed and why he was killed. I really want to learn. There are several video out there online but I doubt they contain actual facts. Thanks so much. It would be much grateful.
üëèüëèüëè kudos to you and your teams as well!!!
The European are spreading rumors.
theres 30 minutes crap cherry picked videos like this for Qatar but none for US, Russia or China major events, then theres the Piers Morgan interview based on facts and reality without double standards.
You are amazing man. I really love your content and will definitely recomend your channel to my colleagues and family members man.
This happen in Spain, but they are very good in hiding it,i will appreciate you coming to Spain doing your own recherche and show it to the world.
How about the contractors? Who are them? Do they know about this situation? Are they involved?
Hey Johnny, thank you for the coverage. It&#39;s really eye-opening how massive the exploitation is. It baffled me the extent humans will go to exploit others. It&#39;s got nothing to do with religion, race, skin color, etc. I mean they obviously have the means to provide a better working condition, wage system, and recruitment system, but they refused to do so just because they can. JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN. They consciously make profit out of people&#39;s suffering just because they can.
Thank you for such amazing work, to you and your whole team. And it&#39;s just sad how, in the end, we&#39;re all slaves of money.
Thanks!
Thank you so much for this !
And the fact is .. Johny making some YouTube money  bcz of qatar üá∂üá¶ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠
they did the same thing to brazil during the olmypics
with the hard work these labourers have they should have reinvested the money they made in qatar and go to europe illegally
Stop spreading rumours, you&quot; the American and Europeans&quot; are the last to teach us humanity, take a look on your terrorism in Iraq, Palestine, Algeria( last century) then speak.
The crazy part is, they can afford easily to give the labourers decent conditions. I think they are scared the labourers will become wealthy and go back to their respective country and invest it all back there.
everything is true, i lived in Qatar for 50 years, its all true, its the same with all gulf countries.  and im 35 now, all the 50 years of abuse in qatar has turned me into an alcoholic addict.
Hey man love ur video but your sponsor is a scam you can‚Äôt actually own land in Scotland that‚Äôs just 1ft square that‚Äôs against the law there and don‚Äôt don‚Äôt plant trees either man please get better sponsors they also are the same company for those fake  Japanese knives that‚Äôs made bye a china company please research
my husband worked in qatar as an engineer. same situation. the salary is 3x lower than what is written in the contract. they said free meal and free accommodation. but nothing!! their house is like a jail!!! he came home with wounds in hand and we can see it in video calls. the passport is surrendered to the agency. he just finished the 2yrs. contract and will never ever return to qatar!!!
Poverty forces people to continue working for these countries. International bodies seem to have no teeth in making real change - economic sanctions would be laughable for such a rich country. I find it hard to see this positively.  What is the solution??? Anyone?
This is an issue in pretty much every industrial country, you see it all over Europe Asia and Africa, America as well it&#39;s just better hidden and on lower scales
This systematic slavery nothing new same thing done in Dubai
Oh please people!! Yes maybe things are not perfect or right in Qatar but please tell me where in the world or what country out there that doeshave something that is messed up please tell me ...  Stop pointing fingers and let&#39;s all look in our own backyards instead &amp; since we&#39;re all here pretending to care &amp; we&#39;re passionate &amp; eager to<br> insult other nations,  here&#39;s an idea, what if we all eagerly put that passion towards fixing all bad or wrong in our own backyards and we can then make the world a better place. Instead of sitting here gossiping like little you know what. Love you all and from the bottom of my heart god bless
What‚Äôs her name?
Why haven&#39;t you investigated Patreon?  There&#39;s a boatload of nefarious activities going on with them. You&#39;re such a good journalist I&#39;m sure you know this. But I guess that story gets put on the back burner because it hits in the wallet. Just saying
Do the same report on western countries look at every major city in the US.<br>Who are you to determine human rights
Its all a circle<br>Kashmiri pay at the india<br>India pay to Qatari<br>Qatari (arab) pay to America<br>Americans to Isreal<br>Isreal to Europe<br>Europe to Russian...
Research into WorldCup<br><br>Flies Qatar Airways.<br><br>LMAO!!!
Dear Johnny, just tell me one thing -- why do you use Apple products when we all know what the working conditions in their sweatshops in China are??? Shouldn&#39;t you at least be boycotting the company if not an investigative report on them.
Qatar have less population that‚Äôs why most of the the people working on building stadiums are immigrants,meanwhile in 2018 Russia used slavery and forced their people to work in harsh conditions but no one talks about it but Qatar gets the whole blame only because of one reason they are an ‚ÄúISLAMIC COUNTRY‚Äù even FIFA‚Äôs president infantino mentioned it in an interview. And about LGBTQ, every country have their own rules and regulations if you can‚Äôt follow the rules then just don‚Äôt go there respect every country and their rules. this is what football is all about ‚Äúrespect‚Äù and of course you guys are scratching your balls beacuse your European country didn‚Äôt get to host the current World Cup üò¢
they have a roof at least,...
The housing looks quite good, I was expecting tents or something. We still can&#39;t say what happens inside, if they&#39;re are getting enough food and water or not.
keep to support Palestine guys üëçüôÇ
Great video great journalism I think it is very important both to keep the people safe and to get this out to the wolrd
üñ§
Qatar is not   bad as  Saudia arabia and Dubai.  Saudi Arabia worse than anything
They have there short comings just like every country in the world.  They have modernized so much in 12 years that no country in the world has matched there speed and progress.  Give them time they will be better then the rest of the world in the near future.  Stop criticising Qatar and criticis your own short comings.  I am fed up with all this negative news why cant you focus on there positive side and report that . Every time I see a documentary on Qatar it&#39;s all ways the negative side stop messing with Qatar because you gonna need to warm your homes and work places.
Just bcoz it&#39;s the reality of religions n that nowadays its already happening n that the west n USA n etc r taking over n making themselves the bosses with USA makes the head.. that the reality even u ACCEPT or DENIED..
Corruption is in every country. Especially the USA
Really..!! Wow we really already living in the end time.. plz revert to God.. knw war is God n who is God n where Is God..  ask urself thing ?s n mk ur owns each n
looks like someone is mad about anti lgbt
What do you expect when the civilised world meets the dark ages.
Hi Johnny I hope you focus also on Palestine case and what happen in it, really your videos may help them and they need help.
The more a country is developed, the more something is kept secret, as in places like China, where Muslims are treated like dogs, in Pakistan, and many more. What we don&#39;t know is because of corruption, money, and government. Shame on this society, which is built on greed.
I have a question <br>Have u say anything report about what&#39;s happening in Palestinian people ove 60 years <br>Millions of Muslims genasid in China <br>The complete countrys of iraq and Afghanistan swallowed by Western countries with no reason and excuse <br>People are dieing every single day in Palestine including innocent  children women bombing by Israel government <br>So if u really honest journalist who want to show to the  world humans seafaring ?<br>If yes then show me the proof of it so that I  at least believe  some of your wards and gree with those who  called a hero journalist <br><br>But if u become a hero only to the Qatar then I&#39;m sorry sir <br>So if u r reply a man show the equality of humanity and u spoke to all innocent people who really seafaring all around world <br>Show me anything <br>Have u sayd anything the same when over 50 countries came together and swallowed iraq and Afghanistan <br>If u really defending a human right wow is very good and I&#39;m totally with sir but is it in Qatar? That&#39;s my question <br>I&#39;m sorry sir as English it&#39;s not first language as u otherwise will explain for u what I whant say <br>OK bye
We are humans and we don&#39;t live hundreds of years so at least be kind to one another
You need to investigate Santo Domingo. They keep a lot of Haitians prisoners the living conditions is horrible. A piece of bread and a little of soda. No bed please do it for the love of God
Mening this shit is 10 times better netflix RESPECT BRO üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
I‚Äôd like to play devil‚Äôs advocate for a few points. Not all are paying a recruitment fee. I wish they would clarify that. Next, their housing looks a lot better than many American neighborhoods. Finally, why wouldn‚Äôt they designate the immigrants to LIVE in a specialized section? They don‚Äôt prohibit their travel, only living quarters. Don‚Äôt Americans also have immigration barracks? The workers are not forced. Each of their stories start with ‚Äúwe were in a financial crisis‚Ä¶we needed money for a healthcare issue.‚Äù They have chosen to work abroad, as hundreds of thousands do, for an opportunity to better their living situation. It takes hard work and sacrifice to pull oneself from the gutters and they have chosen this. They could leave and be jailed. But the prison system would treat them humanly and send them back home. The only issue is the nonpayment. That is a very specific issue that one should take up with those supervisors. This is not a Qatar issue. This is offering an opportunity that they were aware of. These immigrants don‚Äôt have air conditioning at home let alone when they are working outside in the same exact environments at home. I really wish journalism would not just cover ONE SIDE! They should also cover the side of the children that received their life-saving surgeries due to the financial opportunity Qatar has offered. People have bought land and are finally out of the slums. There is a completely different side to this story that you have failed to cover.<br><br>Qatar is an extremely giving and humble country. They exploit no one. They have always assisted other people and countries at no benefit of their own. <br><br>Sincerely, <br>One Humble American
This is the case in Dubai as well, they treat south asians like shit, most PROs in private companies are Emirati and they dont explain shit when you sign employment contracts.
Please also make a video on sex trafficking and the 2006 world cup in Germany.
You forget to mentioned that these people are imported my Indian and Philippines company and payed European and America companies. So the first who mistreated and take advantage of these people are white Europeans company. So please be honest ans show the hall picture
nO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT MEXICAN WOMAN WHO WAS BEATEN 100 TIMES JUST FOR PROTEST!!! QATAR IS RULED BY DEMONS!! ALL THAT SHEIKS ARE DEMONS!!!
In America they treat Mexican worst then this <br>White ppl Krazy
You should ask a question. If the situation is so bad why their country allowed them to go to Qatar and work there??
when will you cover on what‚Äôs going on in china ?
inta majnoon
This is just terrible and disturbing to watch, how in the world can people treat others like this, how do they sleep at night. Terrible terrible terrible.
These people are being offered jobs that you won‚Äôt offer them in ur countries in stead u will let them starve to death that‚Äôs the only thing I can say , grow up ur minds
Will you release a statement or something regarding your established titled sponsorships? They are an absolute scam, and are actually trying to get away with it.
U guys r on a mission to fail the fifa in Qatar . But u will always fail to do so. This happenes every where in world. So have to work on it  internationals which includes western countries too. But right now, look in to Belgium and Argentina violence situation where ppl r burning bikes, tires on roads to condemn their teams who has defeated by Muslim countries so west is anger.
Welp, John Oliver didn&#39;t cover any of this AND you scooped the story too.
not only Qatar in Europe as well
Quatar might be at fault for mistreating migrant workers but on which moral high ground do you sit on spreading the negatives of quatar and not shading light on the western disasters they have brought to this world. colonisation, wars, racism...... Please stop this nonsense
My uncle fell into this trap but in Dubai decades ago, I got to see his families&#39; living conditions once and it was haunting, a full apartment the size of an American parking space, I felt so sorry for them but there was nothing we could do as they were trapped, I was moreso angry with myself for being so ignorant, thankfully they were able to move into a better space recently
This is all common knowledge. Nothing new. I&#39;m not sure why people are shocked by this. People from those countries (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sudan, Egypt, etc) know what the situation is like and they still choose to go because they need the money. Nobody is forcing them to go, and dying while working outside is not uncommon in the summer. I&#39;m from Iraq and people literally die walking down the street due to heat every summer. Actually, even students in Iraq die of heat in the classrooms because classrooms do not have ACs. So, yeah. Nobody is being forced to do anything. Don&#39;t blame some lucky rich people for your misfortunes. Also, the stadiums were built by American companies.... But people have to hate on Qatar because it&#39;s an Arab Muslim country and you know what? it&#39;s nothing new, we&#39;re used to it, so hate all you want.
Lolll cry if you don‚Äôt work with the state of Qatar, it‚Äôs OK bring the charcoal to winterüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Good story unfortunately nothing will change at all
This is the sad truth. Not just Qatar, It seen in Brazil &amp; Africa too...they boarded up the poverty areas near the stadiums back then
The double standards<br>...
should of just went in with a iphone camera i would if been a little more stealth
This is happening all around the world .
I&#39;ve heard about this issue in Dubai as well many years ago in the early 2000s. Glad that more people are becoming aware, guess that is the silver lining in them hosting the World Cup. The world is looking at them a lot closer than before.
Tell us about Europe too police brutality, racism this things happen all over the world, My question why do people keep on going there?<br>Tell us about LGBT this isn&#39;t news or is it because it&#39;s an Islamic country? Watch football and go home! If anybody doesn&#39;t feel welcome in one&#39;s house they stop going there. Period!!
Qatar butchered poorest of poor...  and world fraternity watched it happened in silence..
I see similar things in Europe. What‚Äôs the big deal ?
wow
I feel you should&#39;ve never say what he does because they can narrow it down on those people coming on the site <br>  Just saying
And who in the world supports all of this?<br>We know.
Qatar royal family owns al jazeera and Aj plus.
This happens in U.S.A too
The video kind of gets started around 17 minutes
simple question .. why the poor labour dont go to your country instead of qatar ?
Cool! Now do China.
Great work team Johnny!
you dont have mony to go  i feel sory fir you i can give you some mony to go
‚ÄúWith or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.‚Äù
I&#39;m not going to defend Qatar, but Canada even did some evil stuff for the Olympics in Vancouver. They were sending homeless off on one way bus tickets.
Everyone is chasing the dream , and no one is looking at the big elephant in the room. POPULATION EXPLOSION !
Hey üëã johnny <br>Can you make a video form Iran üáÆüá∑ ?
Johnny can u an explainer video a out the civil war in yemen
This channel don‚Äôt care about human right , they never talk about Syria or south Sudan ,, it Political driven and use human right as excuse for there own benefit. Human emotion not wapen used against your enemy.
Yeah, but none of this is exclusive to Qatar or even just the gulf nations. Most countries have ridiculously bad human rights records, particularly in the case of manual, foreign labour. America is no exception.
basically how the dirty system run the whole entire mainstream world for a while now lolz fiat currency lolz
iys happening all over the world. not only Qatar. sad but true
Really good. Now do this for Area 52.. :)
It&#39;s on FIFA&#39;s shoulders.
