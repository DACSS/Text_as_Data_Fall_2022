People die in deferent  countries  not just in Qatar.ü§®üíú you must  think straight .
More than the kafala, I blame the governments of India and Nepal for not providing enough employment for their own people.
American has killed millions of children, in the war on Iraq, no one cared, once you have power.
Don‚Äôt want to go to a place someone died to build yet they buy stuff kid worked hard to build in poor countries
The football fans could care less! If they cared they wouldn‚Äôt attend . . . but they gotta drink and be loud.üßê
corrupt country with its corrupt people.. they recruited workers from abroad (who had to pay a fee) but then these workers got in debt.. seems like a great country to visit
If you&#39;re going to make men work like that, you better have the health, nutrition and food supply for them.
The reality is that noone really cares. The games are going on and there was nothing done about the human rights violations. Also the second the last whistle blows no one will care again, not that they do now. They should be allowed to have their beliefs and also shunned by the rest of the world, which will never happen anyway, so they win all around.
I love how everyone complains now but not 12 years ago when the same exact thing was happening already, it‚Äôs just ironic that no one cared before last year when hundreds were dying, what you think the buildings all appeared now? They‚Äôve had slaves for decades and when the people were complaining no one cared, stop being a preacher when the job was already done you should‚Äôve said something 10 years ago when this was public it‚Äôs not new.
It is so sad to hear about human rights abuse in Qatar. I would also like to mention about the human rights violation that western countries caused in countries like Afghanistan. Where was the German team when innocent peoples lives were lost in Afghanistan when the west was grabbing areas were lithium was found. They went into Afghanistan for their own interest. Like they did invading all other parts of the world
Could those employers be charged with crime against humanity ?
How do u prove that 2 people are in a relationship in court n not just friends without video proof of intercourse lol you look gay your going to jail tf wants to visit this hell hole
Nobody should watch the world cup
Who really voted for the world cup to take place in the dessert needs to be jailed
Hosting the cup in a place with scorching heat where you have to spend crazy amount of money to cool the entire stadium instead of uhhhh.... hosting it in a cooler country
I think the higher authorities made a mistake by giving Qatar rights to host world cup , for hosting they had to build up new stadiums and buildings , the FIFA should&#39;ve given rights to a country where the resources should&#39;ve already been there and the revenue generated is very less compared to the total cost not to mention about human rights and also paying David Beckham a huge amount I mean stupidity at it&#39;s highest.... Hope that this won&#39;t happen again.
I have a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è<br>After this FIFA, for what purpose this big stadiums would be used for?
<br>-Women must cover themselves in respect of the culture, and religion.ums some of them are Muslim, they are afraid to have them drink or spilled on them. You can drink at your hotel if you want but keep it away from the public.
Quatar is based, quit this communist lgbt crap.
football turned into a political arena for developed western nations to mock other countries
So FIFA stood up against racism, against black slavery and equality for years. Now, when modern slaves built these stadiums, over 6000 people were killed, where gay people are being punished, where human rights are being abused daily, they celebrate the sport.<br><br>Qatar has never been a soccer nation, however they are the host of the tournament. <br>Qatar‚Äôs team is the only team in the history of sport who lost its first match as an organizer. <br>Their culture is against our culture, they dont let you drink alcohol in the stadiums. Unless you are in the VIP section. Yes, you can drink alcohol over there. Allah does not see what is going on in the VIP. The billionaires can drink because they are rich, the average Joe is not allowed because of their culture.. <br><br>Most of the visitors are from the US, Europe, South America. They probably are not muslims. The Quran does not allow muslims to drink alcohol. But most of the visitors are not muslims. <br><br>Qatar and their corruption, human rights abuse, culture makes me sick‚Ä¶ <br><br>I dont really care about soccer but this is awful.
It&#39;s all in your perspective. Yes as a result of the world cup 6500 people died. That is below the bar we set and say that it is unacceptable, which it is. But according to this, there was significant progress, as FIFA said, and I agree. Would those laws had passed if the world cup was not there? Will it stay this way? Then we begin to play the all the what-if scenarios. We dont know but as the trend of the world rights gets better then third world countries do, yet there will always be countries under the &quot;bar&quot; because our expectations rise with progress
Qatar is far more violent in terms of their governance. No wonder, still Middle East is a Beast continent.
Hellooo‚Ä¶.We dont know what 85 Fahrenheit is‚Ä¶.please translate to most of the planet‚Ä¶.
over 200 billion and didnt win a single game wow i know somebody is mad
I heard from many of my friends that they were treated like black slaves there. The employers were devilish
What about israel and Palastine? Where‚Äôs your human rights? Please shout the fu** off
Democracy ought to be a requirement.
What&#39;s crazier? Qatar finishing with the wooden spoon as hosts while the USA is in the knockout stages.
Don&#39;t forget the the bribe money for the corrupt fifa ü§≠
$220 for someone whos working on a life and death situation, $277 million for a guy who just fronting his face for the event. fuccc
No amount of work is worth the lives of people. This is honestly disgusting and should be a bigger issue. The companies should be paying the families for the lives lost of their lost ones while working for them in inhumane conditions.
Evil, cesspool!
Islamic country with human rights abuses? No way.
Shame on all the people that will promote this shameless genocide (that‚Äôs on since the rise of the gulf countries) by going to the matches, watching them on tv and/or buying shit from the world cup. This is just giving money back to them and accepting and reinforcing it to happen again and again. What a disgusting place to live. What a horrible country (countries really) to visit and travel. If the rest of the world crossed them maybe then would start changing or would just wither slowly as nations. Shame too on the pathetic clown of Beckham for accepting to be the face of this bs show. I can see and understand many female artist deciding not to go and perform there and standing up. I wish more artist did that. Yuck ü§Æ
This video is dumb nobody cares about the people, we‚Äôre watching the cup anyways and sitting in the stadium happily
I don&#39;t like your video.<br>It&#39;s all about about anti islamic and unisex.
Britain should stop criticising and critiquing other countries growth and so called human rights abuses and focus on themselves.too hypocritical.
229 Billion dollars spent in the process of hosting the world cup and 17 Billon dollars is the estimated revenue during the world cup. Why will any county do that?
Why did nations send their national teams to go play in Qatar given the human rights abuses.
It&#39;s one big giant lie, and nobody truly knows who&#39;s benefitting from it anymore. Ouroboros. The wealthy elite keep hindering their own power, while the poor keep chasing a dream that doesn&#39;t exist. Once the lie collapse&#39;s, and the system ceases to exist, all these rich people who are dependent on workers to survive (to farm resources), will vanish. People don&#39;t work for money, they work for the idea of what money can offer, security, till the illusion collapses. If you truly are as smart as you think you are, and if you are &quot;successful&quot;, why does your entire life exist around collecting debt instruments, and even more so now a days, numbers on a electronic screen with no tangible value, just arbitrary value? We all believe in one big lie. Ouroboros.

I can&#39;t watch world cup this year
That lady is a Kung Fu master? üòÜ
Victimhood is the biggest business on the planet!
As a middle east person who worked in construction field, this feels no wonder. This is the common system in these developing &amp; under developed countries in middle east. &quot;Rich becomes much richer, poor goes more poor&quot;  But, can the western world gives this much easy job opportunities, does gives full safety &amp; respect the workers
Qatar spent 209 billion or so just to make back up 17 billion??
Soooo ‚Ä¶ they have that amount of money to build stadiums but  can‚Äôt find a way to fix world hunger in poor countries?
We, the west, talking about corruption in Qatar, hahahaha, lol, hahahaha. Soooo ridiculous. Nancy Pelosi for example, never had another job in her life and she is half a billioniere. And on and on and on. {&quot;a&quot;:0,&quot;b&quot;:6,&quot;c&quot;:205,&quot;d&quot;:214,&quot;e&quot;:{&quot;a&quot;:&quot;Hypocracy&quot;,&quot;b&quot;:205,&quot;c&quot;:214,&quot;d&quot;:[&quot;HYPOCRISY&quot;,&quot;HYPOCRATS&quot;],&quot;e&quot;:[],&quot;f&quot;:[]},&quot;f&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;g&quot;:false,&quot;h&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;i&quot;:false} to the highest level
Hats off to business insider. Such a masterpiece üëèüëè
60 americans died uilding the world trade centers, 23 people died building the empire state building..Thats ok in the name of a white countries progress and modernization. When Arabs build its not ok.
I am all in for LGBTQ and alcohol ban. We should respect other cultures and religion. But how are you gonna explain this. Is this alright in the eyes of allah
Qatar is funding radicals in other countries
Very good videos showing the sufferings of the labour workers and the struggle they face but must not ignore the brutal killings of the people all around the world done by the USA for Israel,just look at Palestine where‚Äôs there military occupation,land theft,massacre,ethnic cleansing,oppression and open air prison(NOT CONFLICT)done by Israel backed by USA.If you really care for human rights please see what the west is doing.Thanks
2020 saw me sell a few houses, and I&#39;m waiting for a housing catastrophe to strike so I can acquire on the cheap. I&#39;ve been considering stocks as a backup plan in the interim; do you have any advice on the timing of a purchase? I keep hearing that the market is a madhouse and a dead cat bounce right now, but on the other side, I still see and read about traders making over $225k a week. Why is that?
The <b>only</b> good thing about this world cup is Argentina&#39;s victory.
This really takes the fun away from the World Cup
Yo por eso no veo esa basura de f√∫tbol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALeYFi_1hg&amp;t=0m58s">0:58</a> i am from india and the video started reporting a death of an fellow indians sad üòî
So all the migrant workers can&#39;t go home? I doubt it. Sounds like propaganda.
I am sure if it was European country they will hide the truth
The only reason why you‚Äôre criticizing is because you‚Äôre jealous!
My deepest condolences to all the migrant workers to accomplish the dreams of the few. And FIFA turning their head to the other side about this situation just to make more money is a shame.
Who the fu*k you are ,üò°üò° why you showed wrong map of India in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALeYFi_1hg&amp;t=2m39s">2:39</a> , INDIA map is not complete without POK( pakistan occupied kashmir) and Aksai chin , both bullshit countries (pakistan, china) have forcefully occupied our (India ) area as India is country who always wants peace that&#39;s our mistake . Anyway but always remember to show right map of India üáÆüá≥
BOYCOTT the QATAR world cup, it&#39;s a CORRUPT SCAM!
Great that they are making steps towards fixing it but it still not enough hopefully they will do more. I give them credit it a marathon not a sprint.
Literally 2018 was held by Russia while Putin was killing Syrians labyians Egyptians in sina Muslims in shishan ....ect every funking day non of you MF even whispered about it this is not about human rights do not treat us like we are stupid there must be a reason for this media switch a political one. one 100 per cent this is planned cause usually unfortunately no body cares about the human rights record of any country.<br><br>But I guess putin was good until he stared killing fair skinned blus eyed Ukrainians üòí
This is so f***ing wrong on so many levels. My god
How many people died in the industrial revolution in America
Like my comment if you think muslim nations should be banned from hosting international events
Disgusting.
Shame on Qatar n FIFA, How can FIFA give a chance for such a small Country. Quite FIFA in Qatar....
The only thing here I don‚Äôt like west people they can only see law and rights on other people countries but when comes to they side they never speak anything and they always don‚Äôt like reported for they actions on tvsüòÖand most bad things west reporters they only add salt on wounded people on tvs but they will never help them than keep saying what they only going through
Every Emerald City is built on the backs of poor labor...since the beginning of time. Admire the feats of man but be assured many died for it. No one is exonerated...every nation past and present are guilty  of this.
Is funny how they believe so much is Allah but they can&#39;t even do this simple thing. Goes to show how real Allah is. Is all BS and lies.
How about the true cost of today‚Äôs USA/England or any colonizer countries. The western world has violated basic human rights throughout the world and has no ground to point out other nations when they‚Äôre doing something good. Hypocrites.
The west is so out of touch they act so shocked about the tragedies that take place in undeveloped countries. It‚Äôs redundant
How sad that they are already eliminated
Unfortunately, the Middle East is synonymous with human right violations
Numerous human rights violations, and a shady history.... and people are outraged about the beer.
YOU WORK FOR 40YRS TO HAVE $1M IN YOUR <br>RETIREMENT, MEANWHILE SOME PEOPLE ARE PUTTING JUST $10K IN A MEME COIN FOR JUST FEW MONTHS AND NOW THEY ARE MULTIMILLIONAIRES.......
While we thank the human rights group for the voices they raise from Qatar and elsewhere, however as a  humanity we need to hold the same standards everywhere. The abuses and violations from or by the West are justified each time, or limited to lip service. While the rest of the world is dictated what the West wants. What the West has done by invading nations, killing innocent civilians, and let them die when they flee war zones as refugees. What has the West done for Uyghurs?  Also, when will the Western world realise that there are other cultures, beliefs and value system, when the bullying of Western system end? Neo-colonisation needs to end.
If it‚Äôs about human rights then There should never be a World Cup held in Israel US etc
Gays are disgusting what are you trying to promote
These are few unfortunate cases from the millions that are happy and have build mansions in india
Karma will strike
Since I knew what football is, I have hated it. Everything feels wrong about it. Too much money for people kicking an object. New stadiums who do get a permit to use assigned farm areas instead of housing or for real farming purpose. even corruption was easier explained through this medium than politics. If you can&#39;t fool a 6 year old, you shouldn&#39;t be able to fool anyone. And now this <br>I did follow the World cup just for my country, but since previous edition I quit entirely. We made non-existing mistakes and the opposite made the most clear and precise targeted mistakes yet they were not in the wrong. And so we lost the semi-final.<br>Just go back to being a sport. This is not a sport, this is everything but a sport
ban the fu*king world cup
Why do we act like this is a new thing every time the world cup comes around?
FIFA you suck about to boycott it
Surely surely they could have interviewed one just one of the actual worker that worked in the stadiums..... Just Bullshit western propaganda.....
Ignorance is bliss
Yo im working in QATAR, and i tell you guy this is not the case..
shit happens lol
Stop propaganda stop islamophobia what your Ancestors doing with Red Indian in USA and massai tribes in Africa whole world know it?? Jealousy to Qatar because Qatar host Islamic culture in FIFA
Qatar played well but sadly lost
Its admirable what HR Watch are doing pointing out the real costs of the World cup. But I have not heard a word from Minky Worden &amp; her HR Watch on the racism encountered by Africans fleeing Ukraine in Germany, every day. The racism meted out on Africans in Italy, in France, every. <br>What about the racism Palestinians have to endure every single day of their lives, supported by Israeli Apartheid laws in occupied  Palestine??  <br>What about the Americans &amp; their &quot;War on Terror&quot;?
My dad was a victim of this kafala system in the UAE as a private driver for an Emarati family in 2008. His sponsor (an individual who happened to be an airport official) kept his passport and one fine day just cancelled his visa without any notice. He had 30 days to pack up and leave after living 30 years in the country. The worst part is the sponsor wouldn&#39;t give him his passport - he was handed the passport at the airport during departure and we realised later that he was placed on a permanent ban to not being able to re-enter the country again. I was left heartbroken and not sure how my father felt as he always hid his emotions and never opened up about it. I went to the local immigration office to find out the reason behind the ban and if it could be lifted but was told that the only way to lift the ban was by the sponsor. It almost felt like they knew what had happened but seemed like they couldn&#39;t do much about it. A country where I was born and raised, it felt like I had no place there although I speak local Emarati Arabic including reading and writing and also know the culture and traditions well. This left a permanent mark in my heart for which reason I left the country in 2016, never to set foot in it again.<br>The entire gulf region behaves in a similar way with slight variations, some better or worse than others. In my experience, the people of Oman and Bahrain are more real in the sense they do not look down on people from those migrant nations.
What a painful üò£ reality behind this beautiful tournament. In their opening ceremony, they should take a moment to remember those workers who had lost üòû their lives in order to build these stadiums.<br>Rip to all workers.
Happy to see that somebody is talking about the people behind the scenes who is making the world cup a reality
My teacher used to work as an engineer in a very big firm that worked mainly in Qatar. When asked why he left, he said, &quot;Poor working rights. They get a building done in a day, but the amount of people that die and the amount of families I had to call saying that their family member had died. Was outrageous.&quot;
It&#39;s not just that the World Cup in Qatar was a bad idea, it&#39;s that building a huge sprawling metropol in the middle of a scorching desert, where all the money comes from oil and 2/3 of the service sector is about cooling things down... is insanity.
I am from Mahottari, Nepal and its really painful to see our people being enslaved by these tyrants.
I think the higher authorities made a mistake by giving Qatar rights to host world cup , for hosting they had to build up new stadiums and buildings , the FIFA should&#39;ve given rights to a country where the resources should&#39;ve already been there and the revenue generated is very less compared to the total cost not to mention about human rights and also paying David Beckham a huge amount I mean stupidity at it&#39;s highest.... Hope that this won&#39;t happen again.
I have a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è<br>After this FIFA, for what purpose this big stadiums would be used for?
Hosting the cup in a place with scorching heat where you have to spend crazy amount of money to cool the entire stadium instead of uhhhh.... hosting it in a cooler country
It is so sad to hear about human rights abuse in Qatar. I would also like to mention about the human rights violation that western countries caused in countries like Afghanistan. Where was the German team when innocent peoples lives were lost in Afghanistan when the west was grabbing areas were lithium was found. They went into Afghanistan for their own interest. Like they did invading all other parts of the world
In a way , the worldcup had a positive effect. The issues of migrant workers in middle East countries were always there ... Way before the world cup was announced.<br><br>This actually brought attention to the issue and is blowing a wind of change...
My deepest condolences goes out to all the families and people personally affected by such conditions. In my opinion I think FIFA and the host nation should be held accountable as they should of continued to monitor and do regular checks for human rights, equality and the wellbeing of each person working there regardless of race or gender from the looks in this documentary seems like still nothing was done to compensate the lose of lives, safety and total disregard of life. Peoples greed has made them worse than animals, this starts from the people in high positions both in the nation‚Äôs countries and FIFA it‚Äôs self.
Let&#39;s not forget, when in England most of the stadiums were built, 20-30 years ago. They never had safety equipment then, who knows how many people died, yet we still sit in our stadiums.
The irony is they can afford to pay 270 million to David Beckham but not compensation to those poor workers
Could those employers be charged with crime against humanity ?
I like to Thank all Human Right commission, news outlets, Soccer Teams and western folks who have raised voices for the basic rights of my people for meeting basic conditions. Where my Government didn&#39;t even cared for its own people you guys stood up<br>Once again Thankyou
I still remember watching the news in 2014 about Qatar will be hosting the 2022WC. How time flies..
People die in deferent  countries  not just in Qatar.ü§®üíú you must  think straight .
Hats off to insider for bravely exposing Qatar‚Äôs sinful deeds.
Really appreciate your effort for presenting world the other side of the Qatar world cup 2022 which has been neglected ever since.
What‚Äôs also surprising is how it was revealed that Qatar paid loads of money to rig and host the World Cup, and it was still allowed. Instead of choosing around country. There‚Äôs a reason why the World Cup wasnt being host in the Middle East, guess money is always a factor to change minds.
I love how everyone complains now but not 12 years ago when the same exact thing was happening already, it‚Äôs just ironic that no one cared before last year when hundreds were dying, what you think the buildings all appeared now? They‚Äôve had slaves for decades and when the people were complaining no one cared, stop being a preacher when the job was already done you should‚Äôve said something 10 years ago when this was public it‚Äôs not new.
Was really happy and mesmerized that how Qatar is building stadiums and all ,preparing for the big event but now getting to know all of this really breaks heart .They should really have not done this to the poor people, they were in need of their bread and you clearly cheated them? And why not compensation but advertising madly to earn more ?<br>Heat related issues can be now dangerous for the players. I think the world or fifa is really gonna regret this choice of country. <br>Not a Qatar fan any more!<br>Condolences to the families... :(
The saddest thing is that no matter how many of these reports come to light, how many symbolic protests the teams make that in the end they only take advantage of the issue because if they really wanted to protest they would do things like not attend but of course that is unthinkable, that for the next World Cup/Olympics a similar story will repeat itself.
Disgusting how they can spend BILLIONS , but then treat the workers like slaves. They obviously have more than enough money to pay them fairly, and to compensate the families, but they just don&#39;t want to.
I was there in 2015 when some of the World Cup buildings had already been constructed, and even then there was news and concern of worker conditions.
Who really voted for the world cup to take place in the dessert needs to be jailed
Thank you for addressing this issue. Please keep doing the same until FIFA takes strict actions
&quot;fans don&#39;t want to sit in a stadium that workers died to build&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that, we&#39;re talking about die hard football fans here. I&#39;m pretty sure most of them are more worried about whether or not it&#39;s going to be difficult to buy beer. The teams are quite clearly prepared to play in these stadiums that workers died to build, shouldn&#39;t they be leading by example?
Like they said Qatar had 12 years to finish their infrastructure. After living there for many years, I know lots of projects still haven&#39;t been finished (This is a 12 days before the world cup begins)
Hats off to business insider. Such a masterpiece üëèüëè
This is the best video by business insider, indeed an eye openerüôèüèªüëåüèªhats off to the teamüôèüèª
Thank you Buisness Insider for showing the world about the reality .. Thanks a lot
shame on Qatar. Thank you for bringing this to light. No one should have to work in such conditions.
If you&#39;re going to make men work like that, you better have the health, nutrition and food supply for them.
As a middle east person who worked in construction field, this feels no wonder. This is the common system in these developing &amp; under developed countries in middle east. &quot;Rich becomes much richer, poor goes more poor&quot;  But, can the western world gives this much easy job opportunities, does gives full safety &amp; respect the workers
It may sound crazy but when I was in India, my monthly salary was about 40$. If I had the chance to make 200$ a month I‚Äôd have signed up in a heartbeat to do anything. Sad, but these workers knew (including the chances of dying)what they were signing up for, people die at construction sites not only in Qatar getting paid way less. I‚Äôve seen people die at work, there‚Äôs not a lot of safety rules and regulations companies are abided by in a lot of third world countries. I‚Äôm glad this World Cup shines some lights on the issues
I&#39;m from Nepal and it makes me so sad for the situation of my country people and my neighbouring countries people who had to leave their respective countries for employment and lost their lives abroad because of modern slavery and poverty
I‚Äôve worked there and if you work for an International company then you get treated well,if you work for a local company then you will always get paid late and are always underpaid. <br>I can understand why these workers have such a hard life!<br><br>They pack the staff in staff accommodation and sometimes there are about 8 people in 1 room on bunk beds!<br><br>Very hard life those people have as the working class in Qatar!
The reality is that noone really cares. The games are going on and there was nothing done about the human rights violations. Also the second the last whistle blows no one will care again, not that they do now. They should be allowed to have their beliefs and also shunned by the rest of the world, which will never happen anyway, so they win all around.
More than the kafala, I blame the governments of India and Nepal for not providing enough employment for their own people.
We have a problem. We take sports events too seriously (as if this was life itself) and this shows our depravity and emptiness. We forget that world cup tournaments are all vanity.
This happens not only for World Cup, it happens for the Olympics as well
What i got out of this is such grand scale events should be conducted in the countries that have means to it OR FIFA should have stricter laws. I&#39;m sure they were informed of every plan and progress Qatar made, yet they decide to turn a blind eye is concerning.
Seeing things from a different perspective, I can‚Äôt forget how ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù card is played everytime something is not in accordance with the agenda. True human rights violations are never shown.
It is very said hearing such stories, but the important thing is that how can we in a long way help to solve such menace? Proper measures should be taken and make that they work. Not always just talking about it without taking a step to stop it.
This just makes me so angry and sad for my countrymen. Human lives are significantly more important than sports-entertainment and the outcry on this isn&#39;t loud enough.
I commend your video that brings attention to the plights of the workers! May there be justice in this world! I would like to see the Human Rights Commission look into this in detail!
Never knew this was the case. Thank you for this video üò¢
Forget about human rights violations for a second, Can someone please explain why FIFA ignored middle eastern weather at the time of awarding this event?<br>Unbelievable!
I live inCanada this happens in Canada too . Some Employers never paid to employees..people get paid below minimum wage. This happens in western countries but in an organized manner
Thanks for opening my eyes on this. Great doc. Rest in peace to those who perished...
Why did nations send their national teams to go play in Qatar given the human rights abuses.
The workers who come from India, Bangladesh or other countries knows the working environment in Gulf countries but yet they take a risk, no one forces them to come and work......if you want to blame someone then blame those countries who forces their citizens to go to these countries for work  !!!
It makes me sick and angry that this is common knowledge and yet my colleagues, friends and coworkers are watching and cheering for their team in this blood tournament.
Congratulations Qatar and FIFA you&#39;ll be happy and celebrating your success but the people who lost their Lives and their poor family will never be happy again ü•∫
The two top teams in final, should walk away, and play wherever, whenever on a &#39;neutral field&#39; and call it a day.
From Nepal: we lost our people but Qatar  will be enjoy the on the occasion of Fifa World Cup, RIP for my people.
Thanks for exposing these hypocrits. Every single human life matters. Not just celebrities. I am curious to see if any football legend ignores this or they will have guts to speak against it.
My deepest condolences to all the migrant workers to accomplish the dreams of the few. And FIFA turning their head to the other side about this situation just to make more money is a shame.
Firstly, RIP to those who lost their lives.<br><br>It‚Äôs a real shame that most people won‚Äôt come together to boycott this atrocity.
While we thank the human rights group for the voices they raise from Qatar and elsewhere, however as a  humanity we need to hold the same standards everywhere. The abuses and violations from or by the West are justified each time, or limited to lip service. While the rest of the world is dictated what the West wants.

I&#39;ve been considering stocks as a backup plan in the interim; do you have any advice on the timing of a purchase? I keep hearing that the market is a madhouse and a dead cat bounce right now, but on the other side, I still see and read about traders making over $225k a week. Why is that?
As a nepalese, i am truly saddened to see this happen. thank you business insider. for showing what truly happened.
I know it would be somewhat problematic to ban countries from competing in the hosting of the world cup due to their infrastructure and geography but this should have been done. You should never for example attempt to host the Winter Olympics in Dubai.<br>Form an infrastructure point of view first and from an environmental. It is not that Dubai cant create snow slopes in the middle of the desert, it is that it should not.<br><br>This is all disregarding the human rights abuses.
The awarding of hosting privileges should be a circuit as opposed to a bid.  this will give countries enough time to prepare as well as include all countries and regions in a manner that resonates with the spirit of the game. Bidding only sidelines some of the best countries that are willing to host a truly humane event devoid of human rights violations but are limited by their inability to have a resource pool at a moment&#39;s notice they can draw from in the few years of preparation provided by FIFA. A circuit of willing hosts would tackle this issue.
As a big fan of soccer and I&#39;m looking forward to the world cup it is sad learning about this
Awesome opportunity for organizations wash money efficiently‚Ä¶ and since it‚Äôs a growing country not much strict rules ‚Ä¶ sure corruption must be huge over there !! But congratulations project got done üî•
I am glad this is getting coverage amidst all the glitz and glamor on tv
These middle East countries innovatively use Technology  to transform desert into Oasis. I can&#39;t imagine sitting in an air conditioned football stadium in the scorching heat of Qatar. Way they are growing french grass in the desert is amazing.
This happens all over Gulf Cities including Dubai as well. It‚Äôs sad.
The football fans could care less! If they cared they wouldn‚Äôt attend . . . but they gotta drink and be loud.üßê
This problem was first exposed around 9 years ago.<br>Yet people are only finding out about it now.
Thank you Business Insider for this video, No one covered this topic
Videos like these breaks my heart. I was in Qatar working in a housekeeping department inside the Gas plant when they won the bid. I knew Qatar winning this bid means many Nepalese migrant workers gonna have to sacrifice their life and health.<br><br><br> How can people be so self -centered  and inhumane. Why do you need lots of expensive cars , lots of bungalows, jewelry , tons of expensive clothings. Why don&#39;t you cut your expenses and give some of your money to those in extreme needs. Why is everyone wants to possess more than what they actually needs. How can people be so much greedy, biased and unthoughtful. Slavery still exists in the world. My countrymen have been exploited everywhere in the world. But in middle east there is too much of discrimination and bias. The people who are actually very good with soil, mud, bamboos, woods. People who knows how to take care of nature, how to make compost, how to build nursery, how to fix soil, how to grow crops/vegetables, organic food are landless and forced to go the middle east and work as a low paid construction or factory worker. Majority of migrant workers from Nepal destroy their health, loss their life and still the situation of their family remain same. Middle east pays a lot to the people from, europe , america and form other developed countries. They built their country by totally exploiting poor humble hard working people from countries like Nepal. Its a shame. Feels so bad to be Nepali sometimes. I wish i could help those migrant workers and create Job opportunities in Nepal. If i had the money equal to the value of just one, out of  many expensive car owned by a teen ager Qatari, i could build a unique permaculture farm that could create jobs and feed more than thousand people. In ten years i could build another farm and fix another degraded place. <br><br>Why can&#39;t rich people think for others ? The true purpose of life is to help dammit. Why do you need so much  when some another human like you, some family like yours are deprived of basic needs of life and literary dying. If you hire someone to work for you then its your responsibility to make sure that, they eat, sleep and live well , their family eat well, study well, live well. If you don&#39;t think about your employee&#39;s family and future then you are a tyrant. A tyrant will fall down sooner or later.
The real heroes are not the team that will win, but those who lost their lives building this stadium. RIP Brothers. That&#39;s how the world works.<br><br>Edit: Alot of people are saying they are victims, and that is true. They are not &#39;heroes&#39; in the literal sense that they went out of their way to do some act that is heroic, but just saying they(and their families) deserve attention or at least compensation from people in the upper hierarchy.
‚Äò‚ÄôCourage taught me no matter how bad a crisis gets ... any sound investment will eventually pay off.&quot;
Huge respect to Business Insider
If David Beckham donated all of that money to the families who lost their loved ones, he would gone down in history as one of the greatest and respected men in history of football and humanitarian. But sadly he is not a selfless guy, so he decided to keep the money. Greed!
Great that they are making steps towards fixing it but it still not enough hopefully they will do more. I give them credit it a marathon not a sprint.
No amount of work is worth the lives of people. This is honestly disgusting and should be a bigger issue. The companies should be paying the families for the lives lost of their lost ones while working for them in inhumane conditions.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ALeYFi_1hg&amp;t=11m17s">11:17</a> by that logic the US and the UK should not be allowed to host the World Cup either the middle is in ruins because of them.
Irony this has been happened for 12 years, but it can only be opened and shared now. Which I believe once the event ended, this story will fade away, but not with the suffering of these families.
Crazy how they didn&#39;t even pay these workers. Under the glitzy surface it is a very dark place.
I&#39;ve come to accept that in this world, the big boys are the top players. And regardless of how many times stories like this surface, the big boys always win without consequences for their inhumane actions.
A human life is precious than any amount you can think of .
229 Billion dollars spent in the process of hosting the world cup and 17 Billon dollars is the estimated revenue during the world cup. Why will any county do that?
I remember spending a whole year in Qatar while in the military...that was 2 years before they won the World Cup, and 99% of the country was nothing bet desert, and whatever people i seen living there were all migrant workers, poor, over worked, and severely under paid...and many of those same people worked for our forces, and they were all treated like üí©...only &#39;Qatari&#39; people lived well...its was sad, and i can honestly say that I know that the conditions these people lived in were terrible...these are &quot;modern day&quot; slaves...smh...something should have been done way sooner!
that was some seriously informative news. good job
Not just qatar , this sponsorship thing happens in all of the gcc , mainly because of the entry of indian, Bengali Pakistani and nepali workers agreeing to work for minimal to minimal wages
I&#39;m &quot;definitely happy&quot; to see world class players play and celebrate this huge sporting spectacle in infrastructure made through harsh labour, cheating on poor workers and death of thousands of souls that just wanted to pay for their families basic needs. There&#39;s no point in being a rich nation if this is how u treat other nations people even if they are labourers üòî
Thank you for documenting this.
<b>I‚Äôm so happy I made productive decisions about my finances that changed my life forever. I‚Äôm a single mother living in Melbourne Australia, bought my second house in September and hoping to retire next year at 50 if things keep going smoothly for me.,,....*</b>
I like to watch this immediately after I watch the news tell me Twitter is treating their employees unfairly.
I am a fan of football. This documentary is a perfect job even though small group of people see this tragedy.
In Qatar, government projects are awarded to big contractors - mostly managed by foreigners. They hire workers from overseas through agents in south East Asian countries. The agency takes fees from the companies/contractors. As a result Contractors expect the workers to not work elsewhere once the workers arrive in Qatar.<br>The government cannot control every single recruitment happening in the private sector - which is run by foreigners themselves.<br>For decades, workers have been coming to Qatar from south east Asia willingly (nobody forces them on planes). The workers knows that conditions in their countries (and in Europe) are worse than in Qatar.<br>If the Europeans are sincere about those south East Asians, then they should hire them in Europe.
Infantino&#39;s Qatar chant is amazing!
Despite it being a sporting spectacle, there is no positive economic impact for any host.
Thank you Insider for bringing attention to this. They are doing far worse things than what you uncovered. Keep up the good work.
Why is this a surprise? Every time a country and city wins the &quot;privilege&quot; to host a major sporting event- disaster follows.
