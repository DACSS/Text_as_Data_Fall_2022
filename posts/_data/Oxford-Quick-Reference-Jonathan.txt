Concise Colour Medical Dictionary

To find an entry in this e-book you can:

• Browse the Alphabetical List of Entries and select the entry you would like to view

or

• Use your Search function to be taken to a complete list of references to your search term in the Dictionary ◦ If your search term has its own entry, it will usually be listed at the top of your results

◦ In cases where your search term appears in more than one entry heading, the results will be listed alphabetically





A note on special characters

While most e-readers can display special characters (such as é and â), many cannot search for words containing them, unless the special characters themselves are typed into the search box. If you are unable to type these characters, please browse for your term using the Alphabetical List of Entries.

Preface


The seventh edition of this dictionary provides full coverage of all the important terms and concepts used in medicine today. Written by a distinguished team of practising specialists and medical writers, it is intended primarily for workers in the paramedical fields: pharmacists, physiotherapists, speech therapists, social workers, hospital secretaries, administrators, technicians, and so on. It will also be invaluable for medical students and provides a useful reference for practising doctors. Each entry contains a basic definition, followed – where appropriate – by a more detailed explanation or description. A feature of the dictionary is that the articles are written in clear and concise English without the use of unnecessary medical jargon. For this reason the book will also be of both interest and value to the general reader who needs a home medical dictionary.

The dictionary defines terms in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics, as well as in all the major medical and surgical specialties. Entries for medicinal drugs are given under their recommended International Non-proprietary Names (rINNs); where these differ from the names commonly used in Britain, the latter are included both as synonyms for the rINNs and as cross-reference entries (see below). Coverage of psychology and psychiatry, public health medicine, endocrinology, and dentistry is unusually comprehensive, and this edition includes some 250 new entries covering the latest developments in cardiology, radiology, and medical genetics, as well as the other medical and surgical specialties. Coverage of medical ethics has been considerably increased, and the public health entries have been extensively revised to take account of the latest changes in the NHS. Another feature of the book is the Appendices, which include (among others) units of alcohol, lists of inherited medical conditions, and doctors’ training grades (updated in light of the new IMT programme); the Abbreviations and Online medical resources sections of the Appendices have also been thoroughly updated for this edition.

To avoid cluttering the entry list with derivative words (e.g. adjectival forms of nouns that are defined), these words are listed at the end of the definitions of the words from which they are derived. Where necessary, articles are supplemented by clear and fully labelled line drawings. An asterisk against a word used in a definition indicates that this term has its own entry in the dictionary and that additional information can be found there. Cross-reference entries simply refer the reader to another entry, indicating either that they are synonyms or abbreviations or that they – together with related terms – are most conveniently explained in one of the dictionary’s longer articles. Synonyms and abbreviations are shown in brackets after the defined term.

a


a- (an-) prefix denoting absence of; lacking; not. Examples: amastia (absence of breasts); amorphic (lacking definite form); atoxic (not poisonous).

A & E medicine accident and emergency medicine: an important specialty dealing with the immediate problems of the acutely ill and injured. See also ED.

AA see Alcoholics Anonymous.

ab- prefix denoting away from. Example: abembryonic (away from or opposite the embryo).

abarticulation n. 1. the dislocation of a joint. 2. a synovial joint (see diarthrosis).

abasia n. an inability to walk normally for which no physical cause can be identified. The patient displays normal motor ability when sitting or lying down, suggesting that a psychogenic reaction may be involved (see conversion disorder). Astasia-abasia (also known as Blocq’s disease) is abasia with the inability to stand.

abatacept n. a *biological therapy that inhibits overactive T-lymphocyte stimulation of the immune response. It is used for the management of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis to treat joint pain and swelling, improve quality of life, and prevent joint damage. Side-effects are rare but may include infection, allergy, and headache.

abbreviated injury scale a quick method for determining the severity of a case of serious trauma. It can be used for purposes of *triage and *clinical audit.

abciximab n. an *antiplatelet drug (a *monoclonal antibody) that is used as an adjunct to lessen the chance of a heart attack during surgery to open blocked arteries of the heart (see coronary angioplasty). Side-effects include bleeding, nausea, chest and back pain, and headache.

abdomen n. the part of the body cavity below the chest (see thorax), from which it is separated by the *diaphragm. The abdomen contains the organs of digestion – stomach, liver, intestines, etc. – and excretion – kidneys, bladder, etc.; in women it also contains the ovaries and uterus. The regions and quadrants of the abdomen are shown in the illustration: the four quadrants, demarcated by broken lines, are the right upper (RUQ), right lower (RLQ), left upper (LUQ), and left lower (LLQ). Terms to designate the regions are those used in day-to-day medical practice rather than in anatomy textbooks. —abdominal adj.

Regions and quadrants of the abdomen.





abdomin- (abdomino-) combining form denoting the abdomen. Examples: abdominalgia (pain in the abdomen); abdominothoracic (relating to the abdomen and thorax).

abdominal dehiscence see burst abdomen.

abdominal migraine a condition characterized by intermittent central abdominal pain that may be associated with nausea, and often vomiting. It usually occurs in children between the ages of three and ten years and is more common in those with a family history of migraine headaches. Typically these children develop migraine headaches when they are older.

abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre) a manoeuvre for the treatment of choking in which the patient is held firmly around the midriff just under the ribcage. The hands of the rescuer are held as a fist and short sharp thrusts into the patient’s upper abdomen are made in order to dislodge the obstructing article from the airway. This manoeuvre should not be performed on children under the age of one year.

abdominoperineal resection surgical excision of the anal sphincter, rectum, and part of the sigmoid colon because of cancer involving the anal canal or the lower third of the rectum. The remaining length of sigmoid colon is brought through the abdominal wall (see colostomy; stoma). This procedure may be performed using abdominal and perineal incisions or laparoscopically; it is indicated for tumours close to the anal canal and in patients with poor sphincter function.

abducens nerve the sixth *cranial nerve (VI), which supplies the lateral rectus muscle of each eyeball, responsible for turning the eye outwards.

abduct vb. to move a limb or any other part away from the midline of the body. —abduction n.

abductor n. any muscle that moves one part of the body away from another or from the midline of the body.

aberrant adj. abnormal: usually applied to a blood vessel or nerve that does not follow its normal course.

aberration n. (in optics) a defect in the image formed by an optical device (e.g. a lens). In chromatic aberration the image has coloured fringes as a result of the different extent to which light of different colours is refracted. In spherical aberration, the image is blurred because rays from the object come to a focus in slightly different positions: the rays passing through more peripherally are bent more than those passing through centrally. This occurs even with monochromatic light.

abfraction n. a form of non-carious tooth-tissue loss manifesting as notching at the neck of a tooth. It is thought that this is caused by the forces placed on the teeth during biting, chewing, and grinding, resulting in flexion and the separation of the enamel from the dentine at the *cemento-enamel junction.

abiotrophy n. degeneration or loss of function without apparent cause; for example, retinal abiotrophy is progressive degeneration of the retina leading to impaired vision, occurring in genetic disorders such as *retinitis pigmentosa.

abiraterone acetate a drug used in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer resistant to hormonal treatment. It reduces testosterone production in prostate and adrenal tissues by inhibiting an enzyme, cytochrome P450 17A1, involved in the androgen-producing pathway in these tissues (see anti-androgen). Side-effects include oedema, liver disorders, hypertension, and low potassium levels.

ablation n. 1. a technique in which tumours or other abnormal areas are destroyed using thermal energy, whether by heating or freezing (see cryoablation). It is commonly used with liver tumours, kidney tumours, lung tumours, and abnormalities of the heart conduction system. Large thyroid goitres are also now ablated to reduce their size, with very good cosmetic results. In *radiofrequency ablation (RFA) radiofrequency waves are passed through a needle placed in the target area, which agitates the atoms and produces heat at the active tip. 2. more generally, the removal or destruction of tissue or an abnormal growth by surgery, hormones, drugs, etc. For example, hormonal therapy is an alternative to surgery for the treatment of breast cancer when the patient is not fit for resectional surgery. In dentistry hard tissue can be removed by erbium laser ablation, with or without water spray. See also endometrial ablation; radioiodine ablation.

ablepharia n. absence of or reduction in the size of the eyelids.

ABO system see blood group.

abortifacient n. a drug that induces abortion or miscarriage. See mifepristone; prostaglandin.

abortion n. 1. (induced abortion, termination of pregnancy) the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus at a stage of pregnancy when it is deemed incapable of independent survival (i.e. at any time between conception and the 24th week of pregnancy). One of the most commonly performed gynaecological procedures in the UK, it must be carried out within the terms of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Two doctors must agree that termination of pregnancy is necessary, either (a) under 24 weeks, if continuing the pregnancy poses a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children, or (b) over 24 weeks, if the woman’s life or health is seriously in danger or if there is a substantial risk of severe disability in the child if born. The woman must be provided with full information about the methods of termination available so that she can give *informed consent. Over 90% of terminations in the UK are performed under 24 weeks, and most of these under 12 weeks. Early medical termination (using drugs, e.g. *mifepristone, *misoprostol) carries less risk to the woman than later surgical termination (e.g. *vacuum aspiration, *dilatation and curettage). The 1967 Act was never applied to Northern Ireland, where the law remained far more restrictive; measures to decriminalize abortion in the province took effect in October 2019. 2. (spontaneous abortion) see miscarriage.

abortus n. a fetus, weighing less than 500 g, that is expelled from the uterus either dead or incapable of surviving.

Abrams–Griffiths number (bladder outlet obstruction index, BOOI) a mathematical index used to estimate the degree of bladder outlet obstruction (*BOO). It categorizes patients as being obstructed, unobstructed, or equivocal.

abrasion n. 1. a graze: a minor wound in which the surface of the skin or a mucous membrane is worn away by rubbing or scraping. 2. the non-carious loss of hard tooth substances caused by external mechanical factors (i.e. not by chewing or tooth-to-tooth contact). It is commonly associated with an aggressive toothbrushing technique and is enhanced by *erosion. 3. any rubbing or scraping action that produces surface wear.

abreaction n. the therapeutic release of strong emotion commonly associated with a buried memory. The therapist may help the patient to retrieve the memory (sometimes through hypnosis), which is accompanied by the release and discharge of tension and anxiety associated with it; this is supposed to rid the memory of its power. This intervention is now largely obsolete in psychological practice. See repression.

abruptio (ablatio) n. separation.

abruptio placentae (placental abruption) bleeding from a normally situated placenta causing its complete or partial detachment from the uterine wall after the 24th week of gestation. Abruption is often an unanticipated emergency, as a small bleed (*antepartum haemorrhage) can suddenly evolve into a major abruption and *disseminated intravascular coagulation. Abruptio placentae is often associated with hypertension and pre-eclampsia.

abscess n. a localized collection of pus and necrotic tissue anywhere in the body, surrounded and walled off by damaged and inflamed tissues. A *boil is an example of an abscess within the skin. The usual cause is local bacterial infection, often by staphylococci, that the body’s defences have failed to overcome. In a cold abscess, due to tubercle bacilli, there is swelling, but little pain or inflammation (as in acute abscesses). Antibiotics, aided by surgical incision to release pus where necessary, are the usual forms of treatment.

The brain and its meninges have a low resistance to infection and a cerebral abscess is liable to follow any penetration of these by microorganisms. The condition is fatal unless relieved by aspiration or surgical drainage.

absence n. (in neurology) see epilepsy.

Absidia n. a genus of fungi that sometimes cause disease in humans (see phycomycosis).

absorption n. (in physiology) the uptake of fluids or other substances by the tissues of the body. Digested food is absorbed into the blood and lymph from the alimentary canal. Most absorption of food occurs in the small intestine – in the jejunum and ileum – although alcohol is readily absorbed from the stomach. The small intestine is lined with minute finger-like processes (see villus), which greatly increase its surface area and therefore the speed at which absorption can take place. See also assimilation; digestion.

abulia n. a lack of will and initiative resulting in the inability to act or make decisions independently. It occurs in neurological diseases involving the frontal lobes and/or *basal ganglia, such as *traumatic brain injury, stroke, and dementia. Abulia is also seen in psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. It is a disorder of motivation and may result from dysfunction of the *dopamine-mediated reward system.

abutment n. (in dentistry) the supporting component of a dental *bridge or *implant.

ACA see Affordable Care Act 2010.

academic health science network (AHSN, academic health science centre, academic health science system, academic medical partnership) a regional partnership between one or more academic institutions (typically universities) and one or more health-care providers (in England, typically foundation trusts) with a twin focus on promoting economic growth in the region covered and improving the health of the population. Many AHSNs also include third-sector and industry partners and most have a role in providing education and training. The fifteen AHSNs across England were established by NHS England in 2013 and represent a national expansion of the earlier Academic Health Science Partnerships (AHSPs), which were first set up in London in 2007.

acalculia n. an acquired inability to make simple mathematical calculations. It is a symptom of disease in the dominant *parietal lobe of the brain. See Gerstmann’s syndrome.

acamprosate calcium a drug used, in conjunction with counselling, for the maintenance of sobriety. Patients must already be abstinent at the beginning of treatment. The most common side-effect is diarrhoea.

acantha n. 1. a spine projecting from a *vertebra. 2. the *backbone.

Acanthamoeba n. a genus of amoebae commonly found in dust, soil, and fresh water. Several species can cause serious infection of the cornea, usually resulting from the use of improperly sterilized contact lenses (which may have been cleaned with tap water, for example).

acanthion n. the tip of the spine formed where projecting processes of the upper jaw bones (maxillae) meet at the front of the face.

acanthocyte n. a red blood cell (erythrocyte) with abnormal projections of the cell membrane giving the cell a thorny appearance.

acanthosis n. an increase in the number of *prickle cells in the innermost layer of the epidermis, leading to thickening of the epidermis. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by papillomatous growths, mainly in the armpits, neck, and groin, giving the skin a pigmented appearance and a velvety thickened texture. It may be associated with internal malignancy. Pseudoacanthosis nigricans is more common and is associated with obesity and *insulin resistance.

acapnia (hypocapnia) n. a condition in which there is an abnormally low concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. This may be caused by breathing that is exceptionally deep in relation to the physical activity of the individual.

acarbose n. see alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.

acardia n. congenital absence of the heart. The condition may occur in conjoined twins; the twin with the heart controls the circulation for both.

acariasis n. an infestation of mites and ticks and the symptoms, for example allergy and dermatitis, that their presence may provoke.

acaricide n. any chemical agent used for destroying mites and ticks.

acarid n. a *mite or *tick.

Acarina n. the group of arthropods that includes the *mites and *ticks.

Acarus (Tyroglyphus) n. a genus of mites. The flour mite, A. siro (T. farinae), is nonparasitic, but its presence in flour can cause a severe allergic dermatitis in flour-mill workers.

acatalasia n. a rare inborn lack of the enzyme *catalase, leading to recurrent infections of the gums (gingivitis) and mouth. There are two variants: Japanese (Takahara disease) and Swiss (asymptomatic).

acceptor n. (in biochemistry) a substance that helps to bring about oxidation of a reduced *substrate by accepting hydrogen ions.

accessory muscles muscles of the shoulder girdle and chest wall that (in addition to the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm) are utilized during *respiratory distress to help the flow of air in and out of the lungs. Use of these muscles can be a sign of the degree of difficulty that the patient is in, for example in cases of asthma or *airway obstruction.

accessory nerve (spinal accessory nerve) the eleventh *cranial nerve (XI), which arises from two roots, cranial and spinal. Fibres from the cranial root travel with the nerve for only a short distance before branching to join the vagus and then forming the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which supplies the internal laryngeal muscles. Fibres from the spinal root supply the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles, in the neck region (front and back).

accessory pathway an extra electrical conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles, anatomically separate from the *atrioventricular node, that predisposes to *re-entry tachycardia. The pathway conducts faster than the atrioventricular node, giving rise to pre-excitation recognized by a characteristic delta wave at the beginning of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram in normal rhythm. The presence of this pathway, with the occurrence of intermittent tachycardias, is known as the *Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

accident n. a traumatic incident involving any part of the body. Accident & emergency (A & E) medicine is a specialized area of patient care dealing with acute illness.

accommodation n. adjustment of the shape of the lens to change the focus of the eye. When the ciliary muscle (see ciliary body) is relaxed, suspensory ligaments attached to the ciliary body and holding the lens in position are stretched, which causes the lens to be flattened. The eye is then able to focus on distant objects. To focus the eye on near objects the ciliary muscles contract and the tension in the ligaments is thus lowered, allowing the lens to become rounder. Adjustments in *convergence also contribute to accommodation.

accommodation reflex (convergence reflex) a reflex that occurs when an individual focuses on a near object, in which the crystalline lens becomes more convex, the pupils constrict, and the eyes turn inwards.

accommodative insufficiency a weakness of accommodation as a part of the ageing process or as a result of injury, disease, or the effect of medication.

accouchement n. delivery of a baby.

acebutolol n. a *beta blocker drug used to treat high blood pressure, angina pectoris, and irregular heart rhythms. Possible side-effects include breathing difficulty, especially in asthmatics, and cold hands and feet.

ACE inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: any one of a group of drugs used in the treatment of raised blood pressure and heart failure. ACE inhibitors act by interfering with the action of the enzyme that converts the inactive *angiotensin I to the powerful artery constrictor angiotensin II. The absence of this substance allows arteries to widen and the blood pressure to drop. Possible side-effects include weakness, dizziness, loss of appetite, and skin rashes.

acentric n. (in genetics) a chromosome or fragment of a chromosome that has no *centromere. Since acentrics cannot attach to the *spindle they are usually lost during cell division. They are often found in cells damaged by radiation. —acentric adj.

acephalus n. a fetus without a head.

acervulus cerebri a collection of granules of calcium-containing material that is sometimes found within the *pineal gland as its calcification proceeds (normally after the 17th year): ‘brain sand’.

acesulfame potassium an artificial sweetener (E950) 200 times sweeter than sugar. It is often used in combination with other sweeteners to produce a superior flavour. Not metabolized by the body, it is suitable for use in diabetic foods and can be used in cooking.

acetabulum (cotyloid cavity) n. either of the two deep sockets, one on each side of the *hip bone, into which the head of the thigh bone (femur) fits at the *hip joint.

acetaminophen n. see paracetamol.

acetazolamide n. a *carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma to reduce the pressure inside the eyeball and also as a preventative for epileptic seizures and altitude sickness. Side-effects include drowsiness and numbness and tingling of the hands and feet.

acetoacetic acid an organic acid produced in large amounts by the liver under metabolic conditions associated with a high rate of fatty acid oxidation (for example, in starvation). The acetoacetic acid thus formed is subsequently converted to acetone and excreted. See also ketone.

acetone n. an organic compound that is an intermediate in many bacterial fermentations and is produced by fatty acid oxidation. In certain abnormal conditions (for example, starvation) acetone and other *ketones may accumulate in the blood (see ketosis). Acetone is a volatile liquid that is miscible with both fats and water and therefore of great value as a solvent. It is used in chromatography and in the preparation of tissues for enzyme extraction.

acetone body (ketone body) see ketone.

acetonuria n. see ketonuria.

acetylcholine n. the acetic acid ester of the organic base choline: the *neurotransmitter released at the synapses of parasympathetic nerves and at *neuromuscular junctions. After relaying a nerve impulse, acetylcholine is rapidly broken down by the enzyme *cholinesterase. *Antimuscarinic drugs block the action of acetylcholine at receptor sites; *anticholinesterases and *acetylcholinesterase inhibitors prolong the activity of acetylcholine by blocking cholinesterase.

A pharmaceutical preparation of acetylcholine is instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye as a *miotic during intraocular surgery.

acetylcholinesterase n. see cholinesterase.

acetylcholinesterase inhibitor any one of a class of drugs that block the action of acetylcholinesterase (see cholinesterase), an enzyme that quickly breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This neurotransmitter is central to the functional interconnection between nerve cells in the outer layer (cortex) of the brain; the early impairment of cognitive function found in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with a reduction in acetylcholine levels. By inhibiting acetylcholine breakdown, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been found helpful in slowing down the rate of cognitive decline in mild to moderate dementia; they do not halt the progress of the disease. The group includes donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine

acetylcysteine n. a drug administered to break down mucus filaments in the eyes in the treatment of dry eyes (for example, in *Sjögren’s syndrome). It is also given to prevent liver damage in paracetamol overdosage. Acetylcysteine has been shown to have efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but it is not licensed for this purpose.

acetylsalicylic acid see aspirin.

achalasia a disorder of the oesophagus (gullet) characterized by uncoordinated or absent contraction of oesophageal smooth muscle and incomplete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), leading to disturbances of swallowing (see dysphagia). It may occur at any age and affects both sexes equally: symptoms include progressive difficulty in swallowing liquids and solids, food regurgitation, and chest pain precipitated by oesophageal spasm. Diagnosis is by *barium swallow X-ray examination, endoscopy, and oesophageal *manometry. Treatment is by endoscopic balloon dilatation of the LOS, surgical division of the muscle fibres of the LOS (Heller’s cardiomyotomy), or by injection of *botulinum toxin into the LOS.

Achilles tendon the tendon of the muscles of the calf of the leg (the *gastrocnemius and soleus muscles), situated at the back of the ankle and attached to the calcaneus (heel bone).

achlorhydria n. absence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Achlorhydria is associated with many conditions, including autoimmune diseases (such as pernicious anaemia), drug therapy (particularly proton pump inhibitors), *Helicobacter pylori infection, and previous gastric surgery. It carries an increased risk of stomach cancer, bacterial overgrowth, and hip fractures.

acholia n. absence or deficiency of bile secretion or failure of the bile to enter the alimentary canal (for example, because of an obstructed bile duct).

acholuria n. absence of the *bile pigments from the urine, which occurs in some forms of jaundice (acholuric jaundice). —acholuric adj.

achondroplasia n. a disorder, inherited as a *dominant characteristic, in which the bones of the arms and legs fail to grow to normal size due to a defect in both cartilage and bone. It results in a type of *dwarfism characterized by short limbs, a normal-sized head and body, and normal intelligence. —achondroplastic adj.

achromatic adj. without colour.

achromatic lenses lenses that are specially designed to give clear images, eliminating the coloured fringes that are produced with ordinary lenses (caused by splitting of the light into different wavelengths and hence its component colours). Such lenses are useful in scientific instruments, such as the eyepieces of microscopes.

achromatopsia n. the inability to differentiate different shades of colour. Such complete *colour blindness is very rare and is usually associated with poor *visual acuity, nystagmus, and sensitivity to bright light. It is usually determined by hereditary factors.

aciclovir (acyclovir) n. an antiviral drug that inhibits DNA synthesis in cells infected by *herpesviruses. It is used in the treatment of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, herpetic eye disease, and herpes encephalitis and also in patients whose immune systems are compromised.

acidaemia n. abnormally high blood acidity. This condition may result from an increase in the concentration of acidic substances and/or a decrease in the level of alkaline substances in the blood. See also acidosis. Compare alkalaemia.

acid-base balance the balance between the amount of carbonic acid and bicarbonate in the blood, which must be maintained at a constant ratio of 1:20 in order to keep the hydrogen ion concentration of the plasma at a constant value (pH 7.4). Any alteration in this ratio will disturb the acid-base balance of the blood and tissues and cause either *acidosis or *alkalosis. The lungs and the kidneys play an important role in the regulation of the acid-base balance.

acid-etch technique a technique for creating a mechanical bond between resin-based materials and the enamel of teeth; it is used to retain and seal the margins of composite fillings, to retain brackets of fixed orthodontic appliances, and to retain resin-based *fissure sealants and adhesive bridges. Phosphoric acid is used to create a porous surface into which a bonding agent can flow.

acid-fast adj. 1. describing bacteria that have been stained and continue to hold the stain after treatment with an acidic solution. For example, tuberculosis bacteria are acid-fast when stained with a *carbol fuchsin preparation. 2. describing a stain that is not removed from a specimen by washing with an acidic solution.

acidophil (acidophilic) adj. 1. (in histology) describing tissues, cells, or parts of cells that stain with acid dyes (such as eosin). See also adenoma. 2. (in bacteriology) describing bacteria that grow well in acid media.

acidosis n. a condition in which the acidity of body fluids and tissues is abnormally high. This arises because of a failure of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining a balance between acids and alkalis in the blood (see acid-base balance). In gaseous acidosis more than the normal amount of carbon dioxide is retained in the body, as in drowning. Patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from *diabetic ketoacidosis, in which sodium, potassium, and *ketone bodies are lost in the urine. See also lactic acidosis; renal tubular acidosis.

acinus n. (pl. acini) 1. a small sac or cavity surrounded by the secretory cells of a gland. Some authorities regard the term as synonymous with *alveolus, but others distinguish an acinus by the possession of a narrow passage (lumen) leading from the sac. 2. (in the lung) the tissue supplied with air by one terminal *bronchiole. *Emphysema is classified by the part of the acinus involved (i.e. centriacinar, panacinar, or periacinar). —acinous adj.

acitretin n. see retinoid.

aclasia (aclasis) n. see exostosis.

acne (acne vulgaris) n. a common inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands. These grease-producing glands are under androgen control, but the cause of acne is unknown. It typically involves the face, back, and chest and is characterized by the presence of blackheads with papules, pustules, and – in more severe cases – cysts and scars. Acne is readily treatable. Mild cases respond to topical therapy with *benzoyl peroxide, while more refractory conditions require treatment with long-term antibiotics or (for treating women only) the oral contraceptive pill; severe or cystic acne can be treated with oral *isotretinoin. Exogenous or occupational factors, such as occlusion from tight or impermeable clothes, make-up, or chemicals, may trigger or exacerbate acne (see chloracne).

aconite n. the dried roots of the herbaceous plant Aconitum napellus (monkshood or wolfbane), containing three *analgesic substances: aconine, aconitine, and picraconitine. Aconite was formerly used to prepare liniments for muscular pains and a tincture for toothache, but is regarded as too toxic for use today.

acoria n. absence of the pupil.

acoustic adj. of or relating to sound or the sense of hearing.

acoustic incident a sudden unexpected noise, typically transmitted through a telephone handset or headset, with the potential of triggering *acoustic shock.

acoustic nerve see cochlear nerve.

It is a manifestation of *Lyme disease. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an inherited (autosomal *recessive) inability to absorb sufficient *zinc, which causes patchy sparse hair; patches of dry scaly eczematous skin on the hands, feet, scalp, and around the mouth and anogenital region; and chronic diarrhoea. Management consists of zinc supplements.

acrodynia n. see pink disease.

acromegaly n. a condition caused by excessive secretion of *growth hormone, usually by a benign tumour of the anterior pituitary gland. Overgrowth of soft tissues and bones characteristically results in large spadelike hands and feet, prominent brow ridges, broadening of the bridge of the nose, *prognathism, widely spaced teeth, enlargement of the tongue, and excessive skin tags. The condition can be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer of the large bowel. Treatment is by surgical removal of the tumour (adenomectomy) and/or radiotherapy, with or without hormone therapy.

It breaks down just before fertilization (the acrosome reaction), releasing a number of enzymes that assist penetration between the follicle cells that still surround the ovum. Failure of the acrosome reaction is a cause of male infertility (see also andrology).

acrylic resin a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymeric material derived from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or other related compounds. Acrylic resins are used in dentistry for making denture teeth, denture bases, and orthodontic appliances owing to their good biocompatibility. They are also used in orthopaedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, and ophthalmology for the same reason.

ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, adrenocorticotrophin, corticotrophin) a hormone synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, large amounts of which are released in response to any form of stress. Its release is stimulated by *corticotrophin-releasing hormone. ACTH controls the secretion of *corticosteroid hormones from the adrenal gland. An analogue of ACTH, tetracosactide, is administered by injection to test adrenal function (see Synacthen tests).

actin n. a protein, found in muscle, that plays an important role in the process of contraction. See striated muscle.

It is caused by the genus Actinomyces, with Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae being responsible for the majority of infections. The bacterium is normally present in the mouth but it may become pathogenic following a dental infection, radiation therapy, or trauma causing local tissue damage (including a dental extraction). It can also affect the lungs, breast, or gastrointestinal tract. Treatment is by surgical drainage of pus and a prolonged course of antibiotics. *Hyperbaric oxygenation may also be used.

actinotherapy n. the treatment of disorders with *infrared or *ultraviolet radiation.

action potential the change in voltage that occurs across the membrane of a nerve or muscle cell when a *nerve impulse is triggered. It is due to the passage of charged particles across the membrane (see depolarization) and is an observable manifestation of the passage of an impulse.

active/passive adj. the ethical distinction between actively doing something to a patient and simply allowing it to happen or failing to act (the acts and omissions doctrine). For instance, doctors should act to save life if possible, but when death is inevitable it is permissible to let it happen, although the prohibition against killing would not allow active intervention. See also dying.

active transport (in biochemistry) an energy-dependent process in which certain substances (including ions, some drugs, and amino acids) are able to cross cell membranes against a concentration gradient. The process is inhibited by substances that interfere with cellular metabolism (e.g. high doses of digitalis).

activin n. a protein complex that enhances the biosynthesis and secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone and helps to regulate the menstrual cycle. Inhibin is closely related and exerts an opposite effect: it down-regulates FSH synthesis and inhibits FSH secretion.

activities of daily living (ADLs) the tasks of everyday life. Basic ADLs include self-care tasks, such as bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, toileting, and moving. Instrumental ADLs include housework, shopping, managing finances, taking medication, and cooking. Inability to perform ADLs is a practical measure of disability in many disorders; problems are much more prevalent in the elderly.

actomyosin n. a protein complex formed in muscle between actin and myosin during the process of contraction. See striated muscle.

acuity n. see visual acuity.

acupuncture n. a complementary therapy in which fine sterile needles are inserted into the skin at specific points on the body. It was developed by Eastern physicians, who recognize pathways (meridians) and flows of energy (called qi) within the body. It may work by allowing the body to release its own natural painkillers (*endorphins). Acupuncture is used to relieve the symptoms of many physical and psychological conditions, including chronic pain.

acute adj. 1. describing a disease of rapid onset, severe symptoms, and brief duration. Compare chronic. 2. describing any intense symptom, such as severe pain.

acute abdomen the sudden uncontrolled development of severe abdominal symptoms secondary to disease or injury. Failure to establish a prompt diagnosis may lead to rapid clinical decline. Perforation of a peptic ulcer, an inflamed appendix or colonic diverticulum, or rupture of the liver or spleen following a crush injury all produce an acute abdomen requiring urgent treatment.

acute coronary syndrome a combination of angina (unstable or stable), non-S–T elevation *myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and S–T elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It implies the presence of coronary artery disease.

acute fatty liver of pregnancy a rare and life-threatening complication of pregnancy that usually presents in the third trimester with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, malaise, and abdominal pain. Liver function tests are abnormal and the features of *pre-eclampsia and often *HELLP syndrome are present. *Hepatic encephalopathy, *disseminated intravascular coagulation, and renal failure may develop, and the condition is associated with a high maternal and fetal mortality. Treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach, usually in an intensive care unit.

acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (toxic pustuloderma) a reaction to a medication, resulting in the appearance of fine sterile *pustules on inflamed skin; the pustules may easily be overlooked. Common causes include penicillins, and pustular psoriasis must be excluded from the diagnosis.

acute kidney injury see AKI.

acute renal failure acute kidney injury (see AKI).

acute respiratory distress syndrome see adult respiratory distress syndrome.

acute respiratory failure (ARF) a primary disorder of gaseous exchange (as distinct from failure of the mechanical process of breathing).

acute retinal necrosis (ARN) severe inflammation and necrosis of the retina associated with inflammation and blockage of retinal blood vessels, haemorrhage and death of retinal tissue, and retinal detachment. It may affect both eyes (bilateral acute retinal necrosis, BARN), and visual prognosis is poor. ARN is thought to be due to viral infection.

acute rheumatism see rheumatic fever.

acute tubular necrosis (ATN) a condition caused by acute renal injury from either ischaemia or toxins and associated with tubular damage that is usually reversible. The earliest feature is *isosthenuria, which may occur while there is still a high urine flow rate. This is followed by a reduction in *glomerular filtration rate. *Oliguria is common and dialysis often needed for survival. If the cause of the initial damage can be removed, recovery of renal function within six weeks can be expected in most cases.

acyclovir n. see aciclovir.

ad- prefix denoting towards or near. Examples: adaxial (towards the main axis); adoral (towards or near the mouth).

ADA deficiency see adenosine deaminase deficiency.

adalimumab n. a *cytokine inhibitor used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. It can predispose to infections, and patients should be carefully monitored.

Adams–Stokes syndrome see Stokes–Adams syndrome.

ADAMTS13 adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with athrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13, also known as von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease: an enzyme that cleaves and degrades large von Willebrand factor multimers and decreases their activity, thereby disrupting *platelet activation. Most cases of *thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are as a result of inhibition or deficiency of ADAMTS13.

adaptation n. 1. the phenomenon in which a sense organ shows a gradually diminishing response to continuous or repetitive stimulation. The nose, for example, may become adapted to the stimulus of an odour that is continuously present so that in time it ceases to report its presence. Similarly, the adaptation of touch receptors in the skin means that the presence of clothes can be forgotten a few minutes after they have been put on. 2. a process of change to enable adjustment to a condition or environment.

addiction n. a state of *dependence produced either by the habitual taking of drugs or by regularly engaging in certain activities (e.g. gambling). People can develop physical and psychological symptoms of *dependence, which include a strong desire to take the substance or exercise the behaviour, impaired capacity to control such behaviour or substance taking, a physical or psychological *withdrawal state, evidence of *tolerance development, social and mental preoccupation with substance use or the given behaviour, and persistent use despite harmful consequences. Treatment is directed to withdrawal of the drug or behaviour with the aim of partial or total abstinence. See also alcoholism; tolerance.

Addisonian crisis an acute medical emergency due to a lack of corticosteroid production by the body, caused by disease of the adrenal glands or long-term suppression of production by steroid medication. It manifests as low blood pressure and collapse, biochemical abnormalities, hypoglycaemia, and (if untreated) coma and death. Treatment is with steroids, administered initially intravenously in high doses and later orally. In patients with poor adrenal function an Addisonian crisis is usually brought on by an acute illness, such as an infection. [T. Addison (1793–1860), British physician]

Addison’s disease a syndrome resulting from inadequate secretion of corticosteroid hormones due to the progressive destruction of the adrenal cortex. It is characterized by progressive deterioration with hypotension and collapse due to severe dehydration, salt loss, and *hypoglycaemia; dark pigmentation of the skin may occur. Formerly tuberculosis was a common cause, but the condition is now more likely to be due to autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortices (see autoimmune disease). Treatment is with *hydrocortisone and *fludrocortisone. [T. Addison]

adenine n. one of the nitrogen-containing bases (see purine) that occurs in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA. See also ATP.

adenitis n. inflammation of a gland or group of glands (or glandlike structures). For example, mesenteric adenitis affects the lymph nodes (formerly called lymph glands) in the membranous support of the intestines (the mesentery). Causing abdominal pain, usually in children, it is a common, usually mild and self-limiting, condition. Cervical adenitis affects the lymph nodes in the neck.

adenocarcinoma n. a malignant epithelial tumour arising from glandular structures, which are constituent parts of most organs of the body. The term is also applied to tumours showing a glandular growth pattern. These tumours may be subclassified according to the substances that they produce, for example mucinous and serous adenocarcinomas, or to the microscopic arrangement of their cells into patterns, for example papillary and follicular adenocarcinomas (see also clear-cell carcinoma). They may be solid or cystic (cystadenocarcinomas).

adenohypophysis n. the anterior lobe of the *pituitary gland.

adenoidectomy n. surgical removal of the *adenoids in patients who suffer from either *glue ear or difficulty in breathing through the nose.

adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsil) n. a collection of lymphatic tissue in the *nasopharynx. Enlargement of the adenoids can cause obstruction to breathing through the nose and can block the *Eustachian tubes, causing *glue ear.

adenolymphoma n. see Warthin’s tumour.

adenoma n. a benign tumour of epithelial origin that is derived from glandular tissue or exhibits clearly defined glandular structures. Adenomas may undergo malignant change (see adenocarcinoma). Some show recognizable tissue elements, such as fibrous tissue (fibroadenomas), while others, such as some bronchial adenomas, may produce active compounds giving rise to clinical syndromes (see carcinoid). Tumours in certain organs, including the pituitary gland, are often classified by their histological staining affinities, for example eosinophil, basophil, and chromophobe adenomas.

adenoma sebaceum a condition in which angiofibromas (flesh-coloured or pink papules) are often seen around the nose and cheek or elsewhere on the face. They are a cutaneous sign of *tuberous sclerosis.

adenomyosis n. see endometriosis.

adenosine n. a *nucleoside that contains adenine and the sugar ribose and occurs in *ATP. It is also used as an *anti-arrhythmic drug to stop *supraventricular tachycardias and restore a normal heart rhythm. As such, it needs to be injected or infused quickly, which may fleetingly make the patient feel faint and develop chest pain.

adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency) a genetic disorder affecting about one baby in 25,000 and characterized by a defect in adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme that is involved in purine metabolism. Deficiency of this enzyme results in selective damage to the antibody-producing lymphocytes; this in turn leads to a condition known as *severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), in which the affected baby has no resistance to infection and must be entirely isolated from birth. Such children have only about a 50% chance of surviving for six months. See also gene therapy.

adenosine diphosphate see ADP.

adenosine monophosphate see AMP.

adenosine triphosphate see ATP.

adenosis n. (pl. adenoses) 1. excessive growth or development of glands. 2. any disease of a gland or glandlike structure, especially of a lymph node.

adenovirus n. one of a group of DNA-containing viruses causing infections of the upper respiratory tract that produce symptoms resembling those of the common cold.

ADEPT n. antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy: a method under development for the treatment of cancer. It involves the patient being injected first with an antibody-enzyme complex that binds specifically to tumour cells, and later with a *prodrug that is inactive until it comes into contact with the antibody-enzyme complex. The enzyme converts the prodrug into a cytotoxic form, which is concentrated around the tumour and can therefore destroy the cancer cells without damaging normal tissue.

ADH antidiuretic hormone (see vasopressin).

ADHD see attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

adherence n. the degree to which a patient follows medical advice. Medicines adherence refers specifically to taking medication (drug compliance) but adherence may also be applied to physiotherapy exercises or attending appointments for courses of therapy. Nonadherence falls into two broad categories: intentional nonadherence involves the patient making a decision not to follow medical advice; in unintentional nonadherence the patient forgets or misunderstands the advice.

adhesion n. 1. a fibrous band of connective tissue that develops in response to inflammation, trauma, or surgery, resulting in the union of two adjacent structures. Adhesions between loops of intestine often occur following abdominal surgery and may predispose to symptoms of abdominal pain or intestinal obstruction. If the pericardial sac is affected by an adhesion, the contractions of the heart may be restricted. 2. a healing process in which the edges of a wound fit together. In primary adhesion there is very little *granulation tissue; in secondary adhesion the two edges are joined together by granulation tissue.

adhesion molecules *cell-surface molecules that are important for binding cells to neighbouring cells (intercellular adhesion molecules, ICAM) and tissues. Absence or weakening of intercellular binding facilitates the local spread of cancer.

adhesive capsulitis see frozen shoulder.

Adie’s pupil see tonic pupil. [W. J. Adie (1886–1935), British physician]

Adie’s syndrome (Holmes-Adie syndrome) an abnormality of the pupils of the eyes, often affecting only one eye. The affected pupil is dilated and reacts slowly to light; the response on convergence *accommodation of the eyes is also slow (see tonic pupil). Tendon reflexes may be absent. The condition is almost entirely restricted to women. [W. J. Adie; Sir G. M. Holmes (1876–1965), British neurologist]

adipocere n. a waxlike substance, consisting mainly of fatty acids, into which the soft tissues of the body can be converted after death. This usually occurs when the body is buried in damp earth or is submerged in water. Adipocere delays post-mortem decomposition and is a spontaneous form of preservation without mummification.

adipocyte n. see adipose tissue.

adipose tissue fibrous *connective tissue packed with masses of fat cells (adipocytes). In human adults it consists mostly of white fat (see also brown fat). It forms a thick layer under the skin and occurs around the kidneys and in the buttocks. It serves both as an insulating layer and an energy store; food in excess of requirements is converted into fats and stored within these cells.

adiposis (liposis) n. the presence of abnormally large accumulations of fat in the body. The condition may arise from overeating, hormone irregularities, or a metabolic disorder. In adiposis dolorosa, a condition affecting women more commonly than men, painful fatty swellings are associated with defects in the nervous system. See also obesity.

adipsia n. see hypodipsia.

aditus n. an anatomical opening or passage; for example, the opening of the tympanic cavity (middle ear) to the air spaces of the mastoid process.

adjunct n. a subsidiary drug used in treating a disorder, which provides additional benefits to the main drug used in treatment. For example, the *dopamine receptor agonist cabergoline is used as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. —adjunctive adj.

adjuvant n. any substance used in conjunction with another to enhance its activity. Aluminium salts are used as adjuvants in the preparation of vaccines from the toxins of diphtheria and tetanus: by keeping the toxins in precipitated form, the salts increase the efficacy of the toxins as antigens.

adjuvant therapy treatment given to patients after the primary therapy, which is usually surgical removal of the tumour, when there is a high risk of future recurrence based on tumour stage and histology. Adjuvant therapy is aimed at destroying these microscopic tumour cells either locally (e.g. adjuvant breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery) or systemically (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended for patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer). Compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

ADLs see activities of daily living.

admission rate the number of people from a specified population with a specified disease or condition admitted to hospitals in a given geographical area over a specified time period.

adnexa pl. n. adjoining parts. For example, the uterine adnexa are the Fallopian tubes and ovaries (which adjoin the uterus).

adolescence n. the stage of development between childhood and adulthood. It begins with the start of *puberty, which in girls is usually at the age of 12–13 years and in boys about 14 years, and usually lasts until 19 years of age. All adolescents must learn gradually to exercise their own *autonomy, whether they have legal *capacity or not. Clinicians may not know who has the *responsibility to take decisions without careful thought and discussion (see also Gillick competence).

ADP (adenosine diphosphate) a compound containing adenine, ribose, and two phosphate groups. ADP occurs in cells and is involved in processes requiring the transfer of energy (see ATP).

adrenalectomy n. the surgical removal of an *adrenal gland, usually performed because of neoplastic disease.

adrenal glands (suprarenal glands) two triangular *endocrine glands, each of which covers the superior surface of a kidney. Each gland has two parts, the medulla and cortex. The medulla forms the grey core of the gland; it consists mainly of *chromaffin tissue and is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to produce *adrenaline and *noradrenaline. The cortex is a yellowish tissue surrounding the medulla. It is derived embryologically from mesoderm and is stimulated by pituitary hormones (principally *ACTH) to produce three kinds of *corticosteroid hormones, which affect carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. *cortisol), electrolyte metabolism (e.g. *aldosterone), and the sex glands (oestrogens and androgens).

adrenaline (epinephrine) n. an important hormone secreted by the medulla of the adrenal gland. It has the function of preparing the body for ‘fright, flight, or fight’ and has widespread effects on circulation, the muscles, and sugar metabolism. The action of the heart is increased, the rate and depth of breathing are increased, and the metabolic rate is raised; the force of muscular contraction improves and the onset of muscular fatigue is delayed. At the same time the blood supply to the bladder and intestines is reduced, their muscular walls relax, and the sphincters contract. Sympathetic nerves were originally thought to act by releasing adrenaline at their endings, and were therefore called adrenergic nerves. In fact the main substance released is the related substance *noradrenaline, which also forms a portion of the adrenal secretion.

Adrenaline given by injection is used in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. It is also included in some local anaesthetic solutions, particularly those used in dentistry, to prolong anaesthesia, and is used as eye drops for treating glaucoma.

adrenarche n. the start of secretion of *androgens by the adrenal glands, occurring at around 6–7 years of age in girls and 7–8 in boys. It is usually determined by the measurement of urinary 17-ketosteroids rather than direct assay of the androgens themselves. Adrenal androgens are *dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulphate, and androstenedione. The age of adrenarche is unrelated to the age of *gonadarche. Premature adrenarche is usually manifested as the early appearance of pubic hair due to levels of the adrenal androgens equivalent to those found in puberty. It does not proceed to full puberty as the gonads do not become active.

adrenergic adj. 1. describing nerve fibres that release noradrenaline or adrenaline as a neurotransmitter. 2. describing receptors that are stimulated by noradrenaline or adrenaline. See adrenoceptor.

adrenoceptor (adrenoreceptor, adrenergic receptor) any cell *receptor that binds with the catecholamines adrenaline or noradrenaline, the neurotransmitters of the *sympathetic nervous system. There are two principal types of adrenoceptor, alpha (α) and beta (β), with various subtypes of each. Alpha adrenoceptors have a slightly higher affinity for adrenaline than for noradrenaline; they can be divided into subtypes α1 and α2. α1-adrenoceptors mediate contraction of smooth muscle; in the walls of arteries, for example, their stimulation causes constriction of arteries and a rise in blood pressure. α2-adrenoceptors occur in the presynaptic membranes of neurons in the sympathetic nervous system, where they restrict the release of catecholamines from these neurons. Beta adrenoceptors also have two subtypes. β1-adrenoceptors have an equal affinity for adrenaline and noradrenaline and are found mainly in cardiac muscle; their stimulation causes an increase in heart rate. β2-adrenoceptors have a slightly higher affinity for adrenaline. They mediate relaxation of smooth muscle in the blood vessels, bronchi, bladder, uterus, and other organs and thus cause widening of the airways and *vasodilatation.

Drugs that stimulate these receptors (alpha agonists and beta agonists) are described as *sympathomimetic. Drugs that block their effects are the *alpha blockers and *beta blockers.

adrenocorticotrophic hormone (adrenocorticotrophin) see ACTH.

adrenogenital syndrome a hormonal disorder resulting from abnormal steroid production by the adrenal cortex, due to a genetic fault. It may cause masculinization in girls, precocious puberty in boys, and adrenocortical failure (see Addison’s disease) in both sexes. Treatment is by lifelong steroid replacement.

adrenoleukodystrophy n. a genetically determined condition of neurological degeneration with childhood and adult forms. Inherited as an X-linked (see sex-linked) trait resulting in *demyelination, it is characterized by progressive *spastic paralysis of the legs, sensory loss, and cognitive impairment, associated with adrenal gland insufficiency and small gonads. The demonstration of a genetic defect in the metabolism of very long chain fatty acids aids diagnosis and has implications for future possible drug therapies. Prenatal diagnosis is possible.

adrenolytic adj. inhibiting the activity of *adrenergic nerves. Adrenolytic activity is opposite to that of *noradrenaline.

adult respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) a form of *acute respiratory failure that occurs after a precipitating event, such as trauma, aspiration, or inhalation of a toxic substance; it is particularly associated with septic shock. Lung injury is characterized by reduced oxygen in the arteries, reduced lung volume, and decreased lung compliance, and diffuse infiltrates are seen on a chest X-ray. Treatment is correction of the original cause, volume replacement, diuretics, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation.

advanced glycation end-products damaged proteins that result from the *glycation of a large number of body proteins, which can accumulate and cause permanent damage to tissues. This damage is more prevalent in diabetics due to chronic exposure to blood with high concentrations of glucose. It is believed to be partly responsible for the damage to the kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels that characterizes long-standing diabetes.

advance directive, decision, or statement (in England and Wales under the Mental Capacity Act 2005) a legally recognized decision or statement by an adult with *capacity identifying any specific or general treatment the patient does not want in the event that he or she loses capacity. An advance directive or decision (formerly often called a living will) should be informed, made voluntarily, and must be valid and applicable to the medical situation that arises; at the extreme it can constitute an advance refusal of potentially life-saving treatment. It cannot, however, be used to demand future treatment and does not apply as long as the person retains capacity. An advance statement is a more general and less legally binding expression of the person’s values and views on the sort of treatment he or she may or may not wish to undergo. Directives and statements can raise ethical questions: for example, should life-saving treatment refused in advance nevertheless be given if it could restore the patient to a quality of life with which he or she was content before losing capacity.

advanced life support (ALS) a structured and algorithm-driven method of life support for use in the severest of medical emergencies, especially cardiac arrest. Doctors, nurses, and paramedic personnel involved in ALS receive special training in the use of equipment (e.g. defibrillators and appropriate drugs). Paediatric advanced life support (PALS) is ALS for use in severe medical emergencies in children, while advanced trauma life support(ATLS) is specifically for patients who have been subjected to major trauma, such as a serious road accident. Compare basic life support.

advancement n. the detachment by surgery of a muscle, musculocutaneous flap, or tendon from its normal attachment site and its reattachment at a more advanced (anterior) point while preserving its previous nerve and blood supply. The technique is used, for example, in the treatment of squint and extensively in plastic surgery to cover large defects (see also pedicle).

adventitia (tunica adventitia) n. 1. the outer coat of the wall of a *vein or *artery. It consists of loose connective tissue and networks of small blood vessels, which nourish the walls. 2. the outer covering of various other organs or parts.

adventitious adj. 1. occurring in a place other than the usual one. 2. relating to the adventitia.

advocacy n. a role that involves acting as a proxy or speaking on behalf of a patient because the patient lacks *capacity. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, capacitous adults may legally nominate a proxy or an advocate to make health-care decisions on their behalf in the event of losing capacity. For patients without family or legally appointed advocates, the *Independent Mental Capacity Advocate should be contacted when making significant medical decisions. Health-care professionals may see their role as including advocacy for patients, e.g. in accessing services. In addition, there are many organized advocacy groups to support patients with specific conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, every NHS trust has a *Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), which can take on the role of supporting patients. See also proxy decision; substituted judgment.

AECOPD acute exacerbation of COPD (see chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

AED see automated external defibrillator.

Aëdes n. a genus of widely distributed mosquitoes occurring throughout the tropics and subtropics. Most species are black with distinct white or silvery-yellow markings on the legs and thorax. Aëdes species are not only important as vectors of *dengue, *yellow fever, *filariasis, and Group B viruses causing encephalitis but also constitute a serious biting nuisance. A. aegypti is the principal vector of dengue and yellow fever.

aegophony n. see vocal resonance.

aetiology (etiology) n. 1. the study or science of the causes of disease. 2. the cause of a specific disease.

afebrile adj. without, or not showing any signs of, a fever.

affect n. (in psychiatry) 1. the predominant emotion in a person’s mental state at a particular moment. Blunted affect is a diminished intensity of emotional response; it is a feature of some forms of chronic *schizophrenia. Flat affect is an inability to respond emotionally despite the presence of emotions. It is commonly seen in depression. Incongruent affect describes an inappropriate emotional response to a situation (e.g. laughing at a funeral) and may be seen in psychotic illnesses. 2. the emotion associated with a particular idea. —affective adj.

affective disorder (mood disorder) any psychiatric disorder featuring abnormalities of mood or emotion (*affect). The most serious of these are *depression and *mania. Other affective disorders include *SAD (seasonal affective disorder).

Affordable Care Act 2010 (ACA) US federal legislation that introduced the most sweeping reforms to the US health-care system since the launch of *Medicaid and *Medicare in 1965. Under the Act private insurers are placed under an obligation to accept all applicants; to charge the same premiums to all applicants of the same age, regardless of pre-existing conditions; and to provide certain ‘essential health benefits’ under every policy. A further provision, mandating all adults not otherwise covered to take out a private policy, was repealed in 2019. The Act also expanded eligibility to Medicaid, took steps to constrain the costs of Medicare, and encouraged more employers to provide schemes to their employees; there were also reforms to health-care delivery. Known in full as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the legislation is often referred to colloquially as Obamacare, after President Barack Obama, who introduced it.

afibrinogenaemia n. complete absence of the coagulation factor *fibrinogen in the blood. Compare hypofibrinogenaemia.

aflatoxin n. a poisonous substance produced in the spores of the fungus Aspergillus flavus, which infects peanuts. The toxin is known to produce cancer in certain animals and is suspected of being the cause of liver cancers in human beings living in warm and humid regions of the world, where stored nuts and cereals may be contaminated by the fungus.

aflibercept n. a drug that inhibits the action of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and thereby prevents the development of new blood vessels (see angiogenesis inhibitor). It is injected into the vitreous humour to stop abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) in treating wet age-related *macular degeneration and is given by intravenous infusion, in combination with chemotherapy drugs, to treat metastatic colorectal cancer.

AFP see alpha-fetoprotein.

afterbirth n. the placenta, umbilical cord, and ruptured membranes associated with the fetus, which normally become detached from the uterus and expelled within a few hours of birth.

aftercare n. long-term surveillance or rehabilitation as an adjunct or supplement to formal medical treatment of those who are chronically sick or disabled, including those with mental illness or learning disability. Aftercare includes the provision of equipment and the adaptation of homes to aid *activities of daily living.

after-image n. an impression of an image that is registered by the brain for a brief moment after an object is removed from in front of the eye, or after the eye is closed. A positive afterimage, which lasts a few seconds, retains the colour and brightness of the original image; the more common negative afterimage lasts longer and has colours and brightness that are complementary to the original.

afterpains pl. n. pains caused by uterine contractions after childbirth, especially during breast feeding, due to release of the hormone *oxytocin. The contractions help restore the uterus to its nonpregnant size and are more common in women who have given birth twice or more.

agammaglobulinaemia n. a total deficiency of the plasma protein *gammaglobulin. Compare hypogammaglobulinaemia.

agar n. an extract of certain seaweeds that forms a gel suitable for the solidification of liquid bacteriological *culture media. Blood agar is nutrient agar containing 5–10% horse blood, used for the cultivation of certain bacteria or for detecting haemolytic (blood-destroying) activity.

agenesis n. absence of an organ, usually due to total failure of its development in the embryo. Dental agenesis (also known as *hypodontia) is the most common developmental anomaly in humans and may be caused by genetic defects in codes for transcription factors, proteins, and fibroblast growth factors.

age-related macular degeneration (AMD, ARMD) see macular degeneration.

Age UK the UK’s largest charity for older people, formed in 2009 from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. Related charities exist for the UK’s devolved nations: Age Scotland, Age Cymru, and Age NI.

agglutination (clumping) n. the sticking together, by serum antibodies called agglutinins, of such microscopic antigenic particles as red blood cells or bacteria so that they form visible clumps. Any substance that stimulates the body to produce an agglutinin is called an agglutinogen. Agglutination is a specific reaction; in the laboratory, sera containing different known agglutinins provide an invaluable means of identifying unknown bacteria. When blood of different groups is mixed, agglutination occurs because serum contains natural antibodies (isoagglutinins) that attack red cells of a foreign group, whether previously encountered or not. This is not the same process as occurs in *blood coagulation.

agglutinin n. an antibody that brings about the *agglutination of bacteria, blood cells, or other antigenic particles.

agglutinogen n. any antigen that provokes formation of an agglutinin in the serum and is therefore likely to be involved in *agglutination.

aglossia n. congenital absence of the tongue.

agnathia n. congenital absence of the lower jaw, either partial or complete.

agnosia n. a disorder of the brain whereby the patient cannot interpret sensations correctly although the sense organs and nerves conducting sensation to the brain are functioning normally. It is due to a disorder of the *association areas in the parietal lobes. In auditory agnosia the patient can hear but cannot interpret sounds (including speech). A patient with tactile agnosia (astereognosis) retains normal sensation in his hands but cannot recognize three-dimensional objects by touch alone. In visual agnosia the patient can see but cannot interpret symbols, including letters (see alexia).

agonal adj. describing or relating to the phenomena, such as cessation of breathing or change in the ECG or EEG, that are associated with the moment of death. For example, an agonal rhythm describes the ECG of a dying patient, characterized by slow, irregular, and wide ventricular complexes that eventually stop (see electrocardiogram). It is often seen in the terminal stages of a failed attempt at cardiac resuscitation.

agonist n. 1. (prime mover) a muscle whose active contraction causes movement of a part of the body. Contraction of an agonist is associated with relaxation of its *antagonist. 2. a drug or other substance that acts at a cell-receptor site to produce an effect that is the same as, or similar to, that of the body’s normal chemical messenger. *Sympathomimetic drugs (alpha agonists and beta agonists) are examples.

agoraphobia n. a morbid fear of public places and/or of open spaces. Compare claustrophobia. See also phobia.

agranulocytosis n. a disorder in which there is a severe acute deficiency of certain blood cells (*neutrophils) as a result of damage to the bone marrow by toxic drugs or chemicals. It is characterized by fever, with ulceration of the mouth and throat, and may lead rapidly to prostration and death. Treatment is by the administration of antibiotics in large quantities. When feasible, transfusion of white blood cells may be life-saving.

agraphia (dysgraphia) n. an acquired inability to write, although the strength and coordination of the hand remain normal. It is related to the disorders of language and it is caused by disease in the dominant *parietal lobe of the brain. See Gerstmann’s syndrome.

ague n. see malaria.

Ahmed valve a *shunt used in the treatment of *glaucoma to reduce and control intraocular pressure. The device works by bypassing the *trabecular meshwork and redirecting the outflow of aqueous humour through a small tube into an outlet chamber.

AHSN see academic health science network.

Aicardi syndrome a syndrome caused by abnormal development of the brain in which the two halves of the brain do not connect. The *corpus callosum is absent. Affected individuals suffer from learning disability and seizures. They may also have associated abnormalities of the eyes and spine. [J. D. Aicardi (20th century), French neurologist]

AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) a syndrome first identified in Los Angeles in 1981; a description of the causative virus – the human immunodeficiency virus (*HIV) – was available in 1983. The virus destroys a subgroup of lymphocytes, the *helper T cells (or *CD4 lymphocytes), resulting in suppression of the body’s immune response (see immunity). Acute (primary) infection following exposure to the virus results in the production of antibodies (seroconversion); their presence, detected by standard tests, indicates that infection has taken place. Primary infection may be accompanied by mild or severe symptoms, lasting an average of 14 days, including fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, headache, and rash. Chronic HIV infection, which follows primary infection, lasts an average of 10 years, during which the person may be asymptomatic; it is followed by the development of AIDS. AIDS can be defined by a CD4 level less than 200 cells/μ or by the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, such as *Kaposi’s sarcoma, recurrent pneumonia (especially caused by *Pneumocystis jiroveci), any of various lymphomas, or any of certain cytomegalovirus-related diseases.

AIDS is largely a sexually transmitted disease, either homosexually or heterosexually. The two other main routes of spread are via infected blood or blood products (as by drug users sharing contaminated needles) and by the maternofetal route. The virus may be transmitted from an infected mother to the child in the uterus or it may be acquired from maternal blood during parturition; it may also be transmitted in breast milk. HIV has been isolated from semen, cervical secretions, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, tears, saliva, urine, and breast milk but the concentration shows wide variations. Moreover HIV is a fragile virus and does not survive well outside the body. It is therefore considered that ordinary social contact with HIV-positive subjects involves no risk of infection. However, high standards of clinical practice are required by all health workers in order to avoid inadvertent infection via blood, blood products, or body fluids from HIV-positive people. Staff who become HIV-positive are expected to declare their status and will be counselled.

Until recently, AIDS was considered to be universally fatal, although the type and length of illness preceding death varies considerably. However, with the development of *antiretroviral drugs used in dual or triple combinations, AIDS is now perceived as a chronic disease rather than a fatal one.

AIH see artificial insemination.

ainhum n. loss of one or more toes due to slow growth of a fibrous band around the toe that eventually causes a spontaneous amputation. The condition is rare, found mainly in Africa and associated with going barefoot.

air bed a bed with a mattress whose upper surface is perforated with thousands of holes, through which air is forced under pressure. The patient is thus supported, like a hovercraft, on a cushion of air. This type of bed is invaluable for the treatment of patients with large areas of burns.

air embolism an air bubble that suddenly obstructs blood flow down a blood vessel. Air may gain access to the circulation as a result of surgery, injury, intravenous infusions, or intravascular catheters.

air sickness see motion sickness.

airway n. 1. any of the passages of the respiratory system. 2. any device that enables the flow of air into and out of the lungs. See nasopharyngeal airway; oropharyngeal airway.

airway obstruction blockage of any of the passages by which air enters (and leaves) the lungs, which may be partial or complete. In partial obstruction, the patient can still move some air in and out of the lungs but often with difficulty. There may be a distinctive sound (see stridor) on inspiration through a partly obstructed airway. Complete obstruction will rapidly lead to respiratory and then cardiac arrest and requires prompt airway clearance and support.

akathisia n. a pattern of involuntary movements induced by medication, for example *antipsychotic drugs or (more rarely) antidepressants. An affected person is driven to restless overactivity, which can be confused with the agitation for which the drug was originally prescribed. Akathisia is mostly felt as restless legs (see restless legs syndrome) rather than generalized agitation or anxiety. Antipsychotics are the main cause of akathisia but the severity depends on their affinity to *dopamine receptors. In a recent systematic review haloperidol, zotepine, and chlorpromazine were most likely to cause akathisia, with olanzapine least likely, and clozapine causing no akathisia at all. See also extrapyramidal effects.

AKI acute kidney injury, also called acute renal failure. Dehydration often leads to AKI. The diagnosis is usually based on changes in the serum creatinine concentration or the detection of *oliguria, neither of which is ideal as they tend to lag behind the phase of acute injury.

akinesia n. a loss of normal muscular tonicity or responsiveness. Akinetic rigid syndrome is used to describe such conditions as *parkinsonism and *progressive supranuclear palsy. In akinetic epilepsy there is a sudden loss of muscular tonicity, making the patient fall with momentary loss of consciousness. Akinetic mutism is a state of complete physical unresponsiveness although the patient’s eyes remain open and appear to follow movements. It is a consequence of damage to the *brainstem area of the brain. —akinetic adj.

ala n. (pl. alae) (in anatomy) a winglike structure; for example, either of the two lateral flared portions of the external nose or the winglike expansion of the ilium.

alactasia n. absence or deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is essential for the digestion of milk sugar (lactose). All babies have lactase in their intestines, but the enzyme disappears during childhood in about 10% of northern Europeans, 40% of Greeks and Italians, and 80% of Africans and Asians. Alactasia causes symptoms only if the diet regularly includes raw milk, when the undigested lactose causes diarrhoea and abdominal pain.

Alagille syndrome (arteriohepatic dysplasia) an inherited condition in which the bile ducts, which drain the liver, become progressively smaller, causing increased *jaundice. It is associated with abnormalities of other organs, such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and spine. [D. Alagille (1925–2005), French physician]

alanine n. see amino acid.

alanine aminotransferase (ALT) an enzyme involved in the transamination of amino acids. Measurement of ALT in the serum is of use in the diagnosis and study of acute liver disease. It was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).

Albers-Schönberg disease see osteopetrosis. [H. E. Albers-Schönberg (1865–1921), German radiologist]

Alberti regime (GIK regime) a method for controlling blood-sugar levels in diabetic patients who are being fasted for whatever reason. It involves infusing a solution of glucose (G), insulin (I), and potassium (K) chloride intravenously over a standard time period. Blood sugar and potassium are measured frequently so that appropriate adjustments can be made to the mixture as necessary. [K. G. M. M. Alberti (1937– ), British physician]

albinism n. the inherited absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, resulting in white hair and pink skin and eyes. The pink colour is produced by blood in underlying blood vessels, which are normally masked by pigment. Ocular signs are reduced visual acuity, sensitivity to light (see photophobia), and involuntary side-to-side eye movements.

albino n. an individual lacking the normal body pigment (melanin). See albinism.

Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy the skeletal abnormalities, collectively, of *pseudohypoparathyroidism. These include short stature, abnormally short fingers and toes (particularly involving the fourth and fifth metacarpals and metatarsals), and soft-tissue calcification. [F. Albright (1900–69), US physician]

albumin n. a protein that is soluble in water and coagulated by heat. An example is serum albumin, which is found in blood plasma and is important for the maintenance of plasma volume. Albumin is synthesized in the liver; the inability to synthesize it is a prominent feature of chronic liver disease (*cirrhosis).

albuminuria (proteinuria) n. the presence of serum albumin, serum globulin, or other serum proteins in the urine. This may be associated with kidney or heart disease. Albuminuria is not always associated with disease: it may occur after strenuous exercise or after a long period of standing (orthostatic albuminuria).

albumose n. a substance, intermediate between albumin and peptones, produced during the digestion of proteins by pepsin and other endopeptidases (see peptidase).

alcaptonuria (alkaptonuria) n. the congenital absence of an enzyme, homogentisic acid oxidase, that is essential for the normal breakdown of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. Accumulation of *homogentisic acid causes dark brown discoloration of the skin and eyes (ochronosis) and progressive damage to the joints, especially of the spine. The gene responsible for the condition is recessive, so that a child is affected only if both parents are carriers of the defective gene.

alclometazone n. a *corticosteroid drug applied as a cream to treat inflammatory skin disorders. Possible side-effects include skin thinning and allergic reactions.

alcohol n. any of a class of organic compounds formed when a hydroxyl group (–OH) is substituted for a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon. The alcohol in alcoholic drinks is ethyl alcohol (ethanol), which has the formula C2H5OH. It is produced by the fermentation of sugar by yeast. ‘Pure’ alcohol contains not less than 94.9% by volume of ethyl alcohol. It is obtained by distillation. A solution of 70% alcohol can be used as a preservative or antiseptic. When taken into the body ethyl alcohol depresses activity of the central nervous system (see also alcoholism). *Methyl alcohol (methanol) is extremely poisonous. See Appendix 11.

alcoholic hallucinosis *hallucinations in the context of *alcoholism. They are usually shortlived *auditory hallucinations (‘hearing voices’). Although abstinence is the best remedy, they can persist beyond the active use of alcohol and are often difficult to treat (a recent review showed a dearth of data regarding all possible treatment options).

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) an international voluntary agency of mutual support that is organized and operated locally among those with alcohol dependency. Members are expected to follow a 12-step programme, which includes admitting to their drink problems, recognizing a higher spiritual power that gives strength to overcome these problems, and helping and supporting fellow members.

alcoholism n. the syndrome due to physical *dependence on alcohol, such that sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms – tremor, anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions (see delirium tremens). The risk of alcoholism for an individual depends on genetic and environmental factors. Several years’ heavy drinking is often needed for addiction to develop, with a wide range from 1 to 40 years. Alcoholism impairs intellectual function, physical skills, memory, and judgment. Social skills can also be affected. Heavy consumption of alcohol causes *cardiomyopathy, *peripheral neuropathy, *cirrhosis of the liver, and enteritis. Treatment is usually provided on an out-patient basis, in specialist units for detoxification or medical wards. Unsupervised sudden withdrawal carries a mortality of about 10%, mostly due to seizures. If there are complicating psychiatric problems detoxification may be part of psychiatric treatment. Psychological aspects of treatment include helping the patient to understand the psychological pressures that led to his or her heavy drinking, treatment of underlying anxiety, and *motivational interviewing. Drugs such as *disulfiram (Antabuse), which cause vomiting if alcohol is taken, can help in treatment. Drugs to reduce craving, such as *acamprosate calcium, are less successful, with around a third of patients benefiting.

aldesleukin n. see interleukin.

aldosterone n. a steroid hormone (see corticosteroid) that is synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex and acts on the kidney to regulate salt (potassium and sodium) and water balance.

aldosteronism (hyperaldosteronism) n. overproduction of aldosterone, one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex, usually due to a benign tumour (adenoma) in the cortex or hyperplasia of that tissue. It leads to abnormalities in the amounts of sodium, potassium, and water in the body. It is a rare cause of raised blood pressure (hypertension). See also Conn’s syndrome.

alendronic acid (sodium alendronate) a *bisphosphonate drug that is administered for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and fragility fractures in men and postmenopausal women or induced by corticosteroid therapy in women. Immediate side-effects may include abdominal pain, indigestion, and oesophageal irritation or pain. Long-term use (5–10 years) may increase the risk of poor dental healing and atypical fractures of the thigh bone (femur).

Aleppo boil see oriental sore.

alerting device see environmental hearing aid.

alexia n. an acquired inability to read. It is due to disease in the left (dominant) hemisphere of the brain in a right-handed person. In agnosic alexia (word blindness) the patient cannot read because he is unable to identify the letters and words, but he retains the ability to write and his speech is normal. This is a form of *agnosia. A patient with aphasic alexia (visual asymbolia) can neither read nor write and often has an accompanying disorder of speech. This is a form of *aphasia. See also dyslexia.

alexin n. a former name for the serum component now called *complement.

alexithymia n. an inability to express one’s emotions or describe them in words, commonly accompanied by a lack of empathy for the feelings of others. Most often seen in males, it is associated with autistic spectrum disorders (see autism) and also with certain eating disorders.

-algia combining form denoting pain. Example: neuralgia (pain in a nerve).

algid adj. cold: usually describing the cold clammy skin associated with certain forms of malaria.

alginates pl. n. derivatives of alginic acid, a complex carbohydrate extracted from certain brown seaweeds, that readily absorb water to form a gel. Alginates are included in many *antacid preparations (e.g. Gaviscon) for the relief of heartburn caused by *gastro-oesophageal reflux because they form a layer on the stomach contents that protects the oesophagus from acid reflux. As they are highly absorbent, alginates are also used in dressings for exuding wounds.

algodystrophy n. a specific post-traumatic syndrome after nerve injury, in which a limb remains exquisitely sensitive to any stimulus and later develops disuse *atrophy. See complex regional pain syndrome.

algoliptin see DPP-IV inhibitors.

algorithm n. a sequential set of instructions used in calculations or problem solving. A reconstruction algorithm is a complex mathematical formula used by a computer to construct images from the data acquired by CT, MRI, or other scanners. A diagnostic algorithm or a therapeutic algorithm consists of a stepwise series of instructions with branching pathways to be followed to assist a physician in coming to a diagnosis or deciding on a management strategy, respectively.

alienation n. 1. a feeling of estrangement, important to overcome in communication with patients who are from different cultures or backgrounds from the clinician. 2. (in psychiatry) see thought alienation.

alien limb syndrome a rare neurological condition in which upper limb movements occur without an individual’s awareness of or control over the actions. In extreme cases, a person will deliberately use their other arm to restrain the ‘alien limb’. It is caused by damage to connections between the cerebral hemispheres or the frontal or occipital brain areas and can occur following stroke or in dementia.

alimemazine n. an *antihistamine drug (a *phenothiazine derivative) that also possesses sedative properties. It is mainly used in the treatment of pruritus (itching) and urticaria (nettle rash), but also for premedication. Common side-effects include drowsiness, dizziness, dryness of mouth, muscular tremor and incoordination, and confusion.

alimentary canal the long passage through which food passes to be digested and absorbed (see illustration). It extends from the mouth to the anus and each region is specialized for a different stage in the processing of food, from mechanical breakdown in the mouth to chemical *digestion and *absorption in the stomach and small intestine and finally to faeces formation and water absorption in the colon and rectum.

The alimentary canal.





alitretinoin n. see retinoid.

alizarin (alizarin carmine) n. an orange-red dye derived from coal tar and originally isolated from the plant madder (Rubia tinctorum). Alizarin is insoluble in water but dissolves in alkalis, alcohol, and ether. It is used as a pH indicator and as a histochemical reagent for calcium, thallium, titanium, and zirconium.

ALK see automated lamellar keratectomy.

alkalaemia n. abnormally high blood alkalinity. This may be caused by an increase in the concentration of alkaline substances and/or a decrease in that of acidic substances in the blood. See also alkalosis. Compare acidaemia.

alkaloid n. one of a diverse group of nitrogen-containing substances that are produced by plants and have potent effects on body function. Many alkaloids are important drugs, including *morphine, *quinine, *atropine, and *codeine.

alkalosis n. a condition in which the alkalinity of body fluids and tissues is abnormally high. This arises because of a failure of the mechanisms that usually maintain a balance between alkalis and acids in the arterial blood (see acid-base balance). Alkalosis may be associated with loss of acid through vomiting or with excessive sodium bicarbonate intake. Breathing that is abnormally deep in relation to the amount of physical exercise may lead to respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis may produce symptoms of muscular weakness or cramp.

alkaptonuria n. see alcaptonuria.

alkylating agents a class of chemotherapy drugs that includes *cyclophosphamide, *ifosfamide, and *melphalan. These drugs bind to DNA and prevent complete separation of the two DNA chains during cell division. Side-effects are those of other *cytotoxic drugs; in addition, alkylating agents interfere with *gametogenesis and may cause sterility in men.

allantois n. the membranous sac that develops as an outgrowth of the embryonic hindgut. Its outer (mesodermal) layer carries blood vessels to the *placenta and so forms part of the *umbilical cord. Its cavity is small and becomes reduced further in size during fetal development (see urachus). —allantoic adj.

allele (allelomorph) n. one of two or more alternative forms of a *gene, only one of which can be present in a chromosome. Two alleles of a particular gene occupy the same relative positions on a pair of *homologous chromosomes. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is *homozygous for the gene; if they are different he is *heterozygous. See also dominant; recessive. —allelic adj.

allelomorph n. see allele.

allergen n. any *antigen that causes *allergy in a hypersensitive person. Allergens are diverse and affect different tissues and organs. Pollens, fur, feathers, mould, and dust may cause hay fever; house-dust mites (see Dermatophagoides) have been implicated in some forms of asthma; drugs, dyes, cosmetics, and a host of other chemicals can cause rashes and dermatitis; some food allergies may cause diarrhoea or constipation or simulate acute bacterial food poisoning. When a patient’s allergen has been identified (see patch test), it may be possible to attempt *desensitization to alleviate or prevent allergic attacks. —allergenic adj.

allergy n. a disorder in which the body becomes hypersensitive to particular antigens (called *allergens), which provoke characteristic symptoms whenever they are subsequently inhaled, ingested, injected, or otherwise contacted. Normally antibodies in the bloodstream and tissues react with and destroy specific antigens without further trouble. In an allergic person, however, the allergens provoke the release of a class of antibodies (IgE) that become bound to *mast cells in the body’s tissues. The subsequent reaction of allergen with tissue-bound antibody (see reagin) also leads, as a side-effect, to cell damage, release of *histamine and *serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), inflammation, and all the symptoms of the particular allergy. Different allergies afflict different tissues and may have either local or general effects, varying from asthma and hay fever to severe dermatitis or gastroenteritis or extremely serious shock (see anaphylaxis). —allergic adj.

allogeneic adj. describing grafted tissue derived from a donor of the same species as the recipient.

allograft (homograft) n. a living tissue or organ graft between two members of the same species; for example, a heart transplant from one person to another. Such grafts will not survive unless the recipient is treated to suppress his body’s *immune response to the foreign tissue or the grafted organ is from an identical twin. See also transplantation.

alloisoleucine n. one of the isomers of the amino acid isoleucine.

allopathy n. (in homeopathic medicine) the orthodox system of medicine, in which the use of drugs is directed to producing effects in the body that will directly oppose and so alleviate the symptoms of a disease. Compare homeopathy.

alloplasty n. a surgical operation in which a synthetic material, such as stainless steel, replaces a body part or tissue.

allopurinol n. a drug used for the prevention of acute attacks of *gout and of kidney stones. It acts by reducing the level of uric acid in tissues and blood. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fever, stomach pains, and skin rashes. Occasionally, nerve damage and enlargement of the liver may occur.

almotriptan n. see 5HT1 agonist.

alopecia (baldness) n. absence of hair from areas where it normally grows. Non-scarring alopecias include male-pattern balding, which is familial, and androgenetic alopecia in women, in which the hair loss is associated with increasing age. Acute hair fall (telogen effluvium), in which much or all of the hair is shed but may start to regrow at once, may occur after pregnancy or a serious illness. Alopecia areata consists of bald patches that may regrow; it is an example of an organ-specific *autoimmune disease. Alopecia totalis is loss of all the scalp hair, due to an autoimmune condition; in some 70% of cases it regrows within a few years. Alopecia universalis is loss of all body hair. In scarring (or cicatricial) alopecias the hair does not regrow; examples include *lichen planus and discoid *lupus erythematosus.

alpha agonist see sympathomimetic.

alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency a rare inherited disorder associated with lung and liver diseases. It is caused by a deficiency of α1-antitrypsin, a plasma globulin whose role is to inhibit the action of various protease enzymes (including trypsin), which protect the lungs against the action of the enzyme neutrophil elastase. This results in degradation of the *elastin of alveolar walls as well as structural proteins in other tissues, including the liver. Although many patients present in childhood, the disorder can occur in adults as well.

alpha blocker (alpha-adrenergic blocker) a drug that prevents the stimulation of alpha *adrenoceptors at the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system by noradrenaline and adrenaline: it therefore causes relaxation of smooth muscle, including widening of arteries (vasodilatation) and a drop in blood pressure. Alpha blockers include *doxazosin, *phentolamine, *phenoxybenzamine, *indoramin, *prazosin, *alfuzosin, and *tamsulosin.

alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) n. a protein that is formed in the liver and yolk sac of the fetus and is present in the fetal serum and secondarily in maternal blood. Maternal AFP is used as a marker in *prenatal screening tests, which can be performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. Levels are elevated in open *neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida), open abdominal wall defects (e.g. *gastroschisis), fetal death, and multiple pregnancy. Levels of AFP are decreased in *Down’s syndrome. However, AFP levels are affected by the length of gestation and the mother’s weight, and these factors must be considered when interpreting the results. When levels are unexpectedly high or low, further investigations (for example detailed *ultrasonography) are indicated.

Alpha-fetoprotein is also produced by certain tumours, including malignant *teratomas and primary liver tumours (*hepatomas). See tumour marker.

alpha-glucosidase inhibitor any member of a group of *oral hypoglycaemic drugs, including acarbose (Glucobay), used for treating type 2 *diabetes mellitus. They reduce the breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates in the intestine by blocking the action of an important enzyme (α-glucosidase) in this process. Side-effects include flatulence and diarrhoea.

alphavirus n. any member of a genus of *arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes. Many alphaviruses can cause disease in humans and animals, including *O’nyong nyong fever and *Ross River fever.

Alport’s syndrome a hereditary disease that causes *nephritis accompanied by deafness and, less commonly, ocular defects, such as cataracts. Affected males usually develop end-stage renal failure and, unless treated with a kidney transplant, die before the age of 40. Females have a better prognosis. [A. C. Alport (1880–1959), South African physician]

alprazolam n. a *benzodiazepine used for the short-term relief of anxiety. Side-effects include drowsiness and lightheadedness.

alprostadil n. a *prostaglandin drug (PGE1) administered to improve lung blood flow in newborn babies with congenital heart defects who are awaiting surgery; it acts by preventing the closure of the blood vessel connecting the aorta to the pulmonary artery (see ductus arteriosus). Possible side-effects include diminished respiratory efforts. Alprostadil is also administered to treat *erectile dysfunction in men; it acts by relaxing smooth muscle and dilating the cavernosal arteries, so that blood is trapped when the venules become compressed against the *tunica albuginea. Side-effects may include dizziness and headache.

ALS 1. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. See motor neuron disease. 2. see advanced life support. 3. see antilymphocyte serum.

ALT 1. see alanine aminotransferase. 2. argon laser *trabeculoplasty.

alteplase n. a *tissue-type plasminogen activator made by recombinant DNA technology (genetic engineering). Alteplase is used to dissolve blood clots (see fibrinolytic) in the treatment of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Possible side-effects include local bleeding, cerebral haemorrhage, nausea, and vomiting.

alternative medicine see complementary medicine.

altitude sickness (mountain sickness) the condition that results from unaccustomed exposure to a high altitude (4500 m or more above sea level). Reduced atmospheric pressure and shortage of oxygen cause deep rapid breathing (*hyperventilation), which lowers the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood (see alkalosis). Symptoms include nausea, exhaustion, and anxiety. In severe cases there may be acute shortness of breath due to fluid collecting in the lungs (pulmonary *oedema), which requires treatment by diuretics and return to a lower altitude.

altruistic donation a type of organ donation where the donor offers an organ (often a kidney) for transplantation into a stranger. This may form a chain of organ donation to allow a suitable match for the donor’s relative or partner if the pair are incompatible.

aluminium chloride hexahydrate a powerful antiperspirant used in the treatment of conditions associated with excessive sweating (see hyperhidrosis).

aluminium hydroxide a safe slow-acting antacid. It is administered (often in combination with magnesium hydroxide) in the treatment of indigestion, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and reflux *oesophagitis.

alveolar osteotis see dry socket.

alveolitis n. inflammation of an *alveolus or alveoli. Chronic inflammation of the walls of the alveoli of the lungs is usually caused by inhaled organic dusts (extrinsic allergic alveolitis; see bird-fancier’s lung; farmer’s lung) but may occur spontaneously (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, CFA). CFA is now usually called *idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis because the fibrosis seems to precede the alveolitis. It may be associated with connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis.

alveolus n. (pl. alveoli) 1. (in the *lung) a blind-ended air sac of microscopic size. About 30 alveoli open out of each alveolar duct, which leads from a respiratory *bronchiole. The alveolar walls, which separate alveoli, contain capillaries. The alveoli are lined by a single layer of *pneumocytes, which thus form a very thin layer between air and blood so that exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is normally rapid and complete. Children are born with about 20 million alveoli. The adult number of about 300 million is reached around the age of eight. 2. the part of the upper or lower jawbone that supports the roots of the teeth (see also mandible; maxilla). After tooth extraction it is largely absorbed. 3. the sac of a *racemose gland (see also acinus). 4. any other small cavity, depression, or sac. —alveolar adj.

alverine citrate a bulking agent and *antispasmodic drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Side-effects include occasional mild distension of the bowel.

alveus n. a cavity, groove, or canal. The alveus hippocampi is the bundle of nerve fibres in the brain forming a depression in which the hippocampus lies.

Alzheimer’s disease the most common form of *dementia, occurring in middle age or later. It is characterized by memory impairment and, as the disease progresses, language difficulties, *apraxia, and visuospatial problems, leading to a loss of judgment and the inability to carry out even basic functions. At post mortem there are excess deposits of *amyloid protein and *neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. In rare cases of familial Alzheimer’s, mutations in three genes have so far been detected; patients with these genes usually have early-onset dementia. The cause of the common sporadic form is not known although genetic factors can significantly increase the risk of developing the disease. Mutations in four other genes have been implicated in the more common late-onset form of the disease. The demonstration of damage to the cholinergic pathways has led to the development of *acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which have been shown to slow disease progression. Ethical problems in the care of someone who has been used to making their own decisions (but now cannot) include respecting what *autonomy remains, how to gain valid *consent for treatment, and how to allow the patient proper *dignity. [A. Alzheimer (1864–1915), German physician]

amalgam n. an alloy of mercury, especially one used for dental fillings. Dental amalgam is a mixture of mercury with silver, tin, copper, and other trace metals. The components are mixed together in a machine known as an amalgamator.

Amanita n. a genus of fungi that contains several species of poisonous toadstools, including A. phalloides (death cap), A. pantherina (panther cap), and A. muscaria (fly agaric). They produce toxins that cause abdominal pain, violent vomiting, and continuous diarrhoea. In the absence of treatment death occurs in approximately 50% of cases, due to severe liver damage.

amantadine n. an antiviral drug that increases the activity of *dopamine in the brain and is used mainly to treat Parkinson’s disease. Common side-effects include nervousness, loss of muscular coordination, and insomnia.

amaurosis n. partial or complete blindness. For example, amaurosis fugax is a condition in which loss of vision is transient. See also Leber’s congenital amaurosis. —amaurotic adj.

ambitendence n. a psychiatric symptom occasionally seen in *schizophrenia and *catatonia: a state of ambivalence with alternation of cooperation and opposition. For instance, a patient may not know whether or not to shake the interviewer’s hand, constantly shifting between holding the hand out and withdrawing it.

ambivalence n. 1. (in psychology) the condition of holding opposite feelings (such as love and hate) for the same person or object. This can cause relationship difficulties and pathological grief reactions. 2. (in psychiatry) the condition of making varying decisions about a treatment plan without the ability to adhere to the decision agreed.

Amblyomma n. a genus of hard *ticks, several species of which are responsible for transmitting tick *typhus. The bite of this tick can also give rise to a serious and sometimes fatal paralysis.

amblyopia n. poor sight, not due to any detectable disease of the eyeball or visual system, known colloquially as lazy eye. In practice this strict definition is not always obeyed. For example, in toxic amblyopia, caused by tobacco, alcohol, certain other drugs, and vitamin deficiency, there is a disorder of the *optic nerve. The commonest type is amblyopia ex anopsia, in which factors such as squint (see strabismus), cataract, and other abnormalities of the optics of the eye (see refraction) impair its normal use in early childhood by preventing the formation of a clear image on the retina. This in turn leads to a cortical visual impairment.

amblyoscope (orthoptoscope, synoptophore) n. an instrument for measuring the angle of a squint and assessing the degree to which a person uses both eyes together. It consists of two L-shaped tubes, the short arms of which are joined by a hinge so that the long arms point away from each other. The subject looks into the short end and each eye sees, via a system of mirrors and lenses, a different picture, which is placed at the other end of each tube. If a squint is present, the tubes may be adjusted so that the short arms line up with the direction of each eye.

AMD age-related *macular degeneration.

amelia n. congenital total absence of the arms or legs due to a developmental defect. It is one of the fetal abnormalities induced by the drug *thalidomide taken early in pregnancy. See also phocomelia.

ameloblast n. a cell that is only present during tooth development. Ameloblasts secrete and deposit tooth enamel and disappear completely before tooth eruption.

ameloblastoma n. an odontogenic tumour in the jaw. It invades the mandible more commonly than the maxilla and rarely exhibits malignant behaviour. It is considered to develop from ameloblasts although it does not contain enamel.

amelogenesis n. the formation of enamel by *ameloblasts, a process that is completed before tooth eruption. Amelogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary condition in which enamel formation is disturbed. The teeth have an unusual surface but may not be more prone to decay.

amenorrhoea n. the absence or stopping of the menstrual periods. It is normal for the periods to be absent before puberty, during pregnancy and milk secretion, and after the end of the reproductive period (see menopause). In primary amenorrhoea the menstrual periods fail to appear at puberty, due to absence of the uterus or ovaries, a genetic disorder (e.g. *Turner’s syndrome), or hormonal imbalance. It is diagnosed when *menarche has not occurred by the age of 16½ years but there is normal development of secondary sexual characteristics or by the age of 14 years if secondary sexual characteristics are absent. In secondary amenorrhoea the menstrual periods stop after establishment at puberty for a minimum of six months. Causes include disorders of the hypothalamus (a part of the brain), deficiency of ovarian, pituitary, or thyroid hormones, mental disturbance, depression, anorexia nervosa, or a major change of surroundings or circumstances.

American Medical Association (AMA) a professional organization for US physicians. Its purposes include dissemination of scientific information through journals, a weekly newspaper, and a website; representation of the profession to Congress and state legislatures; keeping members informed of pending health and medical legislation; evaluating prescription and non-prescription drugs; and cooperating with other organizations in setting standards for hospitals and medical schools. The AMA maintains a comprehensive directory of licensed physicians in the US.

amethocaine n. see tetracaine.

ametropia n. any abnormality of *refraction of the eye, resulting in blurring of the image formed on the retina. See astigmatism; hypermetropia; myopia. Compare emmetropia.

amfebutamone n. see bupropion.

amiloride n. a potassium-sparing *diuretic that causes the increased excretion of sodium and chloride; it is often combined with a thiazide or loop diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide as co-amilozide) to reduce the potassium loss that occurs with these drugs. Amiloride may produce dizziness and weakness and its continued use may lead to an excessive concentration of potassium in the blood.

amino acid an organic compound containing an amino group (–NH2) and a carboxyl group (–COOH). Amino acids are fundamental constituents of all *proteins. They are classified as *essential amino acids, i.e. those that cannot be synthesized by the body, and nonessential amino acids, which can be synthesized by the body. Certain amino acids present in the body are not found in proteins; these include *citrulline, *ornithine, *taurine, and *gamma-aminobutyric acid.

aminoacidopathy n. see maple syrup urine disease; methylmalonic aciduria.

aminoglycosides pl. n. a group of antibiotics active against a wide range of bacteria. It includes *gentamicin, *neomycin, and *streptomycin. Because of their toxicity (side-effects include ear and kidney damage), these drugs are used only when less toxic antibacterials are ineffective or contraindicated.

aminopeptidase n. any one of several enzymes in the intestine that cause the breakdown of a *peptide, removing an amino acid.

aminophylline n. a drug that relaxes smooth muscle and stimulates respiration. It is widely used to dilate the air passages in the treatment of severe asthma and some cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and fast heart rate. See also theophylline.

aminosalicylates pl. n. drugs containing 5-aminosalicylic acid, used to treat ulcerative colitis (and to maintain patients in remission from it) and Crohn’s disease affecting the colon. They include *sulfasalazine, *olsalazine, and mesalazine.

amitriptyline n. a tricyclic *antidepressant drug that has a mild tranquillizing action. Side-effects can include abnormal heart rhythms, which may be fatal following overdosage, and the drug is now rarely used for depression; it may be used to treat chronic pain.

amlodipine n. a *calcium-channel blocker used to treat hypertension and prevent angina pectoris. Possible side-effects include headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and fluid retention.

amnesia n. total or partial loss of memory following physical injury, disease, drugs, or psychological trauma (see confabulation; fugue; repression). Anterograde amnesia is loss of memory for the events following a trauma; retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events preceding the trauma. Some patients experience both types.

amnestic MCI see mild cognitive impairment.

amnihook n. a small plastic hooked instrument for performing *amniotomy. The hook is introduced through the cervix.

amniocentesis n. withdrawal of a sample of the fluid (*amniotic fluid) surrounding a fetus in the uterus by piercing the amniotic sac through the abdominal wall, under direct ultrasound guidance. As the amniotic fluid contains cells from the fetus (mostly shed from the skin), cell cultures enable chromosome patterns to be studied so that *prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities (such as *Down’s syndrome) can be made. Certain metabolic errors and other abnormalities, such as *spina bifida, can also be diagnosed prenatally from analysis of the cells or of the fluid. Amniocentesis is usually performed at any time from the 15th completed week of gestation; it carries a 1–2% risk of miscarriage.

amnion n. the membrane that forms initially over the dorsal part of the embryo but soon expands to enclose it completely within the *amniotic cavity; it is connected to the embryo at the umbilical cord. It expands outwards and fuses with the chorion, obliterating virtually all the intervening cavity. The double membrane (amniochorion) normally ruptures at birth. —amniotic adj.

amnioreduction n. the removal of amniotic fluid in greater amounts than required for amniocentesis for therapeutic reasons (e.g. *twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, *polyhydramnios).

amniotic cavity the fluid-filled cavity between the embryo and the *amnion. It forms initially within the inner cell mass of the *blastocyst and later expands over the back of the embryo, eventually enclosing it completely. See also amniotic fluid.

amniotic fluid the fluid contained within the *amniotic cavity. It surrounds the growing fetus, protecting it from external pressure. The fluid is initially secreted from the *amnion and is later supplemented by urine from the fetal kidneys. Some of the fluid is swallowed by the fetus and absorbed through its intestine. The volume of amniotic fluid varies according to the stage of gestation: approximate normal values are 500 ml at 18 weeks, rising to a maximum of 800 ml at 34 weeks and falling to 600 ml at term. See also anhydramnios; oligohydramnios; polyhydramnios.

amniotic fluid embolism a condition in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation causing a complex cascade similar to that seen in anaphylactic and septic *shock. It is a rare event (1 in 50,000–100,000 deliveries), with a 60–80% maternal mortality. The sudden onset of cardiopulmonary collapse, together with coma or seizures, in labour or shortly after delivery, should prompt the diagnosis. Most of the women who survive have permanent neurological damage.

amniotomy (artificial rupture of membranes, ARM) n. a method of surgically inducing labour by puncturing the *amnion surrounding the baby in the uterus using an *amnihook or similar instrument.

amobarbital (amylobarbitone) n. an intermediate-acting *barbiturate used to treat severe insomnia in patients already taking barbiturates.

amoeba n. (pl. amoebae) any protozoan of jelly-like consistency and irregular and constantly changing shape. Found in water, soil and other damp environments, they move and feed by means of flowing extensions of the body (see pseudopodium). Some amoebae cause disease in humans (see Acanthamoeba; Entamoeba). —amoebic adj.

amoebiasis n. see dysentery.

amoebocyte n. a cell that moves by sending out processes of its protoplasm in the same way as an amoeba.

amoeboma n. a rare manifestation of chronic or partially treated amoebic *dysentery leading to the development of a nonmalignant inflammatory mass in the bowel. It can occur in the caecum, appendix, and *rectosigmoid area in descending order of frequency. Amoebomas can cause symptoms of *intestinal obstruction, weight loss, and low-grade fever. Colonic amoeboma with multiple amoebic liver abscesses can masquerade as colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases; imaging with ultrasound and CT scan is used to differentiate between these.

amok n. a sudden outburst of furious and murderous aggression, directed indiscriminately at everybody in the vicinity.

amorolfine n. an antifungal drug used to treat fungal infections of the skin and nails. Possible side-effects include itching and a transient burning sensation.

amoxicillin n. a semisynthetic *penicillin used to treat infections caused by a wide range of bacteria and other microorganisms (see also beta-lactam antibiotic). Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, rashes, and anaemia. Sensitivity to penicillin prohibits its use.

AMP (adenosine monophosphate) a compound containing adenine, ribose, and one phosphate group. AMP occurs in cells and is involved in processes requiring the transfer of energy (see ATP).

ampere n. the basic *SI unit of electric current. It is equal to the current flowing through a conductor of resistance 1 ohm when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied between its ends. The formal definition of the ampere is the current that when passed through two parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible cross section, placed 1 metre apart in a vacuum, produces a force of 2 × 10−7 newton per metre between them. Symbol: A.

amphetamines pl. n. a group of *sympathomimetic drugs that have a marked *stimulant action on the central nervous system, alleviating fatigue and producing a feeling of mental alertness and wellbeing. Dexamfetamine (dexamphetamine) is used in the treatment of *narcolepsy and in selected cases of *attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children. Side-effects include insomnia and restlessness. *Tolerance to amphetamines develops rapidly, and prolonged use may lead to *dependence; these drugs should not be used to treat depressive illness or obesity.

amphiarthrosis n. a slightly movable joint in which the bony surfaces are separated by fibrocartilage (see symphysis) or hyaline cartilage (see synchondrosis).

amphoric breath sounds see breath sounds.

amphotericin n. an *antifungal drug that is used to treat deep-seated fungal infections. Common side-effects include headache, fever, muscle pains, and diarrhoea; more severe side-effects, such as kidney damage, can be reduced if the drug is administered in a lipid preparation (see liposome).

ampicillin n. a semisynthetic *penicillin used to treat a variety of infections, including those of the urinary, respiratory, biliary, and intestinal tracts. It is inactivated by *penicillinase and therefore cannot be used against organisms producing this enzyme. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and some allergic reactions may occur.

ampoule (ampule) n. a sealed glass or plastic capsule containing one dose of a drug in the form of a sterile solution for injection.

ampulla n. (pl. ampullae) an enlarged or dilated ending of a tube or canal. The semicircular canals of the inner ear are expanded into ampullae at the point where they join the vestibule. The ampulla of Vater is the dilated part of the common bile duct where it is joined by the pancreatic duct.

amputation n. the removal of a limb, part of a limb, or any other portion of the body (such as a breast or the rectum). The term is customarily modified by an adjective showing the particular type of amputation. Examples include above-knee, through-knee, and below-knee amputations of the lower limb. Limb amputation may be performed for gangrene or severe infections precipitated by conditions such as severe peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus, where other techniques are not possible. It is also performed in cases of severe limb injury. In planning an amputation the surgeon takes account of the blood supply, the patient’s mobility, and the type of artificial part (prosthesis) that will be fitted. It is not uncommon for patients to continue to have physical sensations in the body part that has been removed (*phantom limb).

Amsler grid a chart usually consisting of a grid of black lines on a white background. It is used to detect and monitor problems of central vision affecting the retina; for example, in early macular disease, the square edges of the grid may appear distorted. [M. Amsler (1891–1968), Swiss ophthalmologist]

amygdala (amygdaloid nucleus) n. one of the *basal ganglia and part of the *limbic system: a roughly almond-shaped mass of grey matter deep inside each cerebral hemisphere. It has extensive connections with the olfactory system and sends nerve fibres to the hypothalamus; its functions are concerned with perception of threat, fear, learning, emotion, and memory.

amylase n. an enzyme that occurs in saliva and pancreatic juice and aids the digestion of starch, which it breaks down into glucose, maltose, and dextrins. Amylase will also hydrolyse *glycogen to yield glucose, maltose, and dextrins.

amylobarbitone n. see amobarbital.

amyloid n. a *glycoprotein, resembling starch, that is deposited in the internal organs in amyloidosis. β-amyloid protein has been found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients but the significance of this is unclear.

amyloidosis n. infiltration of the liver, kidneys, spleen, and other tissues with amyloid, a starchlike substance. In primary amyloidosis the disorder arises without any apparent cause; secondary amyloidosis occurs as a late complication of such chronic infections as tuberculosis or leprosy and also in *Hodgkin’s disease. Amyloidosis is also very common in the genetic disease familial Mediterranean fever (see polyserositis).

amylopectin n. see starch.

amylose n. see starch.

amyotonia congenita (floppy baby syndrome) a former diagnosis for various conditions, present at birth, in which the baby’s muscles are weak and floppy (i.e. hypotonic). The term is becoming obsolete as more specific diagnoses are discovered to explain the cause of floppiness in babies.

amyotrophy n. a progressive loss of muscle bulk (wasting) associated with weakness of these muscles. It is caused by disease of the motor nerve that activates the affected muscle. Amyotrophy is a feature of any chronic *neuropathy and it may be found in some diabetic patients (see diabetic amyotrophy). A combination of amyotrophy and spasticity may be found in the different forms of *motor neuron disease.

an- prefix. see a-.

ANA see antinuclear antibody.

anabolic adj. promoting tissue growth by increasing the metabolic processes involved in protein synthesis. Anabolic steroids are synthetic forms of male sex hormones (see androgen); they include *nandrolone. They were formerly used to help weight gain in underweight patients, such as the elderly and those with serious illnesses, but are now used mainly to stimulate the production of blood cells by the bone marrow in some forms of aplastic anaemia. Some anabolic steroids cause virilization in women and liver damage.

anabolism n. the synthesis of complex molecules, such as proteins and fats, from simpler ones by living things. See also anabolic; metabolism.

anacidity n. a deficiency or abnormal absence of acid in the body fluids.

anacrotism n. the condition in which there is an abnormal curve in the ascending line of a pulse tracing. It may be seen in cases of aortic stenosis. —anacrotic adj.

anaemia n. a reduction in the quantity of the oxygen-carrying pigment *haemoglobin in the blood. The main symptoms are excessive tiredness and fatigability, breathlessness on exertion, pallor, and poor resistance to infection.

There are many causes of anaemia. It may be due to loss of blood (haemorrhagic anaemia), resulting from an accident, operation, etc., or from chronic bleeding, as from an ulcer or haemorrhoids. Iron-deficiency anaemia results from lack of iron, which is necessary for the production of haemoglobin (see sideropenia). Haemolytic anaemias result from the increased destruction of red blood cells (which contain the pigment). This can be caused by toxic chemicals; *autoimmunity; the action of parasites, especially in *malaria; or conditions such as *thalassaemia and *sickle-cell disease, associated with abnormal forms of haemoglobin, or *spherocytosis, which is associated with abnormal red blood cells. (See also haemolytic disease of the newborn.) Anaemia can also be caused by the impaired production of red blood cells, as in *leukaemia (when red-cell production in the bone marrow is suppressed) or *pernicious anaemia. Aplastic anaemia is characterized by a failure of blood cell production resulting in *pancytopenia and reduced bone marrow cellularity.

Anaemias can be classified on the basis of the size of the red cells, which may be large (macrocytic anaemias), small (microcytic anaemias), or normal-sized (normocytic anaemias). (See also macrocytosis; microcytosis.) The treatment of anaemia depends on the cause. —anaemic adj.

anaerobe n. any organism, especially a microbe, that is able to live and grow in the absence of free oxygen. A facultative anaerobe is a microorganism that grows best in the presence of oxygen but is capable of some growth in its absence. An obligate anaerobe can grow only in the absence of free oxygen. Compare aerobe; microaerophilic.

anaerobic adj. 1. of or relating to anaerobes. 2. describing a type of cellular respiration in which foodstuffs (usually carbohydrates) are never completely oxidized because molecular oxygen is not used. *Fermentation is an example of anaerobic respiration.

anaesthesia n. loss of feeling or sensation in a part or all of the body. Anaesthesia of a part of the body may occur as a result of injury to or disease of a nerve; for example in trauma. The term is usually applied, however, to the technique of reducing or abolishing an individual’s sensation of pain to enable surgery to be performed. This is effected by administering drugs (see anaesthetic).

General anaesthesia is total unconsciousness, usually achieved by administering a combination of injections and gases (the latter are inhaled through a mask). Local anaesthesia abolishes pain in a limited area of the body and is used for minor operations, particularly many dental procedures. It may be achieved by injections of substances such as lidocaine close to a local nerve, which deadens the tissues supplied by that nerve. Local anaesthesia may be combined with intravenous sedation. An appropriate injection into the spinal column produces *spinal anaesthesia or *epidural anaesthesia in the lower limbs or abdomen. Regional anaesthesia, usually of a limb, is achieved by encircling local anaesthetic solutions or direct application of anaesthetic to one or more peripheral nerves.

anaesthetic 1. n. an agent that reduces or abolishes sensation, affecting either the whole body (general anaesthetic) or a particular area or region (local anaesthetic). General anaesthetics, used for surgical procedures, depress activity of the central nervous system, producing loss of consciousness. *Anaesthesia is induced by intravenous anaesthetics, such as *thiopental, etomidate, or propofol, and maintained by inhalation anaesthetics (such as *sevoflurane). Local anaesthetics inhibit conduction of impulses in sensory nerves in the region where they are injected or applied; they include *tetracaine, *bupivacaine, and *lidocaine. 2. adj. reducing or abolishing sensation.

anaesthetist n. a medically qualified doctor who administers an anaesthetic to induce unconsciousness in a patient before a surgical operation.

anagen n. the growth phase of a hair follicle, lasting two to three years. It is followed by a transitional stage, called catagen, which lasts for about two weeks, and then a resting phase, telogen. On average about 85% of hairs are in anagen and hence growing actively. There are about 100,000 hairs on the human scalp and up to 100 may be shed each day.

anákhré n. see goundou.

anakinra n. a *biological therapy that inhibits *interleukin 1, an inflammatory *cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. It reduces long-term cartilage and joint damage and is self-administered subcutaneously on a daily basis. Risk of infection and allergy, including mild injection-site reactions, may occur and last several weeks.

anal adj. of, relating to, or affecting the anus; for example an anal *fissure or an anal *fistula.

anal canal the terminal portion of the large intestine, which is surrounded by the muscles of defecation (anal sphincters). The canal ends on the surface at the anal orifice (see anus).

analeptic (respiratory stimulant) n. a drug that acts on the central nervous system to stimulate the muscles involved in breathing. Analeptics, such as *doxapram, are used to treat respiratory depression and respiratory failure.

anal fissure a break or rent of the mucosa of the anal canal, which commonly presents with anal pain during and immediately following defecation and the passage of bright red blood in the stools. Anal fissures may occur secondary to constipation and having to forcefully strain during the process of defecation or as a consequence of prolonged episodes of diarrhoea. Over time an anal fissure may fail to heal, leading to the development of a chronic fissure that is prone to perianal infection. Medical treatment includes stool softeners and topical smooth muscle relaxants (such as 2% diltiazem cream). Surgery for anal fissures refractory to medical treatment includes lateral sphincterotomy (cutting the muscle of the anal sphincter).

analgesia n. reduced sensibility to pain, without loss of consciousness and without the sense of touch necessarily being affected. The condition may arise accidentally, if nerves are diseased or damaged, or be induced deliberately by the use of pain-killing drugs (see analgesic). Strictly speaking, local *anaesthesia should be called local analgesia. See also relative analgesia.

analgesic 1. n. a drug that relieves pain. Nonopioid analgesics, such as *aspirin and *paracetamol, are used for the relief of headache, toothache, and mild rheumatic pain. More potent opioid analgesics, such as *morphine, *pethidine, *alfentanil, and *buprenorphine, are used to relieve moderate or severe pain; these drugs may produce *dependence and *tolerance (see opiate). Some analgesics, including aspirin and *indometacin, also reduce fever and inflammation and are used in rheumatic and other inflammatory conditions (see NSAID). 2. adj. relieving pain.

analgesic nephropathy n. disease of the *tubulointerstitium of the kidney associated with chronic use of mixed analgesic preparations. Phenacetin, paracetamol, and salicylates have all been implicated. The condition is progressive and results in bilateral atrophy of the kidneys and chronic renal failure. In the early stages the condition is asymptomatic. The earliest clinical manifestations relate to disordered tubular function with impaired concentration and acidification of the urine.

anal incontinence see incontinence.

analogous adj. 1. describing organs or parts that have similar functions in different organisms although they do not have the same evolutionary origin or development. Compare homologous 2. (in ethics) describing a case, justification, or argument that is similar to the case in question and so may be used to help to reach a conclusion. See also analysis; casuistry.

analogue n. a drug that differs in minor ways in molecular structure from its parent compound. Examples are *calcipotriol (an analogue of vitamin D), *betahistine (an analogue of histamine), and the *gonadorelin analogues. Useful analogues of existing drugs are either more potent or cause fewer side-effects. *Carboplatin and *oxaliplatin, for example, are less toxic analogues of *cisplatin.

analogue image a traditional X-ray image on film that is in shades that range smoothly from black to white with no appreciable steps from one shade of grey to the next (see grey scale). Analogue images can be converted to digital format (see digitization) for manipulation and storage by computers and other electronic devices.

anal sphincter tears see perineal tear; obstetric anal sphincter injury.

analysis n. 1. (in psychology) any means of understanding complex mental processes or experiences. There are several systems of analysis used by different schools of psychology; for example, *psychoanalysis; transactional analysis, in which people’s relationships are explained in psychoanalytic terms; and functional analysis, in which a particular kind of behaviour is thoroughly described with reference to its frequency, its antecedents, and its consequences. 2. (in ethics) the process of assessing the different moral and medical justifications or arguments for particular approaches to a problem. These need to be weighed up in order to reach an appropriate conclusion.

anamnesis n. a medical, psychiatric, or dental history before the onset of the condition being investigated, based on the patient’s personal account.

anankastic adj. describing a collection of longstanding personality traits in ICD-10 (see International Classification of Diseases), including stubbornness, meanness, an over-meticulous concern to be accurate in small details, a disposition to check things unnecessarily, severe feelings of insecurity about personal worth, and an excessive tendency to doubt evident facts. These traits, sometimes described as obsessional traits, can amount to a *personality disorder if they are severe.

anaphase n. the third stage of *mitosis and of each division of *meiosis. In mitosis and anaphase II of meiosis the chromatids separate, becoming daughter chromosomes, and move apart along the spindle fibres towards opposite ends of the cell. In anaphase I of meiosis the pairs of homologous chromosomes separate from each other. See disjunction.

anaphylaxis n. an emergency condition resulting from an abnormal and immediate allergic response to a substance to which the body has become intensely sensitized. It results in flushing, itching, nausea and vomiting, swelling of the mouth and tongue and airway enough to often cause obstruction, wheezing, a sudden drop in blood pressure, and even sudden death. In this extreme form it is called anaphylactic shock. Common causes are peanuts, latex, and wasp or bee stings. Treatment, which must be given immediately, consists of adrenaline (epinephrine) injection, oxygen with possible advanced support of the airway, intravenous fluids, intravenous corticosteroids, and antihistamines. —anaphylactic adj.

anaplasia n. a loss of normal cell characteristics or differentiation, which may be to such a degree that it is impossible to define the origin of the cells. Anaplasia is typical of rapidly growing malignant tumours, which are described as anaplastic.

anasarca n. massive swelling of the legs, trunk, and genitalia due to retention of fluid (*oedema): found in congestive heart failure and some forms of renal failure.

anastomosis n. 1. (in anatomy) a communication between two blood vessels without an intervening capillary network. See arteriovenous anastomosis. 2. (in surgery) the surgical joining of two hollow organs, such as different parts of the intestines or blood vessels, in order to bypass disease or resected tissue and to restore continuity of the affected organ. See also shunt.

anastrazole n. see aromatase inhibitor.

anatomical position the internationally accepted body position for anatomical descriptions, such that any part of the body can be related to any other part of it. A person in the anatomical position stands erect, the arms hanging by the sides with the palms facing frontwards and the legs and feet together with the toes pointing forwards (see illustration overleaf).

The anatomical position.





anatomical snuffbox the triangular area on the most radial and distal aspect of the wrist overlying the *scaphoid bone and bounded by the extensor tendons of the thumb. It is often tender in injuries to the scaphoid (see scaphoid fracture).

anatomy n. the study of the structure of living organisms. In medicine it refers to the study of the form and gross structure of the various parts of the human body. The term morphology is sometimes used synonymously with anatomy but it is usually used for comparative anatomy: the study of differences in form between species. See also cytology; histology; physiology. —anatomical adj. —anatomist n.

anatoxin n. a former name for *toxoid.

ANCA antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies: autoantibodies associated with various vasculitic syndromes, including *granulomatosis with polyangiitis, *microscopic polyangiitis, and *Churg–Strauss syndrome. ANCA have long been suspected of having a pathogenic role.

anconeus n. a muscle behind the elbow that assists in extending the forearm.

Ancylostoma (Ankylostoma) n. a genus of small parasitic nematodes (see hookworm) that inhabit the small intestine and are widely distributed in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. The worms suck blood from the gut wall, to which they are attached by means of cutting teeth. Humans are the principal and optimum hosts for A. duodenale.

ancylostomiasis n. an infestation of the small intestine by the parasitic hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale. See hookworm disease.

Anderson–Fabry disease see Fabry disease.

ANDI an acronym for abnormal development and involution, used to tabulate benign disorders of the breast.

andr- (andro-) combining form denoting men or the male sex. Example: androphobia (morbid fear of).

androblastoma (arrhenoblastoma) n. a rare tumour of the ovary, composed of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, or both. It can produce male or female hormones and may give rise to *masculinization; in children it may cause precocious puberty. Up to 30% of these tumours are malignant, but probably as many as 85% of all cases are cured by surgery alone.

androgen n. one of a group of steroid hormones, including *testosterone and *dihydrotestosterone, that stimulate the development of male sex organs and male secondary sexual characteristics (e.g. beard growth, deepening of the voice, and muscle development). The principal source of these hormones is the testis (production being stimulated by *luteinizing hormone) but they are also secreted by the adrenal cortex (see dehydroepiandrosterone) and ovaries in small amounts. In women excessive production of androgens gives rise to *masculinization.

Naturally occurring and synthetic androgens are used in replacement therapy (to treat such conditions as delayed puberty in adolescent boys, *hypogonadism, and impotence due to testicular insufficiency) and as *anabolic agents. Side-effects include salt and water retention, increased bone growth, and masculinization in women. Androgens should not be used in patients with cancer of the prostate gland or in pregnant women. —androgenic adj.

androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) an X-linked (see sex-linked) disorder in which the body does not react to androgens because of structural abnormalities in androgen receptors. In its most extreme form, complete AIS (formerly known as testicular feminization syndrome), there is a fully female body appearance with breast development and a short vagina (but no uterus; testes are present internally). Psychosexuality is female orientated. Partial AIS is also known as *Reifenstein’s syndrome.

androgenization n. the final effects of the exposure of sensitive tissues to androgens, i.e. the development of secondary male sexual characteristics. Androgenization can also occur abnormally in females, who may develop excessive body hair, male-pattern baldness, and *clitoromegaly.

andrology n. 1. the study of male infertility and erectile dysfunction. *Seminal analysis reveals the presence of gross abnormalities in the shape and motility of spermatozoa, as well as their concentration in the semen, but further procedures are required to diagnose the underlying causes of the sperm dysfunction. These include the diagnosis of abnormalities in the genital tract (e.g. varicocele, obstruction of the vas deferens), which may be corrected surgically, and testing for the presence of antisperm antibodies in the semen and for the ability of the sperm to penetrate the cervical mucus, as well as for the presence of hormonal disorders. More sophisticated techniques include computer-assisted quantitative motility measurements, which monitor the precise speed and motility patterns of individual sperm; biochemical tests for the production of free oxygen radicals, which cause damage to developing sperm; and *acrosome-reaction assays, which reveal the ability of the sperm to penetrate the barriers surrounding the ovum. The development of all these techniques has enabled the identification of several previously undiagnosed causes of infertility and the selection of treatments most likely to succeed in remedying them. 2. the study of androgen production and the relationship of plasma androgen to androgen action. This study is necessary to understand *hirsutism and other conditions caused by abnormal androgen production.

andropause n. the decline in production of testosterone that occurs with age in men. Unlike the female menopause, there is no circumscribed time at which testosterone production irreversibly ceases. Instead it tends to undergo a steady reduction from the third decade onwards.

androstenedione n. see adrenarche; dehydroepiandrosterone; testosterone.

androsterone n. a steroid that is formed in the liver as a metabolite of testosterone. See also androgen.

anencephaly n. partial or complete absence of the bones of the rear of the skull, the meninges, and the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. It occurs as a developmental defect, and most affected infants are stillborn; if born live they do not survive for more than a few hours. Anencephaly is often associated with other defects of the nervous system, such as *spina bifida. Prenatal screening tests for anencephaly include detection of alpha-fetoprotein levels and ultrasound scanning.

anergy n. 1. lack of response to a specific antigen or allergen. 2. lack of energy. —anergic adj.

aneuploidy n. the condition in which the chromosome number of a cell is not an exact multiple of the normal basic (haploid) number. See monosomy; trisomy. Compare euploidy. —aneuploid adj., n.

aneurine n. see vitamin B1.

aneurysm n. an abnormal balloon-like swelling in the wall of an artery. This may be due to degenerative disease or infection, which damages the muscular coats of the vessel, or it may be the result of congenital deficiency in the muscular wall. An aortic aneurysm most frequently occurs in the abdominal aorta, below the level of the renal arteries. Beyond a certain size it is prone to rupture, presenting as an acute surgical emergency with abdominal and back pain and haemorrhagic shock. A dissecting aneurysm usually affects the thoracic aorta and results from a degenerative condition of its muscular coat. This weakness predisposes to a tear in the lining of the aorta, which allows blood to enter the wall and track along (dissect) the muscular coat. A dissecting aneurysm may rupture or it may compress the blood vessels arising from the aorta and produce infarction (localized necrosis) in the organs they supply. The patient complains of severe chest pain that has a tearing quality and often spreads to the back, shoulder, or abdomen. Emergency surgical repair is indicated (see endovascular aneurysm repair). A ventricular aneurysm may develop in the wall of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction. A segment of myocardium becomes replaced by scar tissue, which expands to form an aneurysmal sac. Heart failure may result or thrombosis within the aneurysm may act as a source of *embolism. See also arteriovenous aneurysm.

Most aneurysms within the brain are congenital: there is a risk that they may burst, causing a *subarachnoid haemorrhage. Berry aneurysms are small saccular aneurysms most commonly occurring in the branches of the *circle of Willis. Usually associated with congenital weakness of the vessels, these aneurysms are a cause of fatal intracranial haemorrhage in young adults. Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms are small aneurysms found on tiny arteries within the brain of elderly and hypertensive subjects. These aneurysms may rupture, causing cerebral haemorrhage. Options for treatment of cerebral aneurysms include surgical clipping of the aneurysm and placing metallic coils within the aneurysm to establish a clot within it (endovascular *coiling).

In a pseudoaneurysm (or false aneurysm) the swelling of the artery is contained by clotted blood rather than the wall of the artery. —aneurysmal adj.

Angelman syndrome a neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delay, absence of speech, seizures, a jerky puppet-like gait (see ataxia), and paroxysmal laughter (giving it the alternative name happy puppet syndrome). Affected children commonly have cranial and facial abnormalities, such as a small or flattened head. Angelman syndrome is a prototype of genomic *imprinting: a deletion on maternal chromosome 15 is the cause in a majority of cases. [H. Angelman (1915–96), British paediatrician]

angi- (angio-) combining form denoting blood or lymph vessels. Examples: angiectasis (abnormal dilation of); angiopathy (disease of); angiotomy (cutting of).

angiitis n. see vasculitis.

angina n. a sense of suffocation or suffocating pain. See angina pectoris; Ludwig’s angina.

angina pectoris pain in the centre of the chest, which is induced by exercise and relieved by rest and may spread to the jaws and arms. Angina pectoris occurs when the demand for blood by the heart exceeds the supply of the coronary arteries and it usually results from coronary artery *atheroma. It may be prevented or relieved by such drugs as *glyceryl trinitrate and *beta blockers. If drug treatment proves ineffective, *coronary angioplasty or *coronary artery bypass grafts may be required, the former being less invasive than the latter.

angiodysplasia n. an abnormal collection of small blood vessels found in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, which are thought to be due to degeneration of previously healthy blood vessels. Angiodysplasia may be isolated lesions or found in clusters; they are located predominately in the caecum or ascending colon and they may bleed or contribute to iron-deficiency anaemia. Angiodysplasia may be diagnosed at endoscopy or angiography. Treatment includes endoscopic coagulation with *diathermy, *argon plasma coagulation, *embolization at angiography, or surgical resection in cases not responding to other treatments.

angiogenesis n. the formation of new blood vessels, which occurs during wound healing and is promoted by growth factors (see vascular endothelial growth factor). This process is also seen in many malignant tumours and has become a target for anticancer therapy (see angiogenesis inhibitor).

angiogenesis inhibitor an agent that prevents the development of new blood vessels (*angiogenesis) by inhibiting the action of *vascular endothelial growth factor (it is also known as anti-VEGF). Angiogenesis inhibitors are used as anticancer drugs, since growing cancers have a greater need for blood supply than normal tissue and must develop new blood vessels before progressing beyond a very small size. They include *aflibercept, *bevacizumab, and *thalidomide. Because of their action, some of these drugs are used in the treatment of wet age-related *macular degeneration.

angiography n. imaging of blood vessels (see also coronary angiography; lymphangiography). In the older form of angiography X-ray imaging was carried out after injection of *radiopaque contrast medium and *digital subtraction applied to enhance visualization. The use of X-rays has now been largely replaced by methods using MRI or CT scanners. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be performed with (contrast-enhanced) or without (noncontrast) injection of a magnetic resonance contrast agent (see contrast medium). Contrast-enhanced MRA will show the vessels better. These images can be reconstructed in two or three dimensions. Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) uses a radiographic contrast agent, usually injected into a vein, to increase the visibility of the blood vessels. Fluorescein angiography is a common method of investigation in ophthalmology. *Fluorescein sodium is injected into a vein in the arm, from which it circulates throughout the body. Light of an appropriate wavelength is shone into the eye, causing the dye in the retinal blood vessels to fluoresce. This allows the circulation through the retinal blood vessels to be observed and photographed. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography uses indocyanine green dye, which fluoresces in infrared light. It is valuable in assessing circulation in the deeper layers of the *fundus.

angioid streaks reddish to dark-brown irregular streaks radiating outwards from the optic disc underneath the retina. They represent irregular linear cracks in *Bruch’s membrane and can be the site for the development of new vessels from the choroid. They are seen in such systemic conditions as pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Paget’s disease, and sickle-cell anaemia.

angiokeratoma n. a localized collection of thin-walled blood vessels covered by a cap of warty material. It is most often seen as angiokeratoma of Fordyce, purple papules on the scrotum or vulva of the elderly, which should not be treated unless they bleed easily. Angiokeratomas can also occur on the hands and feet of children. The condition is not malignant and its cause is unknown. Angiokeratomas may be removed surgically. See also Fabry disease.

angioma n. a benign tumour composed of blood vessels or lymph vessels. Cherry angiomas (or Campbell de Morgan spots) are small red spots on the trunk in middle-aged or elderly people. They are completely harmless and consist of a minor vascular malformation. An arteriovenous angioma (or malformation) is a knot of distended blood vessels overlying and compressing the surface of the brain. It may cause epilepsy, or one of the vessels may burst, causing a *subarachnoid haemorrhage or a haemorrhage within the brain (intracerebral haemorrhage). This type of angioma may be suitable for surgical removal or stereotactic radiotherapy (see stereotactic localization). It may be associated with a purple birthmark on the face: this is called the Sturge–Weber syndrome. Arteriovenous malformations may occur in many other parts of the body, where they are often asymptomatic. See also haemangioma; lymphangioma.

angio-oedema (angioneurotic oedema) n. see urticaria.

angioplasty n. repair or reconstruction of a narrowed or completely obstructed blood vessel. Traditionally, this was performed during open surgery, but in modern practice angioplasty commonly refers to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; balloon angioplasty), in which an inflatable balloon, mounted on the tip of a flexible catheter, is placed within the lumen of the affected vessel at the site of the narrowing/blockage, under X-ray control. On inflation of the balloon the lumen is reopened with varying rates of success. A vascular stent may be required if the results are suboptimal. Common sites for PTA are coronary, carotid, renal, and leg arteries. See also coronary angioplasty.

angioscope n. 1. a modified microscope used to study capillaries. 2. a narrow flexible endoscope used to examine the interior of blood vessels.

angiospasm n. see Raynaud’s disease.

angiotensin n. either of two peptides: angiotensin I or angiotensin II. Angiotensin I is derived, by the action of the enzyme *renin, from a protein (alpha globulin) secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. As blood passes through the lungs, another enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), acts on angiotensin I to form angiotensin II. This peptide causes constriction of blood vessels and stimulates the release of the hormones *vasopressin and *aldosterone, which increase blood pressure. See also ACE inhibitor; angiotensin II antagonist.

angiotensin II antagonist any one of a class of drugs that block the action of the hormone *angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels; they are therefore useful in treating *hypertension. These drugs include candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, telmisartan, and valsartan. Side-effects are usually mild.

angle n. 1. (in anatomy) a corner. For example, the angle of the eye is the outer or inner corner of the eye; the angle of the mouth is the site where the upper and lower lips join on either side. 2. the degree of divergence of two lines or planes that meet each other; the space between two such lines. The carrying angle is the obtuse angle formed between the forearm and the upper arm when the forearm is fully extended and the hand is supinated.

angle of Louis see sternum.

angstrom n. a unit of length equal to one ten millionth of a millimetre (10−10 m). It is not a recommended *SI unit but is sometimes used to express wavelengths and interatomic distances: the *nanometre (1 nm = 10 Å) is now the preferred unit. Symbol Å.

anhedonia n. a reduction in or the total loss of the feeling of pleasure in acts that normally give pleasure.

anhidrosis n. the absence of sweating in the presence of an appropriate stimulus for sweating, such as heat. A reduction in sweating is known as hypohidrosis. Anhidrosis and hypohidrosis may accompany disease or occur as a congenital defect.

anhidrotic 1. n. any drug that inhibits sweating, such as an *antimuscarinic drug. 2. adj. inhibiting sweating.

anhydraemia n. a decrease in the proportion of water, and therefore plasma, in the blood.

anhydramnios n. absence of amniotic fluid (liquor) surrounding the fetus. This can be associated with premature rupture of membranes, placental insufficiency, intrauterine growth restriction, and certain fetal renal abnormalities (e.g. *Potter syndrome).

anhydrase n. an enzyme that catalyses the removal of water from a compound.

anima/animus n. see archetype.

anion n. an ion of negative charge, such as a bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) or a chloride ion (Cl−) (See also electrolyte). The anion gap is the difference between the concentrations of cations (positively charged ions) and anions, calculated from the formula:



It is used to estimate the unaccounted-for anions in the blood in cases of metabolic disturbance. The normal anion gap is 12–16 mmol/l.

aniridia n. congenital absence of the iris (of the eye). This may be a hereditary condition, associated with macular dysplasia, sensory nystagmus, and congenital cataract. See also WAGR syndrome.

aniseikonia n. a condition in which the image of an object differs markedly in size or shape between the two eyes.

anisocoria n. inequality in the size of the pupils of the two eyes, usually a difference of more than 1 mm in diameter. For diagnosis, it is important to establish which of the pupils is behaving abnormally.

anisocytosis n. an excessive variation in size between individual red blood cells. Anisocytosis is measured by some automatic analysers; these automated instruments calculate the red cell distribution width (RDW), which reflects anisocytosis. Anisocytosis may be a feature of almost any disease affecting the blood.

anisomelia n. a difference in size or shape between the arms or the legs.

anisometropia n. the condition in which the power of *refraction in one eye differs significantly from that in the other.

ankle n. 1. the hinge joint between the leg and the foot. It consists of the *talus (ankle bone), which projects into a socket formed by the lower ends of the *tibia and *fibula. 2. the whole region of the ankle joint, including the *tarsus and the ends of the tibia and fibula.

ankle jerk a deep tendon reflex elicited when the Achilles tendon is stretched and then struck with a tendon hammer. The normal response is reflex contraction of the calf muscles and plantar flexion of the ankle. The ankle jerk may be increased if the spinal cord is compressed above the level of the first sacral spinal nerve (which arises at the level of the second lumbar vertebra). If the nerve itself is cut or compressed the reflex is reduced or absent.

ankyloblepharon n. an abnormal fusion (partial or complete) of the upper and lower eyelid margins.

ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) n. a congenital anomaly in which an unusually short, thick, or tight *fraenum restricts the mobility of the tongue. It is often first noticed in a newborn who has difficulty breastfeeding. No treatment is required unless the condition is extreme, in which case surgical division of the fraenum may be necessary.

ankylosing spondylitis see spondylitis.

ankylosis n. pathological fusion of two bones across a joint space resulting from prolonged joint inflammation or infection. In bony ankylosis the joint space is obliterated by bony tissue as a result of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as ankylosing *spondylitis *psoriatic arthritis, *rheumatoid arthritis, or *septic arthritis. Fibrous ankylosis, in which there is a shortening of the connecting fibrous tissue, results from healing with fibrosis and is commonly associated with chronic arthritis due to tuberculous infection.

Ankylostoma n. see Ancylostoma.

annulus n. (in anatomy) a circular opening or ring-shaped structure. —annular adj.

anodontia n. the absence of all primary and/or permanent teeth because they have failed to develop. It is more common for only a few teeth to fail to develop (see hypodontia; oligodontia).

anodyne n. any treatment or drug that soothes and eases pain.

anogenital warts see condyloma; wart.

anomaloscope n. an instrument for testing colour discrimination. By adjusting the controls the subject has to produce a mixture of red and green light to match a yellow light. The matching is done on a brightly illuminated disc viewed down a telescope.

anomalous pulmonary venous drainage a congenital abnormality in which the pulmonary veins enter the right atrium or vena cava instead of draining into the left atrium. The clinical features are those of an *atrial septal defect.

anomaly n. any deviation from the normal, especially a congenital or developmental defect.

anomia n. a form of *aphasia in which the patient is unable to give the names of objects, although retaining an understanding of their use and the ability to put words together into speech. It sometimes occurs after a stroke or in certain types of dementia.

anonychia n. congenital absence of one or more nails.

Anopheles n. a genus of widely distributed mosquitoes, occurring in tropical and temperate regions, with some 350 species. The malarial parasite (see Plasmodium) is transmitted to humans solely through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. Some species of Anopheles may transmit the parasites of bancroftian *filariasis.

anophthalmos n. congenital absence of the eye.

anoplasty n. a surgical technique used to repair a weak or injured anal sphincter.

anorchism n. congenital absence of one or both testes.

anorexia n. loss of appetite.

anorexia nervosa a psychiatric illness in which the patients starve themselves or use other techniques, such as vomiting or taking laxatives, to induce weight loss. To fulfil ICD-10 criteria for anorexia nervosa a patient must have a distorted body image (thinking they are overweight when they are not), a defined weight loss or *body mass index reduction, amenorrhoea, and vomiting or purging. The illness is most common in female adolescents, but about 10% of sufferers are male. There is a significant mortality associated with anorexia nervosa because of the medical consequences of weight loss. The causes of the illness are not clearly understood: problems within the family, rejection of adult sexuality, self-harming behaviour in the context of an *emotionally unstable personality disorder, and performance pressure are hypothesized as factors involved. Patients must be persuaded to eat enough to maintain a normal body weight and their emotional disturbance is usually treated with *psychotherapy supported by a dietician and possibly the *community mental health team. See also bulimia.

anosmia n. absence of the sense of smell. This can be temporary, as with a cold or other forms of *rhinitis, or it can be permanent, following certain viral infections, head injuries, and tumours affecting the *olfactory nerve. If loss of the sense of smell is partial rather than total, the condition is called hyposmia.

anosognosia n. failure to be aware of one’s disability, often resulting from right hemisphere brain damage. It is seen with a range of deficits, including *hemiplegia and *hemispatial neglect. A striking example is Anton’s syndrome, in which patients believe they can see normally despite being completely blind following severe bilateral damage to the visual cortex.

anovulation n. failure of the ovary to develop and release a female germ cell (ovum). Anovular menstruation is uterine bleeding in the absence of ovulation.

anoxaemia n. a condition in which there is less than the normal concentration of oxygen in the blood. See also anoxia; hypoxaemia.

anoxia n. a condition in which the tissues of the body receive inadequate amounts of oxygen. This may result from low atmospheric pressure at high altitudes; a shortage of circulating blood, red blood cells, or haemoglobin; or disordered blood flow, such as occurs in heart failure. It can also result from insufficient oxygen reaching the blood in the lungs due to poor breathing movements or because disease, such as pneumonia, is reducing the effective surface area of lung tissue. See also hypoxia. —anoxic adj.

ANP atrial *natriuretic peptide.

ansa n. (in anatomy) a loop; for example, the ansa hypoglossi is the loop formed by the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve.

ansiform adj. (in anatomy) shaped like a loop. The term is applied to certain lobules of the cerebellum.

ant- (anti-) prefix denoting opposed to; counteracting; relieving. Examples: antarthritic (relieving arthritis); antibacterial (destroying or stopping the growth of bacteria).

Antabuse n. see disulfiram.

antacid n. a drug that neutralizes the hydrochloric acid secreted in the digestive juices of the stomach. Antacids, which include aluminium and magnesium compounds, are used to relieve pain and discomfort in disorders of the digestive system, including peptic ulcer.

antagonist n. 1. a muscle whose action (contraction) opposes that of another muscle (called the agonist or prime mover). Antagonists relax to allow the agonists to effect movement. 2. a drug or other substance with opposite action to that of another drug or natural body chemical, which it inhibits. Examples are the *antimetabolites. —antagonism n.

antazoline n. a short-acting *antihistamine drug, applied topically in combination with the sympathomimetic drug *xylometazoline to treat allergic conjunctivitis.

antegrade adj. along the direction of the flow of (blood or urine), e.g. antegrade arterial access, antegrade *urethrography. Compare retrograde.

ante mortem before death. Compare post mortem.

antenatal diagnosis see prenatal diagnosis.

antepartum adj. occurring before the onset of labour.

antepartum haemorrhage (APH) bleeding from the genital tract after the 20th week of pregnancy until the birth of the baby. Dangerous causes include *abruptio placentae and *placenta praevia.

anterior adj. 1. describing or relating to the front (ventral) portion of the body or limbs. 2. describing the front part of any organ. For example, the anterior chamber of the eye is that part of the eye between the cornea and the lens, which is filled with aqueous humour.

anteroposterior (AP) adj. from the front to the back. In radiography, AP denotes a radiograph in the *coronal plane taken when the X-ray beam is directed from the front to the back of the patient with the X-ray film or detector at the back to capture the image. Compare decubitus; posteroanterior.

anteversion n. the forward inclination of an organ, especially the normal forward inclination of the uterus. Compare retroversion.

anthelmintic 1. n. any drug or chemical agent used to destroy parasitic worms (helminths), e.g. tapeworms, roundworms, and flukes, and/or remove them from the body. Anthelmintics include *albendazole, *mebendazole, *niclosamide, and *praziquantel. 2. adj. having the power to destroy or eliminate helminths.

anthracosis n. see coal-worker’s pneumoconiosis.

anthracycline n. any of 500 or so antibiotics synthesized or isolated from species of Streptomyces. *Doxorubicin is the most important member of this group of compounds, which have wide activity, particularly against breast cancer and lymphoma; others include *daunorubicin and epirubicin. See cytotoxic drug.

anthrax n. an acute infectious disease of farm animals caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which can be transmitted to humans by contact with animal hair, hides, or excrement. In humans the disease attacks either the lungs, causing pneumonia, or the skin, producing severe ulceration (known as malignant pustule). Woolsorter’s disease is a serious infection of the skin or lungs by B. anthracis, affecting those handling wool or pelts (see occupational disease). Untreated anthrax can be fatal but administration of large doses of penicillin or tetracycline is usually effective.

anthrop- (anthropo-) combining form denoting the human race. Examples: anthropogenesis or anthropogeny (origin and development of); anthropoid (resembling); anthropology (science of).

anthropometry n. the taking of measurements of the human body or its parts. Comparisons can then be made between individuals of different sexes, ages, and races to determine the difference between normal and abnormal development. —anthropometric adj.

anthropozoonosis n. a disease that is transmissible from an animal to a human, or vice versa, under natural conditions. Diseases that are found primarily in animals and sometimes affect humans include *leptospirosis, *anthrax, and *rabies.

anti-androgen n. any one of a group of drugs that inhibit the action of testosterone on the prostate gland by blocking androgen receptors, competing for binding sites, or decreasing androgen production. They are therefore used in the treatment of prostate cancer, which is an androgen-dependent tumour. Anti-androgens include *abiraterone acetate, *bicalutamide, *cyproterone, *finasteride, and *flutamide.

anti-arrhythmic adj. describing a group of drugs used to correct irregularities in the heartbeat (see arrhythmia). They include *adenosine, *amiodarone, *verapamil, *disopyramide, *flecainide, and *lidocaine.

antibacterial adj. describing an antibiotic that is active against bacteria.

antibiotic n. a substance, produced by or derived from a microorganism, that destroys or inhibits the growth of other microorganisms. Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by organisms that are sensitive to them, usually bacteria or fungi. They may alter the normal microbial content of the body (e.g. in the intestine, lungs, bladder) by destroying one or more groups of harmless or beneficial organisms, which may result in infections (such as thrush in women) due to overgrowth of resistant organisms. These side-effects are most likely to occur with broad-spectrum antibiotics (those active against a wide variety of organisms). Resistance may also develop in the microorganisms being treated; for example, through incorrect dosage or overprescription (see also superinfection). Antibiotics should not be used to treat minor infections, which will clear up unaided. Some antibiotics may cause allergic reactions. There is now a rising concern that many infectious organisms have developed resistance to the commonly used antibiotics, and that the world is in danger of running out of effective new pharmaceutical agents to take their place. See also aminoglycosides; antifungal; antiviral drug; cephalosporin; penicillin; quinolone; tetracyclines.

antibody n. a special kind of blood protein that is synthesized in lymphoid tissue in response to the presence of a particular *antigen and circulates in the plasma to attack the antigen and render it harmless. The production of specific antibodies against antigens as diverse as invading bacteria, inhaled pollen grains, and foreign red blood cells is the basis of both *immunity and *allergy. Chemically, antibodies are proteins of the globulin type; they are classified according to their structure and function (see immunoglobulin).

anticardiolipin antibodies autoantibodies that are directed against phospholipid-binding plasma proteins found in *antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is characterized by venous and arterial thrombosis and recurrent miscarriages.

anticholinergic adj. see antimuscarinic.

anticholinesterase n. any substance that inhibits the action of *cholinesterase, the enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and therefore allows acetylcholine to continue transmitting nerve impulses. Drugs with anticholinesterase activity include *neostigmine, *pyridostigmine, and *edrophonium; their uses include the diagnosis and treatment of *myasthenia gravis. See also parasympathomimetic.

anticoagulant n. an agent that prevents the clotting of blood. The natural anticoagulant *heparin directly interferes with blood clotting and is active both within the body and against a sample of blood in a test tube. Synthetic drugs, such as *warfarin, are effective only within the body, since they act by affecting blood coagulation factors (see blood coagulation). They take longer to act than heparin. Anticoagulants are used to prevent the formation of blood clots or to break up clots in blood vessels in such conditions as thrombosis and embolism. Incorrect dosage may result in haemorrhage (see INR). See also direct oral anticoagulant; fibrinolytic.

anticonvulsant n. a drug that prevents or reduces the severity and frequency of seizures in various types of epilepsy; the term antiepileptic drug is now preferred since not all epileptic seizures involve convulsions. The choice of drug is dictated by the type of seizure and the patient’s response, and the dosage must be adjusted carefully as individuals vary in their response to these drugs and side-effects may be troublesome. Commonly used antiepileptic drugs include *carbamazepine, *lamotrigine, *phenytoin, *sodium valproate, levetiracetem, topiramate, *gabapentin, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine. Phenobarbital is no longer commonly prescribed.

Certain anticonvulsants have shown efficacy in treating bipolar disorder and chronic pain, as in postherpetic neuralgia or *peripheral neuropathy, and can be used to prevent migraine and other primary headache syndromes.

antidepressant n. a drug designed to alleviate the symptoms of *depression. Most antidepressants act by altering the availability of *serotonin and *noradrenaline in the brain; they are also likely to influence synaptic transmission regulation and postsynaptic conduction. There are four main classes of antidepressants. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram (see SSRI), are recommended as first-line treatment for depression and anxiety by current NICE guidelines. Their mode of action is entirely on serotonin. Side-effects include gastrointestinal problems and nausea. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as *imipramine, *doxepin, *lofepramine, *clomipramine, and *amitriptyline, are also widely used. They act on noradrenaline as well as serotonin, although most of them primarily have a noradrenergic action. They are also used in chronic pain management. Their side-effect profile varies from that of SSRIs; on the whole they have more *antimuscarinic effects and are more sedative. They are more dangerous in overdose than SSRIs and cause more weight gain. Other side-effects include postural hypotension. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), such as venlafaxine and duloxetine (see SNRI), are a common second-line choice in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as the reversible moclobemide and the irreversible phenelzine (see MAO inhibitor), are older antidepressants. They are now less used because of significant side-effects and interactions with other drugs. The irreversible MAOIs also require certain dietary restrictions. Antidepressants are not addictive, but depending on their half-life they show a varying prevalence of *discontinuation syndrome. Antidepressants have consistently been shown to be more effective than placebo. Their efficacy is lower in mild depression but moderate to good in moderate and severe depression. They are part of the gold-standard treatment for depression and anxiety.

antidiabetic drugs drugs used to control *diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is treated with the wide range of formulations of *insulin. Type 2 diabetes is treated mainly with *oral hypoglycaemic drugs but in some cases insulin may be required.

anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D Ig) a preparation of anti-D, a *rhesus factor antibody formed by Rh-negative individuals following exposure to Rh-positive blood (usually by exchange between fetal and maternal blood in Rh-negative women who carry a Rh-positive fetus). Anti-D Ig is administered (by intramuscular injection) to Rh-negative women within 72 hours of giving birth to a Rh-positive child (or following miscarriage or abortion) to prevent the risk of *haemolytic disease of the newborn in a subsequent child. It rapidly destroys any remaining Rh-positive cells, which could otherwise stimulate antibody production affecting the next pregnancy. Anti-D is also available as antenatal prophylaxis to all Rh-negative pregnant women.

antidiuretic hormone (ADH) see vasopressin.

antidote n. a drug that counteracts the effects of a poison or of overdosage by another drug. Examples are *desferrioxamine and *edetate.

antidromic adj. describing impulses travelling ‘the wrong way’ in a nerve fibre. This is rare but may happen in shingles, when the irritation caused by the virus in the spinal canal initiates impulses that travel outwards in normally afferent nerves. The area of skin that the sensory nerves supply (usually a strip on the trunk) becomes painfully blistered. Antidromic impulses cannot pass *synapses, which work in one direction only.

antiemetic n. a drug that prevents vomiting. Various drugs have this effect, including some *antihistamines (e.g. cyclizine, promethazine) and *antimuscarinic drugs. They are used for such conditions as motion sickness and vertigo; drugs used to counteract nausea and vomiting due to other causes (e.g. cytotoxic drugs) include *domperidone, *metoclopramide, and *ondansetron.

antiepileptic drug see anticonvulsant.

antifibrinolytic adj. describing an agent that inhibits the dissolution of blood clots (see fibrinolysis). Antifibrinolytic drugs include *tranexamic acid.

antifungal (antimycotic) adj. describing a drug that kills or inactivates fungi and is used to treat fungal (including yeast) infections. Antifungal drugs include *amphotericin, *griseofulvin, the *imidazoles, *itraconazole, *nystatin, and *terbinafine.

antigen n. any substance that may be specifically bound by an *antibody molecule. In order to generate antibodies specific for small molecules, the latter are attached to a larger molecule before immunization. The small molecule is called a hapten; the larger molecule is called a carrier. —antigenic adj.

antigen-presenting cell (APC) a cell, such as a *dendritic cell or a *macrophage, that processes antigen for presentation to a T lymphocytes (see helper T cell).

antihelix (anthelix) n. the curved inner ridge of the *pinna of the ear.

antihistamine n. a drug that inhibits the action of *histamine by blocking specific histamine receptors. Four histamine receptors have been identified (H1 to H4). H1-receptor antagonists are used for symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, such as hay fever, pruritus (itching), and urticaria (nettle rash). Many H1-receptor antagonists, e.g. *cyclizine and *promethazine, also have a strong *antiemetic activity and are used to prevent motion sickness. The most common side-effect of these drugs, especially the older antihistamines (e.g. *alimemazine, promethazine), is drowsiness and because of this they are sometimes used for sedation. Newer antihistamines, e.g. cetirizine, loratidine, mizolastine, are less sedating. Other side-effects include dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, digestive upsets, and lack of muscular coordination.

H2 receptors are mainly found in the stomach, where stimulation by histamine causes secretion of acid gastric juice. H2-receptor antagonists (e.g. *cimetidine, *nizatidine, *ranitidine, and *famotidine) block these receptors and reduce gastric acid secretion; they are used in the treatment of functional dyspepsia, *peptic ulcers, and *gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. H3- and H4-receptor antagonists have yet to find a clinical role.

antihypertensive drugs drugs used in treating high blood pressure (see hypertension).

anti-inflammatory 1. adj. describing a drug that reduces *inflammation. The various groups of anti-inflammatory drugs act against one or more of the mediators that initiate or maintain inflammation. Some groups suppress only certain aspects of the inflammatory response. The main groups of anti-inflammatory drugs are the *antihistamines, the glucocorticoids (see corticosteroid), and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see NSAID). 2. n. an anti-inflammatory drug.

antiketogenic n. an agent that prevents formation of *ketones in the body.

antilymphocyte serum (antilymphocyte globulin, ALS, ALG) an *antiserum, containing antibodies that suppress lymphocytic activity, prepared by injecting an animal with lymphocytes. ALS may be given to a patient to prevent the immune reaction that causes tissue rejection following transplantation of such organs as kidneys or of bone marrow. Administration naturally also impairs other immunity mechanisms, making infection a serious hazard.

antimetabolite n. any one of a group of drugs that interfere with the normal metabolic processes within cells by combining with the enzymes responsible for them. Some drugs used in the treatment of cancer, e.g. *cytarabine *fluorouracil, *methotrexate, and *mercaptopurine, are antimetabolites that prevent cell growth by interfering with enzyme reactions essential for nucleic acid synthesis. For example, fluorouracil inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. Side-effects of antimetabolites can include blood cell disorders and digestive disturbances. See also chemotherapy; cytotoxic drug.

antimitotic n. any one of a group of drugs that inhibit cell division and growth, e.g. *doxorubicin. The drugs used to treat cancer are mainly antimitotics. See also antimetabolite; cytotoxic drug.

anti-Müllerian hormone see Müllerian duct.

antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) adj. inhibiting the action of *acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that conveys information in the parasympathetic nervous system. Antimuscarinic drugs block the effects of certain (muscarinic) receptors (hence their name). The actions of these drugs include relaxation of smooth muscle, decreased secretion of saliva, sweat, and digestive juices, and dilation of the pupil of the eye. *Atropine and similar drugs have these effects; they are used in the treatment of gut spasms (e.g. *propantheline) and of parkinsonism (e.g. *trihexyphenidyl) as bronchodilators (e.g. *ipratropium), and as *mydriatics. Characteristic side-effects include dry mouth, thirst, blurred vision, dry skin, increased heart rate, and difficulty in urination.

antimutagen n. a substance that can either reduce the spontaneous production of mutations or prevent or reverse the action of a *mutagen.

antimycotic adj. see antifungal.

antinuclear antibody (ANA) an autoantibody directed against nuclear membranes, found in systemic *lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as *Sjögren’s syndrome, *scleroderma, and inflammatory *myositis.

The different types of ANAs are defined by their target antigen and different profiles have been correlated with clinical features.

anti-oestrogen (oestrogen-receptor antagonist) n. one of a group of drugs that oppose the action of oestrogen by binding to *oestrogen receptors in the body’s tissues. The most important of these drugs is currently *tamoxifen, which is used in the treatment of breast cancers dependent on oestrogen. Because they stimulate the production of pituitary *gonadotrophins, some anti-oestrogens (e.g. *clomifene, tamoxifen) are used to induce or stimulate ovulation in infertility treatment. Side-effects of anti-oestrogens include hot flushes, itching of the vulva, nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and sometimes vaginal bleeding.

antioxidant n. a substance capable of neutralizing oxygen free radicals – the highly active and damaging atoms and chemical groups produced by normal metabolic processes, by various disease processes, and by poisons, radiation, smoking, and other agencies. Antioxidants occur naturally in the body and in certain foods and beverages; they may also be ingested in the form of supplements. They include *vitamin C (ascorbic acid), *vitamin E (tocopherols), and β-*carotene. See also phytochemical.

antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS, Hughes syndrome) an autoimmune disease in which the presence of antibodies against phospholipid (see anticardiolipin antibodies; lupus anticoagulant) is associated with a tendency to arterial or venous thrombosis and, in women of childbearing age, to recurrent miscarriage. APS may be primary or occur in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other connective-tissue diseases. Treatment is by low-dose aspirin or heparin.

antiplatelet drug any one of a class of drugs that reduce platelet aggregation (see platelet activation) and therefore the formation of clot (see thrombosis). Examples are *abciximab, *aspirin, *clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor.

antipruritic n. an agent that relieves itching (*pruritus). Examples are *doxepin and *crotamiton, applied in creams or lotions, and some *antihistamine drugs (e.g. *alimemazine), used if the itching is due to an allergy.

antipsychotic n. any one of a group of drugs used to treat severe mental disorders (psychoses), including schizophrenia and mania; some are administered in small doses to relieve anxiety and tic disorders or to treat impulsivity in *emotionally unstable personality disorder. Formerly called major tranquillizers, and later typical and atypical antipsychotics, they are now known as first- and second-generation antipsychotics. The first-generation (or typical) antipsychotics include the *phenothiazines (e.g. *chlorpromazine), *butyrophenones (e.g. *haloperidol), and thioxanthenes (e.g. *flupentixol). Side-effects of antipsychotic drugs can include *extrapyramidal effects, sedation, *antimuscarinic effects, weight gain, and *long QT syndrome. The second-generation (or atypical) antipsychotics are a group of more recently developed drugs that are in theory associated with fewer extrapyramidal effects than first-generation antipsychotics: they include *clozapine, *risperidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antipsychotics act on various neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, including dopamine, histamine, serotonin, and cholinergic receptors. Most of them block neurotransmitter activity, but some have partially agonistic effects. Recent evidence suggests that there are significant differences among the second-generation antipsychotics regarding their efficacy and side-effect profiles. Clozapine, amisulpride, and olanzapine were found to be the most effective antipsychotics. Clozapine, zotepine, and olanzapine caused the most weight gain; haloperidol, zotepine, and chlorpromazine caused the most extrapyramidal side-effects; sertindole, amisulpride, and ziprasidone caused the most QT-prolongation; and clozapine, zotepine, and chlorpromazine caused the most sedation.

antipyretic n. a drug that reduces fever by lowering the body temperature. Several analgesic drugs have antipyretic activity, including *aspirin and *paracetamol.

antiretroviral drug (ARV) any of a group of drugs that inhibit or slow the growth of *retroviruses, specifically HIV, and are used in the treatment of HIV infection and *AIDS. They include the *reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the *protease inhibitors (see also maraviroc; raltegravir). Treatment with a combination of antiretrovirals is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

antisecretory drug any drug that reduces the normal rate of secretion of a body fluid, usually one that reduces acid secretion into the stomach. Such drugs include *antimuscarinic drugs, H2-receptor antagonists (see antihistamine), and *proton-pump inhibitors.

antisepsis n. the elimination of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms that cause disease by the use of chemical or physical methods.

antiseptic n. a chemical that destroys or inhibits the growth of disease-causing bacteria and other microorganisms and is sufficiently nontoxic to be applied to the skin or mucous membranes to cleanse wounds and prevent infections or to be used internally to treat infections of the intestine and bladder. Examples are *cetrimide, *chlorhexidine, and povidone-*iodine.

antiserum n. (pl. antisera) a serum that contains antibodies against antigens of a particular kind; it may be injected to treat, or give temporary protection (passive *immunity) against, specific diseases. Antisera are prepared in large quantities in such animals as horses. In the laboratory, they are used to identify unknown organisms responsible for infection (see agglutination).

antisocial personality disorder a *personality disorder characterized by callous unconcern for others, irresponsibility, violence, disregard for social rules, and an incapacity for maintaining enduring relationships. It is also known as dyssocial personality in ICD-10, psychopathy, and sociopathy.

antitussive (cough suppressant) n. a drug, such as *pholcodine (a weak opioid), that suppresses coughing, possibly by reducing the activity of the cough centre in the brain and by depressing respiration. Some opioid analgesics also have antitussive activity, e.g. *codeine, *diamorphine, and *methadone.

anti-VEGF an agent that inhibits the action of *vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). See angiogenesis inhibitor.

antivenene (antivenin) n. an *antiserum containing antibodies against specific poisons in the venom of such an animal as a snake, spider, or scorpion.

antiviral drug a drug effective against viruses that cause disease. Antiviral drugs include *DNA polymerase inhibitors (e.g. *aciclovir, *foscarnet, *ganciclovir), *ribavirin, and *oseltamivir; they are used for treating herpes, cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections, and influenza. Antiviral drugs are also used for treating HIV infection and AIDS (see antiretroviral drug).

Anton’s syndrome see anosognosia. [G. Anton (1858–1933), Austrian neurologist]

antrectomy n. 1. surgical removal of the bony walls of an *antrum. See antrostomy. 2. (distal gastrectomy) a surgical operation in which the gastric antrum is removed.

anvil n. (in anatomy) see incus.

anxiety n. generalized pervasive *fear. Anxiety disorders are conditions in which anxiety dominates the patient’s life or is experienced in particular situations; they include *panic disorder, *post-traumatic stress disorder, and *generalized anxiety disorder. Symptoms include excessive worrying, disproportional fears, and a variety of physical symptoms. Treatment usually includes antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy, and anxiety management techniques.

anxiety management a *behaviour therapy designed to allow patients who suffer from anxiety disorders to reduce their symptoms by learning how to achieve states of relaxation and deal with excessive *rumination about anxiety-provoking thoughts.

anxiolytic adj. describing a group of drugs used for the short-term treatment of anxiety of various causes. Formerly known as minor tranquillizers, they include the *benzodiazepines and *buspirone. Common side-effects of these drugs are drowsiness and dizziness, and prolonged use may result in *dependence.

A-O Association for Osteosynthesis: denoting a widely used system for treating fractures by metal inserts.

aorta n. (pl. aortae or aortas) the main artery of the body, from which all others derive. It arises from the left ventricle (ascending aorta), arches over the top of the heart (see aortic arch) and descends in front of the backbone (descending aorta), giving off large and small branches and finally dividing to form the right and left *iliac arteries. The part of the descending aorta from the aortic arch to the diaphragm is called the thoracic aorta; the part below the diaphragm is the abdominal aorta. —aortic adj.

aortic aneurysm see aneurysm.

aortic arch that part of the aorta that extends from the ascending aorta, upward over the heart and then backward and down as far as the fourth thoracic vertebra. *Stretch receptors in its outer wall monitor blood pressure and form part of the system maintaining this at a constant level.

aortic regurgitation a leak of the aortic valve resulting in reflux of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. Aortic regurgitation is most commonly due to degenerative ‘wear and tear’ of the aortic valve. Other causes include dilatation of the aortic root with secondary dilatation of the aortic valve, scarring of the aortic valve as a result of previous acute rheumatic fever, or destruction of the valve by infection (see endocarditis). Mild cases are symptom-free, but patients more severely affected develop breathlessness, angina pectoris, and enlargement of the heart; all have a diastolic murmur. A badly affected valve may be replaced surgically with a prosthesis.

aortic replacement a surgical technique used to replace a diseased length of aorta, most often the abdominal aorta. It usually involves inserting into the aorta a flexible tube of artificial material, which functions as a substitute for the diseased section.

aortic stenosis narrowing of the opening of the aortic valve due to fusion of the cusps that comprise the valve. It may result from previous rheumatic fever, or from calcification and scarring in a valve that has two *cusps instead of the normal three, or it may be congenital. Aortic stenosis obstructs the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta during systole. Breathlessness on effort, angina pectoris, and fainting may follow. The patient has a systolic *murmur. When symptoms develop the valve should be replaced with a mechanical or biological prosthesis, either surgically or via a catheter (see transcatheter aortic valve implantation).

aortic valve a valve in the heart, lying between the left ventricle and the aorta. It is a *semilunar valve that prevents blood returning to the ventricle from the aorta.

aortitis n. inflammation of the aorta, which was previously common as a late complication of syphilis but is more often now associated with a variety of poorly understood autoimmune conditions (such as *Behçet’s syndrome and *Takayasu’s disease). Inflammation of the aortic wall may result in the formation of an aneurysm or vascular stenosis, obstructing blood flow to target organs. Chest pain may occur from pressure on surrounding structures or from the reduced blood supply to the heart. *Aortic regurgitation may be found. Surgical repair to the aortic aneurysm or valve may be needed.

aortocaval compression (supine hypotension) compression of the aorta and inferior vena cava by a pelvic mass, such as the pregnant uterus, causing maternal hypotension when the woman adopts the supine position. The blood pressure usually returns to normal when the woman is turned onto a left lateral tilt.

aortography n. imaging of the aorta. In the traditional method a series of X-ray images were taken during the injection of X-ray dye into the aorta via a catheter. This technique has been largely replaced as a primary investigation by other *cross-sectional imaging methods, such as CT aortography and MR aortography.

AP see anteroposterior.

APACHE scoring system acute physiological and chronic health evaluation: a tool used to assess the severity of illness in a critically ill patient and to estimate mortality. The assessment uses information from 12 physiological measurements, including temperature, blood pressure, arterial pH, and certain blood results.

apathetic hyperthyroidism a condition seen in older patients with *thyrotoxicosis, characterized by weight loss, slow atrial fibrillation, and severe depressive illness, rather than the usual florid symptoms. They have small goitres on examination and the blood tests confirm thyrotoxicosis, which is treated in the standard manner.

apathy n. an individual’s lack of interest in or concern for matters that might be expected to affect him or her significantly. A sign of impaired motivation, it is associated with *depression.

APC see antigen-presenting cell.

APD 1. see auditory processing disorder. 2. automated *peritoneal dialysis.

aperient n. a mild *laxative.

Apert syndrome a hereditary disorder characterized by *craniosynostosis, underdevelopment of the midfacial tissues resulting in a sunken facial appearance, and *syndactyly (fusion) of 2–5 digits (‘mitten glove’). Variable mental deficits and cleft palate may result. The condition may be associated with *Crouzon syndrome, in which case the fusion of the digits is less marked. See also acrocephalosyndactyly. [E. Apert (1868–1940), French physician]

apex n. the tip or summit of an organ; for example the heart or lung. The apex of a *tooth is the tip of the root, where there is a small hole (the apical foramen) through which vessels and nerves pass from the pulp to the periapical tissues. —apical adj.

apex beat the impact of the heart against the chest wall during *systole. It can be felt to the left of the breastbone, in the space between the fifth and sixth ribs.

apexification n. a method of inducing a hard-tissue barrier at the apex of an immature tooth following traumatic injury that has caused the pulp to die.

apexogenesis n. a pulp-therapy procedure performed to encourage development and formation of the root end when an immature tooth has sustained injury following trauma but without pulp necrosis.

Apgar score a method of rapidly assessing the general state of a baby immediately after birth. A score of 0, 1, or 2 points is given for each sign, usually measured at one minute and five minutes after delivery (see table). Thus an infant scoring a total of 10 points would be in optimum condition. When the score is low, the test is repeated at intervals as a guide to short-term progress. [V. Apgar (1909–74), US anaesthetist]





aphagia n. inability to swallow. Compare dysphagia.

aphakia n. absence of the lens of the eye: the state of the eye after a cataract has been removed when no intraocular lens has been inserted. —aphakic adj.

aphasia (dysphasia) n. a disorder of language affecting the generation and content of speech and its understanding (it is not a disorder of articulation: see dysarthria). It is caused by damage to the language-dominant half of the brain, which is usually the left hemisphere in a right-handed person. In expressive aphasia there is difficulty in producing language; in receptive aphasia there is difficulty with the comprehension of the spoken word. Aphasia is commonly accompanied by difficulties in reading and writing. —aphasic adj.

aphonia n. absence or loss of the voice caused by disease of the larynx or mouth or by disease of the nerves and muscles involved in the generation and articulation of speech. If loss of speech is due to a language defect in the cerebral hemispheres, the disorder is *aphasia.

aphrodisiac n. an agent that stimulates sexual excitement.

aphthous ulcer a small ulcer, occurring singly or in groups in the mouth as white or red spots; their cause is unknown. Treatment is with topical tetracycline or topical corticosteroids.

apical abscess an infection in the bone around the apex of a tooth. An acute abscess is extremely painful and if left untreated may cause swelling of the jaw and sometimes the face. A chronic abscess may be completely asymptomatic. An abscess invariably results from damage to and infection of the pulp of the tooth. Treatment is drainage and *root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth; antibiotics may give temporary relief. If left untreated, the infection may spread, resulting in severe complications and even mortality.

apicectomy n. (in dentistry) surgical removal of the apex of the root of a tooth, also referred to as retrograde root canal treatment, root resection, or root-end resection. The root end cavity is prepared and filled with a biocompatible material. The procedure is carried out when *root canal treatment has failed and cannot be redone.

aplasia n. total or partial failure of development of an organ or tissue. See also agenesis. —aplastic adj.

apnoea n. temporary cessation of breathing from any cause, formally defined as a reduction in nasal airflow to less than 30% of normal for more than 10 seconds. The presence of more than five episodes of apnoea per hour of sleep is indicative of *obstructive sleep apnoea. Attacks of apnoea are common in newborn babies and should be taken seriously although they do not necessarily indicate serious illness. See also sleep apnoea. —apnoeic adj.

apnoea monitor an electronic alarm that is activated by a sensor that responds to a baby’s respiratory movements. It can be used at home to monitor babies thought to be at risk of *sudden infant death syndrome.

apocrine adj. 1. describing sweat glands that occur only in hairy parts of the body, especially the armpit and groin. These glands develop in the hair follicles and appear after puberty has been reached. The strong odours associated with sweating result from the action of bacteria on the sweat produced by apocrine glands. Compare eccrine. 2. describing a type of gland that loses part of its protoplasm when secreting. See secretion.

apolipoprotein n. any one of a family of proteins that form the protein components of *lipoproteins, which transport hydrophobic lipid molecules in the plasma. Individual members of the family are designated by the abbreviation ‘Apo’ followed by a capital letter. Apolipoproteins have a range of molecular weights and perform a variety of functions during the life cycle of the lipoproteins in which they are found. These include acting as ligands for the binding of enzymes (ApoB) and as cofactors for the action of other enzymes (ApoA and ApoC).

apomorphine n. a *dopamine receptor agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease that is poorly controlled by *levodopa. Side-effects include involuntary movements and instability of posture.

apophysis n. 1. a protuberance of bone to which a tendon is attached. It ossifies separately from the rest of the bone and fuses with it at maturity. 2. a projection of any other part, e.g. of the brain (apophysis cerebri: the *pineal gland).

apophysitis n. inflammation of an unfused *apophysis resulting from excessive traction from a large tendon attachment. It most commonly occurs around the knee (see Osgood-Schlatter disease) and the heel (see Sever’s disease). See also osteochondritis.

apoplexy n. see stroke.

apoptosis n. programmed cell death, which results in the ordered removal of cells and occurs naturally as part of the normal development, maintenance, and renewal of cells, tissues, and organs. During embryonic development, for example, the fingers are ‘sculpted’ from the embryonic spade-like hand by apoptosis of the cells between them. Defects in apoptosis, for example if it is absent or blocked, have been implicated in the uncontrolled division of malignant cells that occurs in cancer. Abnormal apoptosis, due to failure of the mechanisms that control it, may be a causative factor in autoimmune disease.

appendectomy n. the usual US term for *appendicectomy.

appendicectomy n. surgical removal of the vermiform appendix. See also appendicitis.

appendicitis n. inflammation of the vermiform *appendix. The typical presentation of acute appendicitis is central abdominal pain, which later migrates to the right lower abdomen; other symptoms include malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and even diarrhoea. Palpation of the abdomen may reveal tenderness overlying the inflamed appendix (see McBurney’s point). Unusual positions of the appendix may cause pain in different sites, leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Acute appendicitis is a surgical emergency requiring removal of the appendix (appendicectomy). Failure to do so may lead to abscess formation, perforation, peritonitis, life-threatening sepsis, and circulatory shock. Conditions that mimic appendicitis include mesenteric *lymphadenitis, terminal ileitis (see Crohn’s disease), right-sided ectopic pregnancy, a right-sided kidney stone, *pyelonephritis, and (rarely) right-sided pneumonia.

apple-core adj. describing the characteristic radiographic appearance of a *stricture of the large bowel resulting from the presence of a cancer, observed in a double-contrast barium enema study. The bowel is narrow with an irregular outline and the ends of the stricture are ‘shouldered’, giving the appearance of an apple core after eating the fleshy portion of the fruit. This contrasts with smooth tapering strictures, which are commonly benign.

applicator n. any device used to apply medication or treatment to a particular part of the body.

apposition n. the state of two structures, such as parts of the body, being in close contact. For example, the fingers are brought into apposition when the fist is clenched, and the eyelids when the eyes are closed.

For doctors, the content of the appraisal is based on the General Medical Council’s document Good Medical Practice. See also clinical governance.

apraclonidine n. an alpha agonist (see sympathomimetic) administered to reduce or prevent raised intraocular pressure, especially after laser surgery.

apraxia n. an inability to make skilled movements with accuracy. This is a disorder of the *cerebral cortex resulting in the patient’s inability to organize the movements rather than clumsiness due to weakness, sensory loss, or disease of the *cerebellum. It is most often caused by disease of the dominant *parietal lobe of the brain and sometimes by disease of the frontal lobe, causing, for example, difficulty in walking (gait apraxia).

aprepitant n. an antiemetic drug used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea. It blocks activation of neurokinin–1 receptors in the vomiting centres of the brain by substance P, a peptide released by chemotherapy.

arachnodactyly n. abnormally long and slender fingers: usually associated with excessive height and congenital defects of the heart and eyes in *Marfan’s syndrome.

arachnoid (arachnoid mater) n. the middle of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (see meninges), which has a fine, almost cobweb-like, texture. Between it and the pia mater within lies the subarachnoid space, containing cerebrospinal fluid and large blood vessels; the membrane itself has no blood supply.

arachnoiditis n. an inflammatory process causing thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the membranous linings (*meninges) of the spinal canal. The resulting entrapment of nerve roots may result in weakness, pain, and numbness in the affected area. The condition may result from infection or inflammation of the meninges, surgery, or as a response to the oil-based dyes previously used in *myelography. The reaction to myelography is prevented by the current use of water-soluble dyes.

arachnoid villus one of the thin-walled projections outwards of the arachnoid membrane into the blood-filled sinuses of the dura, acting as a one-way valve for the flow of cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid space into the bloodstream. Large villi, known as arachnoid granulations (or Pacchionian bodies), are found in the region of the superior sagittal sinus. They may be so distended as to cause pitting of the adjacent bone.

arbor n. (in anatomy) a treelike structure. Arbor vitae is the treelike outline of white matter seen in sections of the cerebellum; it also refers to the treelike appearance of the inner folds of the cervix (neck) of the uterus.

arbovirus n. one of a group of RNA-containing viruses that are transmitted from animals to humans by insects (i.e. arthropods; hence arthropod-borne viruses) and cause diseases resulting in encephalitis or serious fever, such as dengue and yellow fever.

ARC AIDS-related complex: see AIDS.

arc-eye n. a painful condition of the eyes caused by damage to the surface of the cornea by ultraviolet light from arc welding. It usually resolves if the eyes are padded for 24 hours. It is similar to *snow blindness and the condition caused by overexposure of the eye to sun-tanning lamps.

arch- (arche-, archi-, archo-) combining form denoting first; primitive; ancestral. Example: archinephron (first-formed embryonic kidney).

archetype n. (in Jungian psychology) an inherited idea or mode of thought supposed to be present in the *unconscious mind and to derive from the experience of the whole human race (the collective unconscious), not from the life experience of the individual. Anima is the feminine component of a male’s personality; animus is the masculine component of a female’s personality.

archipallium n. the *hippocampal formation of the cerebrum. The term is seldom used.

arcuate keratotomy a curved incision made in the periphery of the cornea. It is usually performed in the region of greatest curvature of the cornea in order to flatten it and hence reduce *astigmatism.

arcuate uterus an anomaly or anatomical variation in which there is a slight indentation of the endometrium at the top of the uterus. Unlike a septate uterus, in which the indentation extends into a septum that divides the interior of the uterus, and a *bicornuate uterus, it does not normally affect reproductive function. See also uterus didelphys.

arcus n. an arch; for example the arcus aortae (*aortic arch) or an arcus senilis or arcus juvenilis (see corneal arcus).

ARDS see adult respiratory distress syndrome.

argon plasma coagulation an endoscopic procedure used predominantly to control bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. secondary to angiodysplasia and bleeding following polypectomy. Occasionally it is used in the debulking of tumours not amenable to surgery. An intermittent stream of argon gas is delivered through a catheter in the endoscope and ionized by a monopolar electrical current producing a controlled release of thermal energy. This causes coagulation in the adjacent tissues.

Argyll Robertson pupil a disorder of the eyes in which the *pupillary reflex is absent. Although the pupils contract normally for near vision (the accommodation reflex), they fail to contract in bright light. It may occur, for example, as a result of syphilis or diabetes. [D. Argyll Robertson (1837–1909), Scottish ophthalmologist]

argyria (argyrosis) n. the deposition of silver in the skin and other tissues, either resulting from industrial exposure or following ingestion or long-term administration of silver salts. A slate-grey pigmentation develops slowly; this is accentuated in areas exposed to light. Deposition of silver in the conjunctiva, corneal epithelium, stroma, and Descemet’s membrane is usually due to chronic exposure to silver compounds or instillation of eye drops containing silver.

It is associated commonly with *neural tube defects, *hydrocephalus, and a *syringomyelia. [J. Arnold (1835–1915) and H. Chiari (1851–1916), German pathologists]

Aromasin n. see aromatase inhibitor.

aromatase inhibitor any one of a class of drugs used in the treatment of early and advanced oestrogen-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. These drugs act by inhibiting the action of aromatase, an enzyme that promotes the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol. They therefore reduce oestrogen levels, which can be helpful in the control of oestrogen-dependent tumours. Aromatase inhibitors include anastrazole, exemestane, and letrozole. Side-effects include symptoms of oestrogen deficiency (e.g. hot flushes), nausea and vomiting, and headache.

aromatherapy n. a form of complementary medicine that utilizes fragrant essential oils to improve physical, psychological, and emotional wellbeing. The oils can be massaged into the skin or their fragrances can be inhaled via an infusion.

arousal n. 1. a state of alertness and of high responsiveness to stimuli. It is produced by strong motivation, by anxiety, and by a stimulating environment. 2. physiological activation of the *cerebral cortex by centres lower in the brain, such as the *reticular activating system, resulting in wakefulness and alertness.

arrhenoblastoma n. see androblastoma.

arrhythmia n. any deviation from the normal rhythm (sinus rhythm) of the heart. Arrhythmias result from a disturbance of the generation or the conduction of electrical impulses from the *sinoatrial node and may be intermittent or continuous. They are subdivided into tachyarrhythmias (fast rate) and bradyarrhythmias (slow rate). They include *ectopic beats (extrasystoles), *re-entry tachycardia, ectopic tachycardias (see supraventricular tachycardia; ventricular tachycardia), atrial and ventricular *fibrillation, and *heart block (which is often associated with slow heart rates). Symptoms include palpitations, breathlessness, and chest pain. In more serious arrhythmias the *Stokes-Adams syndrome or *cardiac arrest may occur. Arrhythmias may result from most heart diseases but they also occur without apparent cause.

arsenic n. a poisonous greyish metallic element producing the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cramps, convulsions, and coma when ingested in large doses. Drugs used as antidotes to arsenic poisoning include *chelating agents. Arsenic was formerly readily available in the form of rat poison and in fly-papers and was the poisoner’s first choice during the 19th century, its presence in a body being then difficult to detect. Today detection is relatively simple. Arsenic was formerly used in medicine, the most important arsenical drugs being arsphenamine (Salvarsan) and neoarsphenamine, used in the treatment of syphilis and dangerous parasitic diseases. Symbol: As.

artefact n. see artifact.

artemisinin n. the active ingredient of qinghaosu, a Chinese herbal medicine prepared from a species of wormwood (Artemisia annua) and long used for treating malaria. Derivatives of artemisinin (including artesunate and artemether) have been developed for the treatment of malignant (falciparum) malaria; they act by killing the asexual stages of the parasite (see Plasmodium) and are used in combination with other antimalarial drugs. In the UK, for example, artemether is available in combination with lumefantrine.

arter- (arteri-, arterio-) combining form denoting an artery. Examples: arteriopathy (disease of); arteriorrhaphy (suture of); arteriovenous (relating to arteries and veins).

arterial line a narrow *catheter inserted into an artery for the purposes of continuous monitoring or blood gas analysis. It is used for short periods during phases of acute or critical illness and should be clearly labelled to prevent inadvertent use as a medication conduit. The femoral, axillary, or posterior tibial arteries can be used as insertion sites.

Arterial line.





arterial ulcer a localized area of damage and breakdown of the skin due to inadequate arterial blood supply (*ischaemia). Usually it is seen on the feet of patients with severe atheromatous narrowings of the arteries supplying the legs.

arteriectomy n. surgical excision of an artery or part of an artery. This may be performed as a diagnostic procedure (for example, to take an arterial biopsy in the diagnosis of arteritis) or during reconstruction of a blocked artery when the blocked segment is replaced by a synthetic graft.

arteriogenesis n. the enlargement of pre-existing collateral channels to form collateral arteries in order to bypass an occluded primary artery (see collateral circulation). This is an active process involving remodelling of the vessel wall mediated by cellular and chemical signals.

arteriography n. imaging of arteries (see angiography). The major roles of arteriography are to demonstrate the site and extent of atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion, especially in the coronary arteries (see coronary angiography) and leg arteries (peripheral arteriography), and to demonstrate the anatomy of aneurysms within the skull (carotid and vertebral arteriography). This technique is also used to image a bleeding vessel prior to blocking it (see embolization).

arteriole n. a small branch of an *artery, leading into many smaller vessels – the *capillaries. By their constriction and dilation, under the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, arterioles are the principal controllers of blood flow and pressure.

arteriolitis n. inflammation of the arterioles (the smallest arteries), which may complicate severe hypertension. This produces necrotizing arteriolitis, which may result in kidney failure. A similar condition may affect the lung in pulmonary hypertension.

arteriolosclerosis n. see nephrosclerosis.

arterioplasty n. surgical reconstruction of an artery; for example, in the treatment of *aneurysms.

arterioportography (arterial portography) n. an invasive imaging technique used to visualize the *portal vein. A diagnostic catheter is advanced to the superior mesenteric artery or splenic artery from the common femoral artery or radial artery. X-ray contrast is injected and images are taken as this passes through the artery and returns via the veins, to opacify the portal vein. The images obtained will show the portal vein on fluoroscopy. When it is combined with CT scanning (CT arterioportography), exquisite details of the portal vein and the liver will be obtained. As the liver is mainly supplied by the portal vein, this technique enhances the contrast of the normal liver and shows any abnormal areas very clearly. Tumours not seen on conventional CT scans are readily visible.

arteriosclerosis n. an imprecise term used for any of several conditions affecting the arteries. The term is often used as a synonym for atherosclerosis (see atheroma).

arteriotomy n. an incision into, or a needle puncture of, the wall of an artery. This is most often performed as a diagnostic procedure in the course of *arteriography or cardiac *catheterization. It may also be required to remove an embolus (see embolectomy).

arteriovenous anastomosis a thick-walled blood vessel that connects an arteriole directly with a venule, thus bypassing the capillaries. Arteriovenous anastomoses are commonly found in the skin of the lips, nose, ears, hands and feet; their muscular walls can constrict to reduce blood flow or dilate to allow blood through to these areas.

arteriovenous aneurysm a direct communication between an artery and vein, without an intervening capillary bed. It can occur as a congenital abnormality or it may be acquired following injury or surgery. It may affect the limbs, lungs, or viscera and may be single or multiple. If the connection is large, the short-circuiting of blood may produce heart failure. Large isolated arteriovenous aneurysms may be closed surgically.

arteriovenous malformation see angioma.

arteritis n. an inflammatory disease that affects the muscular walls of the arteries. It may be part of a *connective-tissue disease or it may be due to an infection, such as syphilis. The affected vessels are swollen and tender and may become blocked. Temporal (or giant-cell) arteritis occurs in the elderly and most commonly affects the arteries of the scalp. The patient complains of severe headache, and double vision or scalp tenderness may be present; blindness may result from thrombosis of the arteries to the eyes. Treatment with steroid medication is rapidly effective.

artery n. a blood vessel carrying blood away from the heart. All arteries except the *pulmonary artery carry oxygenated blood. The walls of arteries contain smooth muscle fibres, which contract or relax under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. See illustrations. See also aorta; arteriole.

Transverse section through an artery.





The principal arteries of the body.





arthr- (arthro-) combining form denoting a joint. Examples: arthrology (science of); arthrosclerosis (stiffening or hardening of).

arthralgia (arthrodynia) n. severe ache or pain in a joint, without swelling or other signs of arthritis. Compare arthritis.

arthrectomy n. surgical excision of a joint. It is usually performed on a painful joint that has ceased to function, as may result from intractable infection, or after a failed joint replacement. See also arthroplasty.

arthritis n. inflammation of one or more joints, characterized by pain, swelling, warmth, redness of the overlying skin, and diminished range of joint motion. There are four basic subgroups of arthritis: noninflammatory arthritis, including *osteoarthritis, *neuropathic arthritis, and *osteochondritis dissecans; inflammatory arthritis, including *rheumatoid arthritis, *gout, *psoriatic arthritis, and *juvenile idiopathic arthritis; infectious arthritis, including *septic arthritis; and haemorrhagic arthritis, including haemophilic arthritis (which occurs in patients with haemophilia). Arthritis may be monoarticular (involving one joint), pauciarticular (involving four or fewer joints), or polyarticular (involving five or more joints, either simultaneously or in sequence). Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings, including X-rays, blood tests, and where necessary analysis of synovial fluid obtained by *arthrocentesis. Treatment is specific for each subgroup and may include any combination of supportive measures with activity modification, analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. *NSAIDs), *disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids, and surgical procedures, such as joint replacement (see arthroplasty). —arthritic adj.

arthrocentesis n. aspiration (removal) of fluid from a joint through a puncture needle into a syringe.

arthrodesis n. artificial ankylosis: the fusion of bones across a joint space by surgical means, in order to eliminate movement. This operation is performed when a joint is very painful, highly unstable, grossly deformed or chronically infected, or when an *arthroplasty would be inadvisable or impossible. See also Charnley clamps.

arthrodic joint (gliding joint) a form of *diarthrosis (freely movable joint) in which the bony surfaces slide over each other without angular or rotational movement. Examples are the joints of the carpus and tarsus.

arthrodynia n. see arthralgia.

arthrography n. an imaging technique for examining joints. A contrast medium (either *radiolucent gas or a *radiopaque material) is injected into the joint space, outlining its contents and extent accurately. Conventional arthrography has now largely been replaced by magnetic resonance arthrography (MR arthrography; see magnetic resonance imaging).

arthrogryposis n. congenital limitation of joint movement due to *contractures affecting two or more joints. This is accompanied by joint stiffness, cylindrical limbs, and absence of skin creases. The most common of such syndromes is arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a congenital condition of multiple contractures in which muscles are replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in narrow limbs. Treatment, which begins soon after birth, consists initially of manipulation and splintage of deformed joints followed by contracture release and osteotomies.

arthropathy n. any disease or disorder involving a joint.

arthroplasty n. surgical refashioning of a diseased joint to relieve pain and to maintain or regain movement. An excision (or resection) arthroplasty involves the excision of enough bone to create a gap at which movement can occur. In an interposition arthroplasty a biological or artificial barrier is placed between the two bony surfaces. In a total arthroplasty both joint surfaces are replaced by *prostheses; in a hemiarthroplasty, performed for some fractures of the hip and shoulder, only one end of a joint is replaced.

arthropod n. any member of a large group of animals that possess a hard external skeleton and jointed legs and other appendages. Many arthropods are of medical importance, including the *mites, *ticks, and *insects.

arthroscope n. a rigid telescope fitted with a lens system and fibreoptic illumination that is inserted into a joint through a small (‘keyhole’) incision and generates a magnified picture of the joint interior that can be viewed on a television monitor. The diameter of arthroscopes ranges from 2 mm for small joints to 5 mm for larger joints.

arthroscopy n. inspection of a joint cavity with an *arthroscope, enabling percutaneous surgery (such as *meniscectomy) and *biopsy to be performed.

arthrostomy n. a procedure to enable a temporary opening to be made into a joint cavity.

arthrotomy n. the surgical opening of any joint. It is performed to allow joint inspection, removal of a loose body, drainage of pus (from an infected joint) or of a haematoma, synovectomy, joint reconstruction, or joint replacement.

articaine n. an amide-type local *anaesthetic used in dentistry. With a lower pKa of 7.8 (more rapid onset) and high lipid solubility (depth of anaesthesia), it is of significant benefit when infection is present. It also has the ability to penetrate bone. Although a causal relationship has not been proven, articaine has been associated with a higher risk of nerve damage when used as a block technique.

articular adj. relating to a joint. For example, articular cartilage is the layer of cartilage at the ends of adjoining bones at a joint. See also extra-articular; intra-articular; periarticular.

articulation n. (in anatomy) the point or type of contact between two bones. See joint.

articulator n. (in dentistry) an apparatus for relating the upper and lower models of a patient’s dentition in a fixed position, usually with maximum tooth contact. Some articulators can reproduce jaw movements. They are used in the construction of crowns, bridges, and dentures.

artifact (artefact) n. 1. (in radiography) an appearance on an image that is not a true representation of the patient’s body part. The cause may be a problem with the radiographic technique or something more straightforward. For example, a movement artifact is blurring of the image due to movement of the patient or organ during the exposure. All imaging techniques, including CT and MRI, are susceptible to a range of artifacts. See also partial volume artifact. 2. (in microscopy) a structure seen in a tissue under a microscope that is not present in the living tissue. Artifacts, which are produced by faulty *fixation or staining of the tissue, may give a false impression that disease or abnormality is present in the tissue when it is not.

artificial heart see ventricular assist device.

artificial insemination instrumental introduction of semen into the vagina in order that a woman may conceive. Insemination is timed to coincide with the day on which the woman is expected to ovulate (see menstrual cycle). The semen specimen may be provided by the husband (AIH – artificial insemination husband), for example in cases of erectile dysfunction, or by an anonymous donor (DI – donor insemination), usually in cases where the husband is sterile.

artificial nutrition and hydration the use of enteral feeding tubes or cannulas to administer nutrients and fluids directly into the gastrointestinal tract or bloodstream when the oral route cannot be used owing to disability or disease. When other intensive treatments are judged *futile, artificial nutrition and hydration are considered *extraordinary means of prolonging life in patients who have no prospect of recovery. It is permissible to withdraw such treatment when it is no longer in the patient’s interests and when the primary intention is not to kill the patient, although death is foreseen (see doctrine of double effect). In cases of patients in a *persistent vegetative state in England and Wales, the matter must be referred to the courts following the case of Tony Bland. Where food and water are withdrawn it is still considered important to moisten the patient’s lips and to keep him or her comfortable until death.

artificial respiration (artificial ventilation) an emergency procedure for maintaining a flow of air into and out of a patient’s lungs when the natural breathing reflexes are absent or insufficient. This may occur after drowning, poisoning, etc., or during a surgical operation on the thorax or abdomen when muscle-relaxing drugs are administered. The simplest and most efficient method is *mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In hospital the breathing cycle is maintained by means of a *ventilator.

artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) see amniotomy.

artificial sphincter an apparatus designed to replace or support a *sphincter that is either absent or ineffective. See also neosphincter.

ARV see antiretroviral drug.

arytenoidectomy n. surgical excision of the arytenoid cartilage of the larynx in the treatment of paralysis of the vocal folds.

ASA classification a widely used classification for grading patients’ fitness for surgery prior to the operation. It was developed by the American Society of Anesthesia (ASA), but is now used worldwide. Patients are assigned grades between 1 and 6.

asbestosis n. a lung disease – a form of *pneumoconiosis – caused by fibres of asbestos inhaled by those who are exposed to the mineral. The incidence of lung cancer is high in such patients, particularly if they smoke cigarettes (see also mesothelioma). Asbestosis does not include *asbestos-related pleural disease. This is important because patients with asbestosis due to occupational exposure can often claim compensation, whereas this is only rarely possible for those with asbestos-related pleural disease.

asbestos-related pleural disease any one of a variety of conditions involving the *pleura, but not the lungs (see asbestosis), in subjects exposed to asbestos. These include the formation of pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and pleural effusions (see oedema).

A-scan n. examination of ocular tissue, including measurement of the length of the eye (axial length), by means of a high-frequency ultrasound machine. See also B-scan.

ascariasis n. a disease caused by an infestation with the parasitic worm *Ascaris lumbricoides. Adult worms in the intestine can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, appendicitis, and peritonitis; in large numbers they may cause obstruction of the intestine. The presence of the migrating larvae in the lungs can provoke pneumonia. Ascariasis occurs principally in areas of poor sanitation; it is treated with *levamisole.

Ascaris n. a genus of parasitic nematode worms. A. lumbricoides, widely distributed throughout the world, is the largest of the human intestinal nematodes – an adult female measures up to 35 cm in length. Eggs, passed out in the stools, may be transmitted to a new host in contaminated food or drink. Larvae hatch out in the intestine and then undergo a complicated migration, via the hepatic portal vein, liver, heart, lungs, windpipe, and pharynx, before returning to the intestine where they later develop into adult worms (see also ascariasis).

ascites (hydroperitoneum) n. the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, causing abdominal swelling. Causes include infections (such as tuberculosis), heart failure, *portal hypertension, *cirrhosis, and various cancers (particularly of the ovary and liver): the presence of malignant cells in the fluid, revealed by cytological examination, is usually evidence of secondary spread. Obstruction to the drainage of lymph from the abdomen results in chylous ascites (see chyle). Pancreatic ascites, due to direct communication between the pancreatic duct and the peritoneal cavity, usually following trauma or severe pancreatitis, is diagnosed by very high amylase levels in aspirated ascitic fluid. Treatment includes diuretics and ascitic drainage (paracentesis) if there is associated respiratory distress. See also oedema.

ascorbic acid see vitamin C.

ASD see atrial septal defect.

-ase suffix denoting an enzyme. Examples: lactase; dehydrogenase.

asepsis n. the complete absence of bacteria, fungi, viruses, or other microorganisms that could cause disease. Asepsis is the ideal state for the performance of surgical operations and is achieved by using *sterilization techniques. —aseptic adj.

Asherman syndrome a condition in which *amenorrhoea and infertility follow a major haemorrhage in pregnancy. It may result from overvigorous curettage of the uterus in an attempt to control the bleeding. This removes the lining, the walls adhere, and the cavity is obliterated to a greater or lesser degree. Some 50% of such patients are subsequently infertile, and of those who become pregnant, only a minority achieve an uncomplicated delivery. Compare Sheehan’s syndrome. [J. G. Asherman (20th century), Czechoslovakian gynaecologist]

ash-leaf macules impalpable pale spots that may be seen anywhere on the body and are a cutaneous sign of *tuberous sclerosis. Identification is facilitated by examination of the skin with an ultraviolet light source (*Wood’s light).

Askanazy cells see Hürthle cell tumour.

asparaginase n. an enzyme that inhibits the growth of certain tumours. Crisantaspase, the form produced by the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, is used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

asparagine n. see amino acid.

aspartame n. an artificial sweetener (E951) 200 times sweeter than sugar. Aspartame is metabolized by the body into its constituents – aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol – and is therefore not suitable for people with *phenylketonuria. It can be used in diabetic foods.

aspartate aminotransferase (AST) an enzyme involved in the transamination of amino acids. Measurement of AST in the serum may be used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and acute liver disease. It was formerly called serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT).

aspartic acid (aspartate) see amino acid.

Asperger’s syndrome a condition considered to be a mild form of *autism, characterized by social aloofness, a limited range of interests, stilted and pedantic styles of speech, and an excessive preoccupation with a very specialized interest (such as timetables). Intelligence can be normal or enhanced, but is more commonly in the lower average range. [H. Asperger (1906–80), Austrian paediatrician]

aspergillosis n. a group of conditions caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus, usually Aspergillus fumigatus. These conditions nearly always arise in patients with pre-existing lung disease and fall into three categories. The allergic form most commonly affects asthmatic patients and may cause collapse of segments or lobes of a lung. The colonizing form leads to formation of a fungus ball (aspergilloma), usually within a pre-existing cavity in the lung (such as an emphysematous *bulla or a healed tuberculous cavity). Similar fungus balls may be found in other cavities, such as the eye or the sinuses around the nose. The third form of aspergillosis, in which the fungus spreads throughout the lungs and may even disseminate throughout the body, is rare but potentially fatal. It is usually associated with deficiency in the patient’s immunity.

Aspergillus n. a genus of fungi, including many common moulds, some of which cause infections of the respiratory system in humans. The species A. fumigatus causes *aspergillosis. A. niger is commonly found in the external ear and can become pathogenic.

aspermia n. strictly, a lack or failure of formation of semen. More usually, however, the term is used to mean the total absence of sperm from the semen (see azoospermia).

asphyxia n. suffocation: a life-threatening condition in which oxygen is prevented from reaching the tissues by obstruction of or damage to any part of the respiratory system. Drowning, choking, and breathing poisonous gas all lead to asphyxia. Unless the condition is remedied by removing the obstruction (when present) and by artificial respiration if necessary, there is progressive *cyanosis leading to death. Brain cells cannot live for more than about four minutes without oxygen.

aspiration n. the withdrawal of fluid from the body by means of suction using an instrument called an aspirator. There are various types of aspirator: some employ hollow needles for removing fluid from cysts, inflamed joint cavities, etc.; another kind is used to suck debris and water from the patient’s mouth during dental treatment. See also vacuum aspiration.

aspiration cytology the *aspiration of specimens of cells from tumours or cysts through a hollow needle, using a syringe, and their subsequent examination under the microscope after suitable preparation (by staining, etc.). The technique is now used widely, especially for superficial cysts or tumours, and has become a specialized branch of diagnostic pathology. See also fine-needle aspiration cytology.

aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) n. a drug that relieves pain and also reduces inflammation and fever. Largely superseded by modern anti-inflammatory agents (see NSAID), aspirin is now most commonly taken regularly in low doses as an *antiplatelet drug. In this role it reduces the risk of vascular thrombosis that may lead to events such as heart attack or stroke. Aspirin works by inhibiting the production of *prostaglandins; it may irritate the lining of the stomach, causing nausea, vomiting, pain, and bleeding. High doses cause dizziness, disturbed hearing, mental confusion, and overbreathing (see salicylism). Aspirin has been implicated as a cause of *Reye’s syndrome and should therefore not be given to children below the age of 16 years unless specifically indicated by a physician. See also analgesic.

assay n. a test or trial to determine the strength of a solution, the proportion of a compound in a mixture, the potency of a drug, or the purity of a preparation. See also bioassay.

assent n. agreement to undergo medical treatment sought from an adult or child who lacks capacity to *consent. More generally, permission from patients with capacity, but whose autonomy is constrained, given to their doctor to act in their *best interests. Assent has ethical but not legal force. In medical research, particularly with children over seven years, it is difficult to justify proceeding without assent, since research is not principally and inevitably in the patient’s best interests.

assertive outreach team (AOT) a multidisciplinary psychiatric team specialized in the treatment of patients with severe mental illness who are difficult to engage. Most AOTs will only see patients who have had a number of recent hospital admissions (‘revolving door’ patients). Recently, in many areas of the UK AOTs have been subsumed into *community mental health teams.

assimilation n. the process by which food substances are taken into the cells of the body after they have been digested and absorbed.

assisted living a situation in which older adults reside in their own flats or units in a facility where they receive help with tasks of daily living (e.g. bathing, dressing).

assisted suicide the act of helping a patient to commit suicide by giving them the means (e.g. drugs) to do so. Aiding and abetting a suicide is a criminal offence in England and Wales by virtue of the Suicide Act 1961, section 2. Guidance on whether those who assist terminally ill patients in suicide – e.g. by accompanying people to jurisdictions where euthanasia is lawful, such as Switzerland – would be prosecuted for this offence, issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2010, lists 6 ‘public interest factors’ against and 16 in favour of prosecution. Those against include that the person assisted had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to commit suicide and that the person assisting them was wholly motivated by compassion. Those factors in favour of prosecution include that the person assisting was acting in his or her capacity as a medical doctor, nurse, or other caring or custodial professional. For doctors to respect the decision of a patient with capacity to refuse life-saving or life-preserving treatment, however, is not legally regarded as assisted suicide. See also euthanasia.

assistive listening device a device for helping people with hearing difficulties. An assistive listening device can be a stand-alone device or can work in conjunction with a *hearing aid or *cochlear implant. Assistive listening devices include *induction loop systems, amplifiers for telephones, and radio headphones to wear when listening to the radio or television. Such devices increase the loudness of the desired sound without increasing the level of any background noise; i.e. they improve the signal-to-noise ratio. See also environmental hearing aid.

association area an area of *cerebral cortex that lies away from the main areas that are concerned with the reception of sensory impulses and the start of motor impulses but is linked to them by many neurons known as association fibres. The areas of association are thought to be responsible for the elaboration of the information received by the primary sensory areas and its correlation with the information fed in from memory and from other brain areas. They are thus responsible for the maintenance of many higher mental activities. See also body image.

association of ideas (in psychology) linkage of one idea to another in a regular way according to their meaning. In free association the linkage of ideas arising in dreams or fantasy may be used to discover the underlying motives of the individual. In word association tests stimulus words are produced to which the subject has to respond as quickly as possible. See also loosening of associations.

ASSR see auditory steady state response.

AST see aspartate aminotransferase.

astasia-abasia see abasia.

aster n. a star-shaped object in a cell that surrounds the *centrosome during mitosis and meiosis and is concerned with the formation of the *spindle.

astereognosis n. see agnosia.

asteroid hyalosis 1. a degenerative condition, formerly known as asteroid hyalitis, in which tiny deposits of calcium are suspended in the vitreous humour. They are more commonly seen in the elderly and usually cause no decrease in vision. 2. see synchysis scintillans.

asthenia n. weakness or loss of strength.

asthenopia n. see eyestrain.

asthenospermia n. see oligospermia.

asthma n. the condition of subjects with widespread narrowing of the bronchial airways, which changes in severity over short periods of time (either spontaneously or under treatment) and leads to cough, wheezing, and difficulty in breathing. Bronchial asthma may be precipitated by exposure to one or more of a wide range of stimuli, including *allergens, drugs (such as aspirin and other NSAIDs and beta blockers), exertion, emotion, infections, and air pollution. The onset of asthma is usually early in life and in atopic subjects (see atopy) may be accompanied by other manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as hay fever and dermatitis; however, the onset may be delayed into adulthood or even middle or old age. Treatment is with *bronchodilators, with or without corticosteroids, usually administered via aerosol or dry-powder inhalers, or – if the condition is more severe – via a nebulizer. Oral corticosteroids are reserved for those patients who fail to respond adequately to these measures. Severe asthmatic attacks may need large doses of oral corticosteroids (see status asthmaticus). Selection of treatment for individual cases is made using stepped guidelines issued by respiratory organizations, e.g. the British and American Thoracic Societies and the European Respiratory Society. A new group of drug treatments, using *monoclonal antibodies to target components in the allergic response, have recently become available (see omalizumab). Avoidance of known allergens, especially the house dust mite, allergens arising from domestic pets, and food additives, will help to reduce the frequency of attacks, as will the discouragement of smoking.

Cardiac asthma occurs in left ventricular heart failure and must be distinguished from bronchial asthma, as the treatment is quite different. —asthmatic adj.

astigmatism n. a defect of vision in which the image of an object is distorted because not all the light rays come to a focus on the retina. Some parts of the object may be in focus but light from other parts may be focused in front of or behind the retina. This is usually due to irregular curvature of the cornea and/or lens (see refraction), whose surface resembles part of the surface of an egg (rather than a sphere). The defect can be corrected by wearing cylindrical lenses (or cylinders), which produce exactly the opposite degree of distortion and thus cancel out the distortion caused by the eye itself. —astigmatic adj.

astragalus n. see talus.

astringent n. a drug that causes cells to shrink by precipitating proteins from their surfaces. Astringents are used in lotions to harden and protect the skin and to reduce bleeding from minor abrasions. They are also used in mouth washes, throat lozenges, eye drops, etc., and in antiperspirants.

astrocyte (astroglial cell) n. a type of cell with numerous sheet-like processes extending from its cell body, found throughout the central nervous system. It is one of the several different types of cell that make up the *glia. The cells have been ascribed the function of providing nutrients for neurons and possibly of taking part in information storage processes.

astrocytoma n. a brain tumour derived from non-nervous cells (*glia), which – unlike the neurons – retain the ability to reproduce themselves by mitosis. All grades of malignancy occur, from slow-growing tumours whose histological structure resembles normal glial cells, to rapidly growing highly invasive tumours whose cell structure is poorly differentiated (including anaplastic astrocytoma and *glioblastoma). In adults astrocytomas are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres but in children they also occur in the cerebellum.

asymbolia n. see alexia.

asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) see hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

asymmetric tonic neck reflex a primitive reflex that is present from birth but should disappear by six months of age. If the infant is lying on its back and the head is turned to one side, the arm and leg on the side to which the head is turned should straighten, and the arm and leg on the opposite side should bend (the ‘fencer’ position). Persistence of the reflex beyond six months is suggestive of *cerebral palsy.

asymptomatic adj. not showing any symptoms of disease, whether disease is present or not.

asynclitism n. tilting of the fetal skull towards one or other shoulder causing the top of the skull to be either nearer to the sacrum (anterior asynclitism or Naegele’s obliquity) or nearer to the pubis (posterior asynclitism or Litzmann’s obliquity). These mechanisms enable the fetal head to pass more easily through the maternal pelvis.

asystole n. a condition in which the heart no longer beats, accompanied by the absence of complexes in the *electrocardiogram. The clinical features, causes, and treatment are those of *cardiac arrest.

atavism n. the phenomenon in which an individual has a character or disease known to have occurred in a remote ancestor but not in his parents.

ataxia n. the shaky movements and unsteady gait that result from the brain’s failure to regulate the body’s posture and the strength and direction of limb movements. In cerebellar ataxia, due to disease of the *cerebellum, there is clumsiness of willed movements. The patient staggers when walking; he or she cannot pronounce words properly and may have *nystagmus. The common causes are alcohol, drugs (e.g. phenytoin), multiple sclerosis, hereditary degenerative conditions, and *paraneoplastic syndromes. Friedreich’s ataxia is an inherited disorder appearing first in adolescence. It has the features of cerebellar ataxia, together with spasticity of the limbs. The unsteady movements of sensory ataxia, caused by disease of the sensory nerves, are exaggerated when the patient closes his eyes (see Romberg’s sign). See also ataxia telangiectasia; tabes dorsalis. —ataxic adj.

ataxia telangiectasia an inherited (autosomal *recessive) neurological disorder. *Ataxia is usually noted early in life, and a key feature is the presence of dilated blood vessels visible in the sclerae of the eyes and on the cheeks and ears. Other symptoms may include slow slurred speech, abnormal eye movements, skin lesions, and immune deficiency. Affected individuals may develop malignant disease. A raised level of *alpha-fetoprotein is found in the blood.

atel- (atelo-) combining form denoting imperfect or incomplete development. Examples: atelencephaly (of the brain); atelocardia (of the heart).

atelectasis n. failure of part of the lung to expand. This occurs when the cells lining the air sacs (alveoli) are too immature, as in premature babies, and unable to produce the wetting agent (surfactant) with which the surface tension between the alveolar walls is overcome. It also occurs when the larger bronchial tubes are blocked from within by retained secretions, inhaled foreign bodies, or bronchial cancers, or from without by enlarged lymph nodes, such as are found in patients with tuberculosis and lung cancers. The lung can usually be helped to expand by physiotherapy and removal of the internal block (if present) via a *bronchoscope, but prolonged atelectasis becomes irreversible.

ateleiosis n. failure of sexual development owing to lack of pituitary hormones. See infantilism; dwarfism.

atenolol n. a cardioselective *beta blocker used to treat angina, high blood pressure, and irregular heart rhythms. Side-effects are fatigue, depression, and digestive upsets.

atherectomy excision or destruction of *atheroma within an artery using equipment introduced by *catheter. Directional atherectomy involves the use of a device with an incising blade that can be directed to one side of the artery at a time. Rotational atherectomy (rotablation) is achieved with a diamond-tipped drill (burr) that rotates at up to 185,000 times per minute.

atheroembolic renal disease a disease associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and sloughing of atheromatous plaques in the aorta and main renal arteries. This results in occlusion of smaller arteries and arterioles downstream within the kidney, with ischaemic and inflammatory reactions. This leads to the onset of renal impairment. Precipitating factors include invasive procedures with aortic cannulae, vascular surgery, and therapy with thrombolytics or anticoagulants. Less commonly the condition can occur spontaneously.

atheroma n. degeneration of the walls of the arteries due to the formation in them of fatty plaques and scar tissue. This limits blood circulation and predisposes to thrombosis. A diet rich in animal fats (see cholesterol) and refined sugar, cigarette smoking, obesity, and inactivity are the principal causes. Individuals with diabetes, hypertension, or a family history of early atheroma are particularly predisposed to the condition. It may be symptomless but often causes complications from arterial obstruction in middle and late life (such as angina pectoris, heart attack, stroke, and gangrene). Treatment is by prevention, but some symptoms may be ameliorated by drug therapy (e.g. angina by glyceryl trinitrate), by surgical bypass of the arterial obstruction, or by *atherectomy. —atheromatous adj.

atherosclerosis n. a disease of the arteries in which fatty plaques develop on their inner walls, with eventual obstruction of blood flow. See atheroma. —atherosclerotic adj.

athetosis n. a writhing involuntary movement especially affecting the hands, face, and tongue. It is usually a form of *cerebral palsy. It impairs the child’s ability to speak or use his hands; intelligence is often unaffected. Such movements may also be caused by drugs used to treat *parkinsonism or by the phenothiazines (see also dyskinesia). —athetotic adj.

athlete’s foot a fungal infection of the skin between the toes: a type of *ringworm. Medical name: tinea pedis.

athyreosis n. absence of or lack of function of the thyroid gland, causing *cretinism in infancy and *myxoedema in adult life.

atlas n. the first *cervical vertebra, by means of which the skull is articulated to the backbone.

ATLS advanced trauma life support: see advanced life support.

ATN see acute tubular necrosis.

atomoxetine n. a CNS *stimulant used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents. Side-effects include anorexia, dry mouth, gastrointestinal upsets, palpitation, and sleep disturbance, and there is a small risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour.

atony n. a state in which muscles are floppy, lacking their normal elasticity. —atonic adj.

atopen n. any substance responsible for *atopy.

atopy n. a form of *allergy in which there is a hereditary or constitutional tendency to develop hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. hay fever, allergic asthma, atopic *eczema) in response to allergens (atopens). Individuals with this predisposition – and the conditions provoked in them by contact with allergens – are described as atopic.

atorvastatin n. a drug used to reduce abnormally high levels of cholesterol and other lipids in the blood (see statin). Side-effects include insomnia, abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhoea, and nausea.

atosiban n. see tocolytic.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) a compound that contains adenine, ribose, and three phosphate groups and occurs in cells. The chemical bonds of the phosphate groups store energy needed by the cell, for muscle contraction; this energy is released when ATP is split into ADP or AMP. ATP is formed from ADP or AMP using energy produced by the breakdown of carbohydrates or other food substances. See also mitochondrion.

atracurium besilate a nondepolarizing *muscle relaxant administered during anaesthesia or intensive care. Side-effects including flushing and an increase in heart rate.

atresia n. 1. congenital absence or abnormal narrowing of a body opening. See biliary atresia; duodenal atresia; tricuspid atresia. 2. the degenerative process that affects the majority of ovarian follicles. Usually only one Graafian follicle will ovulate in each menstrual cycle. —atretic adj.

atri- (atrio-) combining form denoting an atrium, especially the atrium of the heart. Example: atrioventricular (relating to the atria and ventricles of the heart).

atrial fibrillation see fibrillation.

atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) see natriuretic peptide.

atrial septal defect (ASD) a congenital defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the partition (septum) separating the two atria (see septal defect). There are two kinds of ASD – ostium primum and ostium secundum. Ostium primum defects are rarer but more serious as the defect lies low down near the valves of the heart. Affected children often have heart failure, although in some a heart murmur detected at routine medical examinations is the only indication of the defect. Ostium secundum defects lie away from the valves and most children have no symptoms; the defect is most commonly indicated by the detection of a heart murmur, and may not be apparent until adulthood. Most persisting ostium secundum defects can now be treated with an umbrella-shaped closure device passed to the heart through the venous system under X-ray and ultrasound control. Ostium primum defects still require surgical closure.

Intrauterine surgical techniques now enable a fetus in which an ASD has been detected to proceed to full term by using the placental circulation as a substitute for the *extracorporeal circulation that would otherwise be required.

atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle, bundle of His) a bundle of modified heart muscle fibres (Purkinje fibres) passing from the *atrioventricular node forward to the septum between the ventricles, where it divides into right and left bundles, one for each ventricle. The fibres transmit contraction waves from the atria, via the AV node, to the ventricles.

atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) *re-entry tachycardia arising from the presence of an abnormal electrical connection between atria and ventricles situated within the *atrioventricular node.

atrioventricular node (AV node) a mass of modified heart muscle situated in the lower middle part of the right atrium. It receives the impulse to contract from the *sinoatrial node, via the atria, and transmits it through the *atrioventricular bundle to the ventricles.

atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) *re-entry tachycardia arising from the presence of an abnormal electrical connection between atria and ventricles situated outside the *atrioventricular node. See accessory pathway.

at-risk register see child protection register.

atrium n. (pl. atria) 1. either of the two upper chambers of the *heart. Their muscular walls are thinner than those of the ventricles; the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary vein; the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the venae cavae. See also auricle. 2. any of various anatomical chambers into which one or more cavities open. —atrial adj.

atrophic vaginitis see vaginitis.

atrophy n. the wasting away of a normally developed organ or tissue due to degeneration of cells. This may be physiological or pathological. Physiological atrophy occurs during embryonic life and the neonatal period (web spaces, notochord, umbilical vessels), in adolescence (the thymus), in adult life (the *corpus luteum during the menstrual cycle), and in a variety of organs and tissues in old age. Pathological atrophy may occur through starvation, disuse, denervation, abnormal hormonal stimulation, lack of hormonal stimulation, or ischaemia. Muscular atrophy is associated with various diseases, such as poliomyelitis.

atropine n. an *antimuscarinic drug that occurs in deadly nightshade (see belladonna). Because it dilates the pupil and paralyses the ciliary muscle (see cycloplegia; mydriatic), atropine is used in eye examinations and the treatment of anterior *uveitis. It is also administered by injection to treat a slow heart rate (*bradycardia) associated with arrhythmias or, with *neostigmine, to reverse the action of muscle relaxants used during surgery. It is sometimes used to treat gut spasms and – rarely – for *premedication. Common side-effects include dryness of the throat, thirst, impaired vision, and increased heart rate.

attachment n. 1. (in psychology) the process of developing the first close selective relationship of a child’s life, most commonly with the mother. The relationship acts to reduce anxiety in strange settings and forms a base from which children develop further relationships and explore their environment. Seriously disturbed attachment is hypothesized to lead to personality disorders, depression, or anxiety disorders in later life. 2. (in the National Health Service) working arrangements by which workers employed by public bodies (such as *district nurses and social workers) are engaged in association with specific general practitioners, caring for their registered patients rather than working solely on a geographical or district basis. 3. (clinical attachment) (in the NHS) a person shadowing a clinical professional, often in order to gain experience in that professional’s field or in the UK in general.

attachment disorder a psychiatric disorder in infants and young children resulting from *institutionalization, poor parenting, emotional neglect, or *child abuse. Affected children may be withdrawn or aggressive, and fearful or attention-seeking and indiscriminately friendly. Treatment requires the provision of stable caring adults as parents over a long period of time.

attendance allowance see disability living allowance.

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, attention deficit disorder, hyperkinetic disorder) a developmental disorder characterized by grossly excessive levels of activity and a marked impairment of the ability to attend and concentrate. The behaviour may be predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, predominantly inattentive, or combined. It is hypothesized that the majority of patients have a higher than normal number of dopamine transporter complexes, reducing the amount of freely available dopamine in the synaptic cleft. This leads to cognitive problems, including an inability to keep attention, to focus attention, and to perform organizational planning. Learning is impaired as a result, and behaviour can be disruptive and may be defiant or aggressive. ADHD is highly genetic. It is estimated to affect up to 5% of children; the prevalence is lower in adults because the number of dopamine transporter complexes in the brain naturally declines over time. Untreated, many children later develop *conduct disorder or *personality disorders. Treatment usually involves drugs (such as amphetamines and *methylphenidate) and behaviour therapy; the family needs advice and practical help.

attenuation n. reduction of the disease-producing ability (virulence) of a bacterium or virus by chemical treatment, heating, drying, by growing under adverse conditions, or by passing through another organism. Treated (attenuated) bacteria or viruses are used for many *immunizations.

atticotomy n. a surgical operation to remove *cholesteatoma from the ear. It is a form of limited *mastoidectomy.

attrition n. (in dentistry) non-carious tooth-surface loss caused by tooth-to-tooth contact. A small amount of attrition occurs with age but accelerated wear may occur in *bruxism and with certain diets.

atypical antipsychotics see antipsychotic.

atypical facial pain see persistent idiopathic facial pain.

atypical mole syndrome (dysplastic naevus syndrome) a condition in which patients have numerous moles, some of which are relatively large and irregular in shape or pigmentation. There may be a family history of this syndrome or of malignant *melanoma.

atypical pneumonia any one of a group of community-acquired *pneumonias that do not respond to penicillin but do respond to such antibiotics as tetracycline and erythromycin. They include infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci (see psittacosis), and Coxiella burnetii (see Q fever).

audi- (audio-) combining form denoting hearing or sound.

audiogram n. the graphic record of a test of hearing carried out on an audiometer. The term is also commonly used to refer to types of hearing test. A pure tone audiogram (PTA) is a test that uses tones of a single frequency, played to the test subject through headphones. A free field audiogram uses sounds presented to the patient through loudspeakers. A speech audiogram uses lists of words played to the patient through headphones.

audiology n. the study of disorders of hearing.

audiometer n. an apparatus for testing hearing at different sound frequencies, so helping in the diagnosis of deafness. —audiometry n.

audit n. see clinical audit.

AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tool) an international tool used as an outcome or screening measure for alcohol problems. Developed by the World Health Organization, it consists of 10 questions that review consumption, drinking behaviours, and alcohol-related issues using an interview or a self-report approach. A score of 8 or above suggests hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption; 20 or above suggests alcohol dependence.

auditory adj. relating to the ear or to the sense of hearing.

auditory brainstem implant a device similar to a *cochlear implant except that the electrode stimulates the auditory parts of the *brainstem rather than the cochlea. It is used to restore hearing of profoundly deaf people who have had damage to both auditory nerves and are hence unsuitable for cochlear implantation. It consists of an electrode that is permanently implanted on the surface of the brainstem. An external device with a microphone and an electronic processing unit pass information to the electrode using radio-frequency waves. The implant is powered by batteries in the external part of the device. It is most commonly used in patients with *neurofibromatosis type II who have had bilateral *vestibular schwannomas.

auditory brainstem response audiometry (ABR audiometry, brainstem evoked response audiometry, BSER) an objective test of hearing that measures the electrical activity in the auditory nerve and *brainstem following sound stimulation using repeated clicks or brief tones.

auditory dyssynchrony see auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder.

auditory nerve see cochlear nerve.

auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (auditory neuropathy, auditory dyssynchrony) a form of hearing loss characterized by normal cochlear function as measured by *otoacoustic emissions or detection of *cochlear microphonics but abnormal or absent *middle ear reflexes and abnormal *auditory brainstem responses.

auditory processing disorder (APD, central auditory processing disorder, CAPD) a series of conditions characterized by difficulty in hearing and processing auditory information, especially in poor acoustic environments, despite normal or near-normal ear function. It may be due to genetic factors, maturational delay in the central nervous system, or focal abnormalities of the central nervous system (such as tumours). Treatments include *hearing therapy, *auditory skills training, educational support, use of *assistive listening devices, and training with computerized therapy tools.

auditory skills training a method of teaching people to use their hearing to its best potential, undertaken in the treatment of *auditory processing disorder.

auditory steady state response (ASSR) an objective test of hearing that measures the electrical activity in the auditory nerve and *brainstem following sound stimulation using a modulated continuous tone.

auditory verbal therapy (AVT) a technique for teaching deaf children to communicate that focuses on speech and residual hearing rather than sign language.

Auerbach’s plexus (myenteric plexus) a collection of nerve fibres – fine branches of the *vagus nerve – within the walls of the intestine. It supplies the muscle layers and controls the movements of *peristalsis. [L. Auerbach (1828–97), German anatomist]

AUR acute urinary retention (see retention).

aura n. the forewarning of an epileptic or migrainous attack. An epileptic aura (sometimes known as the preictal phase, because it precedes the main *ictus or seizure) may take many forms, such as an odd smell or taste. The migrainous aura may affect the patient’s eyesight with visual phenomena, such as fortification spectra (zigzag lines) or scotomas (black holes in the visual field), but it may also result in pins and needles, weakness of the limbs, or *aphasia.

aural adj. relating to the ear.

auricle n. 1. a small pouch in the wall of each *atrium of the heart: the term is also used incorrectly as a synonym for *atrium. 2. see pinna.

auriscope (auroscope, otoscope) n. an apparatus for examining the ear canal (external meatus) and eardrum. It consists of a funnel (speculum), a light, and lenses (see illustration).

An auriscope.





auscultation n. the process of listening, usually with the aid of a *stethoscope, to sounds produced by movement of gas or liquid within the body. Auscultation is an aid to diagnosis of abnormalities of the heart, lungs, intestines, and other organs according to the characteristic changes in sound pattern caused by different disease processes. —auscultatory adj.

auscultatory gap a silent period in the knocking sounds heard with a stethoscope over an artery, between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, when the blood pressure is measured with a *sphygmomanometer.

Austin Flint murmur a heart *murmur that is loudest in diastole and associated with a third heart sound. It is a sign of *aortic regurgitation, which allows retrograde filling and rapid rise in left intraventricular pressure. This prevents the mitral valve from opening fully, giving rise to the murmur, which is best heard in the mitral area (apex) rather than the aortic area (where the problem lies). [Austin Flint (1812–86), US physician]

Australia antigen another name for the *hepatitis B antigen, which was first discovered in the blood of an Australian aborigine. This disease is caused by a virus of which the Australia antigen forms part.

aut- (auto-) combining form denoting self. Example: autokinesis (voluntary movement).

autism n. a psychiatric disorder of childhood, with an onset before the age of 2½ years. It is marked by severe difficulties in communicating and forming relationships with other people, in developing language, and in using abstract concepts; repetitive and limited patterns of behaviour (see stereotypy); and obsessive resistance to tiny changes in familiar surroundings. Autistic children find it hard to understand how other people feel, and so tend to remain isolated even into adult life. About 50% have learning disabilities, but some may be gifted in specific areas. The cause is unknown, but genetic factors and brain damage may be important. The condition usually progresses into adulthood, and independent living is uncommon. Treatment is not specific, but lengthy specialized education is usually necessary. Behaviour problems and anxiety can be controlled with behaviour therapy and drugs (such as *antipsychotics). Autism and similar developmental disorders, including *Asperger’s syndrome and *Rett’s syndrome, are known as autistic spectrum disorders. —autistic adj.

autoagglutination n. the clumping together of the body’s own red blood cells by antibodies produced against them, which occurs in acquired haemolytic anaemia (an *autoimmune disease).

autoantibody n. an antibody formed against one of the body’s own components in an *autoimmune disease.

autochthonous adj. 1. remaining at the site of formation. A blood clot that has not been carried in the bloodstream from its point of origin is described as autochthonous. 2. originating in an organ without external stimulus, like the beating of the heart.

autoclave 1. n. a piece of equipment for sterilizing surgical instruments, dressings, etc. It consists of a chamber, similar to a domestic pressure cooker, in which the articles are placed and treated with steam at high pressure. 2. vb. to sterilize in an autoclave.

autocrine adj. describing the production by a cell of substances, such as hormones or *growth factors, that can influence the growth of the cell that produces them.

autofluorescence n. *fluorescence of structures in the absence of fluorescein dye. Structures such as optic disc *drusen fluoresce when stimulated by cobalt blue light.

autogenous adj. originating within the body of the patient. For example, an autogenous vein graft, to bypass a blocked artery, is made from material derived from the body of the patient receiving the graft.

autograft n. a tissue graft taken from one part of the body and transferred to another part of the same individual. The repair of burns is often done by grafting on strips of skin taken from elsewhere on the body, usually the upper arm or thigh. Unlike *allografts, autografts are not rejected by the body’s immunity defences. See also skin graft; transplantation.

autoimmune disease one of a number of otherwise unrelated disorders caused by inflammation and destruction of tissues by the body’s own *immune response. These disorders include acquired haemolytic anaemia, pernicious anaemia, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, Sjögren’s syndrome, and several forms of thyroid dysfunction, including Hashimoto’s disease. It is not known why the body should lose the ability to distinguish between substances that are ‘self’ and those that are ‘non-self’.

autoimmunity n. a disorder of the body’s defence mechanisms in which an *immune response is generated against components or products of its own tissues, treating them as foreign material and attacking them. See autoimmune disease; immunity.

autoinoculation n. the accidental transfer of inoculated material from one site in the body to another. Following vaccination against smallpox, for example, satellite lesions may occur around the site of inoculation. Sometimes the conjunctiva is affected.

autointoxication n. poisoning by a toxin formed within the body.

autologous adj. denoting a graft or transplant that is derived from the recipient of the graft. In dentistry, autologous pulp stem cells are used in the generation of new tissue to replace damaged or defective tissue and autologous bone grafts may be used when placing dental implants.

autolysis n. the destruction of tissues or cells brought about by the actions of their own enzymes. See lysosome.

automated external defibrillator (AED) a type of external *defibrillator that can analyse the heart rhythm it detects and advise via voice prompts on therapy to be given according to the latest guidelines. In cases of ventricular fibrillation, some defibrillators will make decisions on delivering electric shocks and do so after issuing appropriate warnings to the attending health-care professionals.

automated lamellar keratectomy (ALK) excision of the outer layers of the cornea using an automated *keratome. It is usually used as part of a surgical procedure, to alter the shape of the cornea to correct errors of refraction.

automated perimeter see perimeter.

automatism n. behaviour that may be associated with *epilepsy, in which the patient performs well-organized movements or tasks while unaware of doing so. The movements may be simple and repetitive, such as hand clapping and lip smacking, or they may be so complex as to mimic a person’s normal conscious activities.

autonomic nervous system the part of the *peripheral nervous system responsible for the control of involuntary muscles (e.g. the heart, bladder, bowels) and hence those bodily functions that are not consciously directed, including regular beating of the heart, intestinal movements, sweating, salivation, etc. The autonomic system is subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic nerves lead from the middle section of the spinal cord and parasympathetic nerves from the brain and lower spinal cord. The heart, smooth muscles, and most glands receive fibres of both kinds: the interplay of sympathetic and parasympathetic reflex activity (the actions are often antagonistic) governs their working. For example, the parasympathetic system is responsible for slowing the heart rate and constricting the pupillary muscles; the sympathetic system increases the heart rate and dilates the pupil. Sympathetic nerve endings liberate *noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter; parasympathetic nerve endings release *acetylcholine.

autonomy n. literally ‘self-rule’, the capacity for reasoned self-determination in thought and action. Respect for the autonomy of all persons with capacity, particularly patients, is one of the *four principles of medical ethics. In practice, a patient’s capacity to exercise autonomy may be constrained by various circumstances, but in law it is formally safeguarded by the need for valid *consent to treatment or research. Autonomy is not unlimited in its scope, e.g. as a general principle, patients can request but not demand treatment. Professional autonomy involves *reflective practice and attempting to follow one’s own principles consistently and confidently. —autonomous adj.

autophony n. a sensation of being able to hear one’s own voice or breathing unusually loudly. It occurs most commonly in conductive *deafness, more rarely in *patulous Eustachian tube and *superior canal dehiscence syndrome.

autoploidy n. the normal condition in cells or individuals, in which each cell has a chromosome set consisting of *homologous pairs, enabling cells to divide normally. —autoploid adj., n.

autopsy (necropsy, post mortem) n. a review of the clinical history of a deceased person followed by external examination of the body, evisceration and dissection of the internal organs, and ancillary investigations (such as histopathology, microbiology, or toxicology) to determine the cause of death. Autopsies may be performed on the instruction of a medicolegal authority or at the request of clinicians (with consent of the family). In addition to determining the cause of death, autopsies have a role in research, audit, clinical governance, and medical education.

autopulse n. a mechanical device designed to compress the chest (and thereby the heart) rhythmically, with the aim of maintaining the circulation during *cardiac arrest. It is more efficient than manual chest compression and has the advantage of allowing *percutaneous coronary intervention to be performed without interruption of chest compression.

autoradiography (radioautography) n. a technique for examining the distribution of a radioactive *tracer in the tissues of an experimental animal. The tracer is injected into the animal, which is killed after a certain period. Thin sections of its organs are placed in close contact with a radiation-sensitive material, such as a photographic emulsion, and observed under a microscope. Blackening of the film indicates a high concentration of radioactive material.

autorefractor n. a machine that automatically determines the spectacle prescription for the eye. See also optometer.

autosomal dominant see dominant.

autosomal recessive see recessive.

autosome n. any chromosome that is not a *sex chromosome and occurs in pairs in diploid cells. —autosomal adj.

autotransfusion n. reintroduction into a patient of his or her own blood. This may be blood previously drawn and stored in the blood bank or blood that has been lost from the patient’s circulation during surgical operation. The blood is collected by suction during the operation, filtered to remove bubbles and small blood clots, and returned into one of the patient’s veins through a drip. See also cell saver.

autotrophic (lithotrophic) adj. describing organisms (known as autotrophs) that synthesize their organic materials from carbon dioxide and nitrates or ammonium compounds, using an external source of energy. Photoautotrophic organisms, including green plants and some bacteria, derive their energy from sunlight; chemoautotrophic (or chemosynthetic) organisms obtain energy from inorganic chemical reactions. All autotrophic bacteria are nonparasitic. Compare heterotrophic.

aux- (auxo-) combining form denoting increase; growth. Example: auxocardia (enlargement of the heart).

auxiliary n. a person who volunteers to assist and carry out complementary tasks at hospitals or other medical facilities.

auxotroph n. a strain of a microorganism, derived by mutation, that requires one or more specific factors for growth not needed by the parent organism.

avascular adj. lacking blood vessels or having a poor blood supply. The term is usually used with reference to cartilage.

avascular necrosis see osteonecrosis.

Avastin n. see bevacizumab.

aversion therapy a form of *behaviour therapy that is used to reduce the occurrence of undesirable behaviour, such as sexual deviations or drug addiction. *Conditioning is used, with repeated pairing of some unpleasant stimulus with a stimulus related to the undesirable behaviour. An example is the use of *disulfiram in the treatment of alcoholism. Aversion therapy is little used nowadays. See also sensitization.

avian influenza a disease of poultry and other birds caused by strains of *influenza A virus. The severity of the disease depends on the strain of virus involved: H5N1 is particularly deadly (causing fowl plague (or pest), with a mortality approaching 100%) and very contagious, being spread between domestic flocks by wild birds. This virus is not easily transmissible to humans, requiring close contact with infected birds or their faeces. The first human cases of H5N1 infection (‘bird flu’) were reported in 1997 and restricted to Hong Kong: 18 people were infected, six of whom died. Since then half of the people infected with H5N1 in Asia, Europe, the Near East, and Africa have died. Most cases of avian influenza in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry; human-to-human transmission has been extremely rare. However, if H5N1 should develop this ability, a serious pandemic could occur. See also swine influenza.

AVM arteriovenous malformation (see angioma).

AVNRT see atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia.

avoidant adj. describing a *personality disorder characterized by self-consciousness, hypersensitivity to rejection and criticism from others, avoidance of normal situations because of their potential risk, high levels of tension and anxiety, and consequently a restricted life.

AVPU a system for assessing the depth of unconsciousness: A = alert; V = voice responses present; P = pain responses present; U = unresponsive. It is useful for judging the severity of head injury and the need for specialized neurosurgical assistance before proceeding to formal evaluation by the *Glasgow Coma Scale.

AVRT see atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia.

AVT see auditory verbal therapy.

avulsion n. 1. the tearing or forcible separation of part of a structure. For example, a tendon may be torn from the bone to which it attaches or the skin of the scalp may be torn from the underlying tissue and bone. 2. (in dentistry) the complete displacement of a tooth from its socket owing to trauma. The ideal treatment for an avulsed permanent tooth would be *replantation (immediately if possible).

axial adj. at right angles to the long *axis of the body, i.e. denoting a horizontal plane through a standing patient at 90° to the *coronal and *sagittal planes. This is the usual plane for the primary images obtained at *computerized tomography. See also multiplanar reconstruction.

axilla n. (pl. axillae) the armpit. —axillary adj.

axis n. 1. a real or imaginary line through the centre of the body or one of its parts or a line about which the body or a part rotates. 2. the second *cervical vertebra, which articulates with the atlas vertebra above and allows rotational movement of the head.

axolemma n. the fine cell membrane, visible only under the electron microscope, that encloses the protoplasm of an *axon.

axon n. a nerve fibre: a single process extending from the cell body of a *neuron and carrying nerve impulses away from it. An axon may be over a metre in length in certain neurons. In large nerves the axon has a sheath (neurilemma) made of *myelin; this is interrupted at intervals by gaps called nodes of Ranvier, at which branches of the axon leave. An axon ends by dividing into several branches called telodendria, which make contact with other nerves or with muscle or gland membranes.

axonotmesis n. rupture of nerve fibres (axons) within an intact nerve sheath. This may result from prolonged pressure or crushing and it is followed by degeneration of the nerve beyond the point of rupture. The prognosis for *nerve regeneration is good. Compare neurapraxia; neurotmesis.

axoplasm n. the semifluid material of which the *axon of a nerve cell is composed. It flows slowly outwards from the cell body.

azathioprine n. an *immunosuppressant drug, used mainly to aid the survival of organ or tissue transplants. It may also be used in the treatment of severe Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis (see disease-modifying antirheumatic drug), myasthenia gravis, and severe eczema. Azathioprine may damage bone marrow, causing blood disorders; other possible side-effects include nausea and vomiting, malaise, muscle pain, and skin rashes.

azelaic acid an antibacterial drug applied externally as a cream or gel in the treatment of acne and rosacea. Possible side-effects include local irritation and light sensitivity.

azelastine n. an *antihistamine drug administered for the treatment of hay fever and to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Possible side-effects include nasal irritation and disturbances of taste sensation.

azithromycin n. an antibiotic used to treat respiratory, skin, soft-tissue, and other infections, including genital and eye infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Possible side-effects include allergic reactions, nausea, and vomiting.

azo- (azoto-) combining form denoting a nitrogenous compound, such as urea. Example: azothermia (raised temperature due to nitrogenous substances in the blood).

azoospermia (aspermia) n. the complete absence of sperm from the seminal fluid. This is due either to profound impairment of sperm formation (*spermatogenesis) due to damage to the testes (e.g. caused by *cryptorchidism, mumps *orchitis, or radio- or chemotherapy) or – more commonly – to obstruction of the genital tract (e.g. resulting from vasectomy, gonorrhoea, or Chlamydia infection). A biopsy of the testis is necessary in order to differentiate these two causes of azoospermia; if a blockage is present it may be possible to relieve it surgically (see epididymovasostomy).

azotaemia n. a former name for *uraemia.

azoturia n. the presence in the urine of an abnormally high concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds, especially urea.

aztreonam n. an antibiotic administered by injection or inhalation used to treat infections of the lungs, bones, skin, and soft tissues caused by Gram-negative organisms (see Gram’s stain), including lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Possible side-effects include skin rashes, diarrhoea, and vomiting.

azygos vein an unpaired vein that arises from the inferior vena cava and drains into the superior vena cava, returning blood from the thorax and abdominal cavities.

Babinski reflex see plantar reflex. [J. F. F. Babinski (1857–1932), French neurologist]

baby blues (postpartum blues) a colloquial name for the brief episodes of low mood, tearfulness, poor sleep, and irritability that affect up to half of all women during the first week after delivery. Reassurance and support are the mainstay of management. Compare postnatal depression; puerperal psychosis.

bacillaemia n. the presence of bacilli in the blood, resulting from infection.

bacille Calmette–Guérin see BCG. [A. L. C. Calmette (1863–1933) and C. Guérin (1872–1961), French bacteriologists]

bacilluria n. the presence of bacilli in the urine, resulting from a bladder or kidney infection. See cystitis.

bacillus n. (pl. bacilli) any rod-shaped bacterium. See also Bacillus; Lactobacillus; Streptobacillus.

Bacillus n. a large genus of Gram-positive spore-bearing rodlike bacteria. They are widely distributed in soil and air (usually as spores). Most feed on dead organic material and are responsible for food spoilage. The species B. anthracis, which is nonmotile, causes *anthrax, a disease of farm animals transmissible to humans. B. polymyxa, commonly found in soil, is the source of the polymyxin group of antibiotics. B. subtilis may cause conjunctivitis in humans; it is also a source of the antibiotic *bacitracin zinc.

bacitracin zinc an antibiotic effective against a number of microorganisms. Combined with polymyxin B, it is applied externally to treat infections of the skin and eyes.

backbone (spinal column, spine, vertebral column) n. a flexible bony column extending from the base of the skull to the small of the back. It encloses and protects the spinal cord, articulates with the skull (at the atlas), ribs (at the thoracic vertebrae), and hip girdle (at the sacrum), and provides attachment for the muscles of the back. It is made up of individual bones (see vertebra) connected by discs of fibrocartilage (see intervertebral disc) and bound together by ligaments. The backbone of a newborn baby contains 33 vertebrae: seven cervical (neck), 12 thoracic (chest), five lumbar (lower back), five sacral (hip), and four coccygeal. In the adult the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae become fused into two single bones (sacrum and coccyx, respectively); the adult vertebral column therefore contains 26 bones (see illustration). Anatomical name: rachis.

The backbone. Seen from the back (A) and left side (B).





back slaps a manoeuvre for the treatment of a choking patient. Firm slaps are given to the patient’s back in an attempt to dislodge the obstructing article from the upper airway.

baclofen n. a skeletal *muscle relaxant drug administered to relieve spasm resulting from injury or disease of the brain or spinal cord, including cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Side-effects include dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea.

bacteraemia n. the presence of bacteria in the blood: a sign of infection.

bacteri- (bacterio-) combining form denoting bacteria. Example: bacteriolysis (dissolution of).

bacteria pl. n. (sing. bacterium) a group of microorganisms all of which lack a distinct nuclear membrane (and hence are considered more primitive than animal and plant cells) and most of which have a cell wall of unique composition (many antibiotics act by destroying the bacterial cell wall). Most bacteria are unicellular; the cells may be spherical (*coccus), rod-shaped (*bacillus), spiral (*Spirillum), comma-shaped (*Vibrio), or corkscrew-shaped (*spirochaete). Generally, they range in size between 0.5 and 5 μm. Motile species bear one or more fine hairs (flagella) arising from their surface. Many possess an outer slimy *capsule, and some have the ability to produce an encysted or resting form (*endospore). Bacteria reproduce asexually by simple division of cells; incomplete separation of daughter cells leads to the formation of *colonies consisting of different numbers and arrangements of cells. Some colonies are filamentous in shape, resembling those of fungi. Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another takes place in the process of *conjugation.

Bacteria are very widely distributed. Some live in soil, water, or air; others are parasites of humans, animals, and plants. Many parasitic bacteria do not harm their hosts; some cause diseases by producing poisons (see endotoxin; exotoxin).

bacterial vaginosis a condition caused by overgrowth of certain species of the bacteria that are normally present in the vagina (e.g. Bacteroides, *Gardnerella vaginalis). One of the most common vaginal infections, it is marked by a greyish watery vaginal discharge with a characteristic fishy odour. Treatment is with clindamycin or metronidazole.

bactericidal adj. being capable of killing bacteria. Substances with this property include antibiotics, antiseptics, and disinfectants; they are known as bactericides. Compare bacteriostatic.

bacteriology n. the science concerned with the study of bacteria. It is a branch of *microbiology. —bacteriological adj. —bacteriologist n.

bacteriolysin n. see lysin.

bacteriophage (phage) n. a virus that attacks bacteria. In general, a phage consists of a head, tail, and tail fibres, all composed of protein molecules, and a core of DNA. The tail and tail fibres are responsible for attachment to the bacterial surface and for injection of the DNA core into the host cell. The phage grows and replicates in the bacterial cell, which is eventually destroyed with the release of new phages. Each phage acts specifically against a particular species of bacterium. This is utilized in phage typing, a technique of identifying bacteria by the action of known phages on them. See also lysogeny.

bacteriostatic adj. capable of inhibiting or retarding the growth and multiplication of bacteria. Erythromycin is bacteriostatic. Compare bactericidal.

bacterium n. see bacteria.

bacteriuria n. the presence of bacteria in the urine (105/ml) with or without symptoms of urinary tract infection (e.g. burning or frequent urination). Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in women (especially during pregnancy), the elderly, and in patients with diabetes, bladder catheters, and spinal cord injuries. Unless treated with antibiotics, patients are at higher risk of kidney infections (*pyelonephritis).

Bacteroides n. a genus of Gram-negative, mostly nonmotile, anaerobic rodlike bacteria. They are normally present in the alimentary and urinogenital tracts of mammals and are found in the mouth, particularly in dental plaque associated with periodontal disease. Some species have now been classified into the genera Porphyromonas and Prevotella.

bagassosis n. a form of external allergic *alveolitis caused by exposure to the dust of mouldy bagasse, the residue of sugar cane after the sugar has been extracted, which is used in the production of hardboard and other thermal boards. Symptoms usually appear in the evening after exposure during the day and include fever, malaise, irritant cough, and respiratory distress.

BAL see bronchoalveolar lavage.

balanced salt solution (BSS) a solution containing physiological concentrations of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium citrate. Such fluids are isotonic to eye tissue; they are used during intraocular surgery and to replace intraocular fluids.

balanitis n. inflammation of the glans penis, usually associated with tightness of the foreskin (*phimosis). It is more common in childhood than in adult life. An acute attack is associated with redness and swelling of the glans. Treatment is by antibiotics, and further attacks are prevented by *circumcision. In Zoon’s plasma cell balanitis persistent shiny red patches develop on the glans; the cause is unknown. Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO, lichen sclerosis et atrophicus) is an autoimmune condition characterized by ivory-white patches on the glans associated with stenosis of the urethral meatus and urethral strictures.

balanoposthitis n. inflammation of the foreskin and the surface of the underlying glans penis. It usually occurs as a consequence of *phimosis and represents a more extensive local reaction than simple *balanitis. The affected areas become red and swollen, which further narrows the opening of the foreskin and makes passing urine difficult and painful. Treatment of an acute attack is by administration of antibiotics, and further attacks are prevented by *circumcision.

balantidiasis n. an infestation of the large intestine with the parasitic protozoan *Balantidium coli. Humans usually become infected by ingesting food or drink contaminated with cysts from the faeces of a pig. The parasite invades and destroys the intestinal wall, causing ulceration and *necrosis, and the patient may experience diarrhoea and dysentery. Balantidiasis is a rare cause of dysentery, mainly affecting farm workers; it is treated with various antibiotics.

Balantidium n. a genus of one of the largest parasitic *protozoans affecting humans (70 μm or more in length). The oval body is covered with threadlike cilia (for locomotion). B. coli, normally living in the gut of pigs as a harmless *commensal, occasionally infects humans (see balantidiasis).

baldness n. see alopecia.

Balint’s syndrome a disorder, arising from bilateral occipito-parietal *strokes, characterized by inability to perceive the visual field as a whole (simultanagnosia), difficulty in fixating the eyes (oculomotor apraxia), and inability to move the hand to a specific object using vision (optic ataxia). [R. Balint (1874–1929), Hungarian neurologist]

Balkan nephropathy a severe and progressive form of tubulointerstitial renal disease (see tubulointerstitium), first described in 1956 and endemic to certain rural areas along the tributaries of the Danube in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The natural course of the disease is progression to end-stage kidney failure and frequent development of tumours in the upper urinary tract. It seems likely that an environmental factor is responsible for the disease, and evidence supports the theory that long-term consumption of food contaminated with seeds from plants of *Aristolochia spp. underlies the pathogenesis.

ball-and-cage valve a form of mechanical prosthesis commonly used in the past for replacing damaged heart valves. Currently, most mechanical valve replacements are of the tilting-disc variety.

ball-and-socket joint see enarthrosis.

Ballantyne syndrome (maternal mirror syndrome) a condition that occurs in cases of *hydrops fetalis when the maternal condition begins to mirror the state of the fetus. The maternal signs and symptoms are similar to those of *pre-eclampsia, including vomiting, hypertension, oedema, and proteinuria.

ballism n. violent repetitive involuntary movements particularly involving the proximal limbs. They occur following bilateral damage to the *subthalamic nuclei of the basal ganglia, most commonly after stroke, haemorrhage, or trauma. In hemiballismus, only one side of the body is affected due to contralateral subthalamic dysfunction.

balloon n. an inflatable plastic cylinder of variable size that is mounted on a thin tube and used for dilating narrow areas (*stenosis) in blood vessels (see angioplasty), in the alimentary tract (*strictures), or in the urinary tract (see endopyelotomy).

balloon Eustachian tuboplasty a surgical procedure used to treat dysfunction of the *Eustachian tube. A small balloon is inserted from the *nasopharynx into the Eustachian tube in a deflated state under endoscopic control. It is then inflated to widen the Eustachian tube before being deflated and removed.

balloon sinuplasty a surgical procedure to open or enlarge a blocked ostium of the *paranasal sinuses in patients with chronic *rhinosinusitis. A small balloon is inserted into the ostium in a deflated state under endoscopic control. It is then inflated to enlarge the ostium and finally deflated and removed.

ballottement n. the technique of examining a fluid-filled part of the body to detect a floating object. During pregnancy, a sharp tap with the fingers, applied to the uterus through the abdominal wall or the vagina, causes the fetus to move away and then return to impart an answering tap to the examiner’s hand as it floats back to its original position. This confirms that swelling of the uterus is due to a fetus rather than a tumour or other abnormality.

balneotherapy n. the treatment of disease by bathing, usually in the mineral-containing waters of hot springs. The once fashionable ‘water cures’, taken at spas, certainly had a more psychological than physical effect. Today, specialized remedial treatment in baths, under the supervision of physiotherapists, is used to alleviate pain and improve blood circulation and limb mobility in arthritis and in nerve and muscle disorders.

bamboo spine an X-ray appearance of the spine in which there is squaring of the vertebrae and vertical *syndesmophytes that span adjacent vertebrae, so that the spine resembles a stick of bamboo. This results in fusion of the spine with a very limited range of motion. It is seen in ankylosing *spondylitis.

banana and lemon signs ultrasound features of the *Arnold–Chiari malformation in fetuses with spina bifida. The banana sign refers to the shape of the cerebellum owing to caudal displacement; the lemon sign refers to the lemon-shaped head resulting from scalloping of the frontal bones. See illustration.

bandage n. a piece of material, in the form of a pad or strip, applied to a wound or used to bind around an injured or diseased part of the body.

bandage lens a soft contact lens that can be useful in managing certain external eye disorders, including tiny perforations.

band keratopathy the deposition of calcium in the superficial layers of the cornea, usually as a horizontal band starting peripherally and moving centrally. It is associated with chronic eye disease, e.g. chronic *uveitis, particularly juvenile chronic uveitis. It is treated by application of EDTA (see edetate) or with an *excimer laser.

band ligation (banding) see oesophageal varices. See also gastric banding.

Bandl’s ring see retraction ring. [L. Bandl (1842–92), German obstetrician]

Banti’s syndrome a disorder in which enlargement and overactivity of the spleen occurs as a result of increased pressure within the splenic vein (see hypersplenism; splenomegaly). It arises primarily in children and occurs with *cirrhosis of the liver. [G. Banti (1852–1925), Italian pathologist]

barbiturate n. any of a group of drugs, derived from barbituric acid, that depress activity of the central nervous system and were formerly widely used as sedatives and hypnotics. They are classified into three groups according to their duration of action – short, intermediate, and long. Because they produce *tolerance and psychological and physical *dependence, have serious toxic side-effects (see barbiturism), and can be fatal following large overdosage, barbiturates have been largely replaced in clinical use by safer drugs. The main exception is the very short-acting drug *thiopental, which is used to induce anaesthesia. See also amobarbital; butobarbital; phenobarbital.

barbiturism n. addiction to drugs of the barbiturate group. Signs of intoxication include confusion, slurring of speech, yawning, sleepiness, loss of memory, loss of balance, and reduction in muscular reflexes. Withdrawal of the drugs must be undertaken slowly, over 1–3 weeks, to avoid the withdrawal symptoms of tremors and convulsions, which can prove fatal.

barefoot doctor see medical assistant.

bariatric surgery surgery performed for the purpose of weight loss in obese patients. Most procedures are restrictive, being designed to promote feelings of fullness and satiety after meals (see gastric banding; stomach stapling). See also gastric bypass surgery; jaw wiring.

baritosis n. a lung disease – a form of *pneumoconiosis – caused by inhaling barium dust. It gives dramatic shadows on chest X-rays but no respiratory disability.

barium enema a radiological technique used to diagnose conditions of the large bowel using the combination of X-ray imaging and radiopaque contrast (barium sulphate). Prior bowel cleansing is usually required with a colonic cleansing preparation. A large-bore tube with a balloon is inserted into the rectum and through this the barium is delivered to the caecum. The balloon is inflated in the rectum to prevent leakage of barium outside. In *double contrast studies, air is passed through the catheter to distend the colon. A series of radiographs are taken after barium has coated the colon, and the patient may be asked to change position to ensure that the whole bowel is delineated. Barium enema is used to identify colonic polyps, colorectal cancer, and diverticular disease. However, its role has been largely taken over by *colonoscopy which enables additional mucosal sampling and therapeutic intervention.

barium follow-through see small-bowel meal.

barium sulphate a barium salt, extremely insoluble in water, that is opaque to X-rays and is used as a *contrast medium in radiography of the gastrointestinal tract (see barium enema; barium swallow and meal).

barium swallow and meal a radiological technique used to assess the anatomy and function of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient swallows radiopaque contrast (barium sulphate), which coats the mucosal surfaces of the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The descent of the barium is charted by a series of radiographs. Gas-forming agents (such as sodium bicarbonate) may be given to aid gastric distension and improve the quality of the images. This can be used to diagnose disorders of oesophageal motor function, tumours, peptic ulcers, hiatus *hernias, and *gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Many indications for this examination have been replaced by the use of an endoscope.

Barlow manoeuvre a test for *congenital dislocation of the hip that detects whether or not a hip can be readily dislocated. With the baby lying supine and the pelvis steadied with one hand, the hip being tested is gently adducted and backward pressure is applied to the head of the femur. If the hip is dislocatable, a clunk will be felt and sometimes heard (Von Rosen’s sign). If the hip is gently abducted, it will usually relocate. [T. Barlow (1845–1945), British physician]

BARN bilateral *acute retinal necrosis.

baroreceptor (baroceptor) n. a collection of sensory nerve endings specialized to monitor changes in blood pressure. The main receptors lie in the *carotid sinuses and the *aortic arch; others are found in the walls of other large arteries and veins and some within the walls of the heart. Impulses from the receptors reach centres in the medulla; from here autonomic activity is directed so that the heart rate and resistance of the peripheral blood vessels can be adjusted appropriately.

barotitis n. disease of the ear caused by changing air pressure, as experienced during air travel.

barotrauma n. damage to the ear, *Eustachian tube, or paranasal sinuses caused by changes in ambient pressure, as experienced during air flight or deep-sea diving.

Barr body see sex chromatin. [M. L. Barr (1908–95), Canadian anatomist]

Barrett’s oesophagus (columnar-lined oesophagus) a condition in which the squamous *epithelium lining the oesophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium of the type normally lining the intestine (‘intestinal metaplasia’). Barrett’s oesophagus is caused by chronic inflammation and damage resulting from *gastro-oesophageal reflux or (less frequently) corrosive *oesophagitis. The appearance of Barrett’s epithelium seen at endoscopy must be confirmed by biopsy. Patients with confirmed Barrett’s oesophagus are at a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma and may be kept under surveillance with regular endoscopies. [N. R. Barrett (1903–79), British thoracic surgeon]

barrier cream a preparation used to protect the skin against water-soluble irritants (e.g. detergents, breakdown products of urine). Usually applied in the form of a cream or ointment and often containing a silicone (such as *dimeticone), barrier creams are useful in the alleviation of various skin disorders, including napkin rash and pressure sores.

Barron’s banding apparatus an apparatus for treating haemorrhoids in which a tight elastic band is applied across their base to cause ischaemic necrosis leading to sloughing off within a few days.

bartholinitis n. inflammation of *Bartholin’s glands. In chronic bartholinitis cysts may form in the glands as a result of blockage of their ducts. In acute bartholinitis abscess formation may occur (Bartholin’s abscess).

Bartholin’s glands (greater vestibular glands) a pair of glands that open at the junction of the vagina and the external genitalia (vulva). Their secretions lubricate the vulva and so assist penetration by the penis during coitus. The lesser vestibular glands, around the vaginal opening, perform the same function. [C. Bartholin (1655–1738), Danish anatomist]

Bartonella (Haemobartonella) n. a genus of Gram-negative bacteria that are facultative intracellular parasites. They occur in the red blood cells and cells of the lymphatic system, spleen, liver, and kidneys and cause several infections in humans (see bartonellosis).

bartonellosis n. an infectious disease, largely confined to high river valleys in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, caused by the bacterium *Bartonella bacilliformis. The parasite, present in red blood cells and cells of the lymphatic system, is transmitted to humans by sandflies. There are two clinical types of the disease: Oroya fever (Carrion’s disease), whose symptoms include fever, anaemia, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; and verruga peruana, characterized by wartlike eruptions on the skin that can bleed easily and ulcerate. Oroya fever accounts for nearly all fatalities. Bartonellosis can be treated successfully with penicillin and other antibiotics and blood transfusions may be given to relieve the anaemia.

Other species of Bartonella cause *cat-scratch disease and *trench fever.

Bartter syndrome an inherited condition of the kidney, which causes abnormalities in the excretion and reabsorption of salts from the blood. This results in lowered levels of potassium and chloride and an increased level of calcium. The baby fails to grow properly and becomes progressively weaker and dehydrated. Treatment consists of correcting the salt imbalance with appropriate supplements. [F. C. Bartter (1914–83), US physician]

basal cell carcinoma (BCC) the commonest form of skin cancer. Although classified as a malignant tumour, it grows very slowly and hardly ever metastasizes. BCC usually occurs on the central area of the face, especially in fair-skinned people; the prevalence increases greatly with episodes of sunburn. The initial sign is a spot or lump that fails to heal, which slowly enlarges. Treatment depends on subtype and is usually straightforward, e.g. topical chemotherapy agents (such as 5-fluorouracil), *curettage and cautery, surgical excision, *cryotherapy, or *radiotherapy. High-risk BCCs around the eyes or nose may be treated with *Mohs’ micrographic surgery to ensure low rates of recurrence and maximal tissue conservation. Only if neglected for decades does a BCC eventually become a so-called rodent ulcer and destroy the surrounding tissue. However, the term ‘rodent ulcer’ is still sometimes used to mean any basal cell carcinoma.

basal ganglia several large masses of grey matter embedded deep within the white matter of the *cerebrum (see illustration). They include the caudate and lenticular nuclei (together known as the corpus striatum) and the amygdaloid nucleus. The lenticular nucleus consists of the putamen and globus pallidus. The basal ganglia have complex neural connections with both the cerebral cortex and thalamus: they are involved with the regulation of voluntary movements at a subconscious level. Diseases of the basal ganglia cause a range of disorders predominantly affecting movement, the commonest being *parkinsonism.

The basal ganglia. Showing their position in relation to neighbouring parts (seen from the front).





basal metabolism the minimum amount of energy expended by the body to maintain vital processes, e.g. respiration, circulation, and digestion. It is expressed in terms of heat production per unit of body surface area per day (basal metabolic rate – BMR), and for an average man the BMR is 1.7 Calories (7.115 kilojoules) per day. BMR may be determined by the direct method, in which the subject is placed in a respiratory chamber and the amount of heat evolved is measured, or (more normally) by the indirect method, based on the *respiratory quotient. Measurements are best taken during a period of least activity, i.e. during sleep and 12–18 hours after a meal, under controlled temperature conditions. Various factors, such as age, sex, and particularly thyroid activity, influence the value of the BMR.

basement membrane the thin delicate membrane that lies at the base of an *epithelium. It is composed of mucopolysaccharide and fibres of protein.

base pairing the linking of the two strands of a DNA molecule by means of hydrogen bonds between the bases of the nucleotides. Adenine always pairs with thymine and cytosine with guanine. See DNA.

basic life support the provision of treatment designed to maintain adequate circulation and ventilation to a patient in *cardiac arrest, without the use of drugs or specialist equipment. Compare advanced life support.

basilar artery an artery in the base of the brain, formed by the union of the two vertebral arteries. It extends from the lower to the upper border of the pons Varolii and then divides to form the two posterior cerebral arteries.

basilar membrane a membrane in the *cochlea of the ear that separates two of the three channels (scalae) that run the length of the spiral cochlea. The organ of Corti is situated on the basilar membrane, inside the scala media.

basilic vein a large vein in the arm, extending from the hand along the back of the forearm, then passing forward to the inner side of the arm at the elbow.

basion n. the midpoint of the anterior border of the large hole (foramen magnum) at the base of the *skull.

basophil 1. n. a variety of white blood cell distinguished by a lobed nucleus and the presence in its cytoplasm of coarse granules that stain purple-black with *Romanowsky stains. Basophils are capable of ingesting foreign particles and contain *histamine and *heparin. There are normally 30–150 × 106 basophils per litre of blood. See also polymorph. 2. (basophilic) adj. describing any cell that stains well with basic dyes. For example, certain cells in the anterior pituitary gland are basophilic.

basophilia n. 1. a property of a microscopic structure whereby it shows an affinity for basic dyes. 2. an increase in the number of certain white blood cells (*basophils) in the blood, which may occur in a variety of blood diseases.

basophilic adj. see basophil.

bat ears see protruding ears.

bathyaesthesia n. sensation experienced in the deeper parts of the body, such as the joints and muscles.

Batten’s disease one of a group of rare hereditary disorders (known as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses) that also includes *Tay-Sachs disease. Fatty substances accumulate in the cells of the nervous system, causing progressive dementia, epilepsy, spasticity, and visual failure. The condition starts in late infancy or childhood. There is no treatment. [F. E. Batten (1865–1918), British neurologist]

battered baby syndrome see nonaccidental injury.

battery n. (in law) the wrongful touching of another person, which may be a criminal offence or a tort in civil law (the latter is known as trespass against the person). Any intentional touching of another is a potential battery unless it occurs with the *consent of the person involved. Consent therefore provides a defence against a charge of battery brought in relation to medical treatment.

Bazin’s disease a rare disease of young women in which tender nodules develop under the skin in the calves. The condition is a *tuberculide; the nodules may break down and ulcerate though they may clear up spontaneously. Medical name: erythema induratum. [A. P. E. Bazin (1807–78), French dermatologist]

BCC see basal cell carcinoma.

B cell n. see lymphocyte.

BCG (bacille Calmette–Guérin) a strain of tubercle bacillus that has lost the power to cause *tuberculosis but retains its antigenic activity; it is therefore used to prepare a vaccine against the disease.

BCI bladder contractility index: a scale used to grade how strongly the urinary bladder can contract.

bear tracks (in ophthalmology) areas of hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (see retina) that clinically resemble the prints of bears’ paws.

Beau’s lines transverse depressions on the nails appearing some weeks or months after a severe illness or chemotherapy. [J. H. S. Beau (1806–65), French physician]

Becker muscular dystrophy a *sex-linked (X-linked) disorder in which affected males develop an increase in muscle size followed by weakness and wasting. It usually starts between the ages of 5 and 15, and 25 years after onset most patients are wheelchair-bound. Although most men become severely disabled, life expectancy is close to normal. The disorder is similar to Duchenne *muscular dystrophy but less severe. [P. E. Becker (20th century), German geneticist]

Becker’s naevus (Becker melanosis) an irregularly shaped hyperpigmented patch that contains more hairs than is normal (hypertrichosis). The patch usually appears over half the upper trunk or shoulders in the mid- to late teens, expands over a period of 1–2 years, and persists for life. It is more common in males. No treatment is necessary except for cosmetic reasons. [W. Becker (1894–1964), US dermatologist]

Beck’s triad see cardiac tamponade. [C. S. Beck (1894–1971), US surgeon]

beclometasone n. a *corticosteroid drug that is administered by mouth to treat ulcerative colitis, by nasal spray to treat hay fever, as a cream or ointment to treat severe skin infections, and by inhaler for the prevention of asthma. Possible side-effects include nasal irritation and hoarseness.

becquerel n. the *SI unit of activity of a radioactive source, being the activity of a radionuclide decaying at a rate of one spontaneous nuclear transition per second. It has replaced the curie. Symbol: Bq.

bed bug a bloodsucking insect of the genus Cimex. C. hemipterus of the tropics and C. lectularius of temperate regions have reddish flattened bodies and vestigial wings. They live and lay their eggs in the crevices of walls and furniture and emerge at night to suck blood; although bed bugs are not known vectors of disease their bites leave a route for bacterial infection. Premises can be disinfested with appropriate insecticides.

bed occupancy the number of hospital beds occupied by patients expressed as a percentage of the total beds available in the ward, specialty, hospital, area, or region. It may be recorded in relation to a defined point in time or more usefully for a period, when the calculation is based on bed-days. It is used with other indices (such as *admission rate) to assess the demands for hospital beds in relation to diseases, specialties, or populations and hence to gauge an appropriate balance between demand for health care and number of beds.

bedsore n. see pressure sore.

bedwetting n. see enuresis.

behaviourism n. an approach to psychology postulating that only observable behaviour need be studied, thus denying any importance to unconscious processes. Behaviourists are concerned with the laws regulating the occurrence of behaviour (see conditioning). —behaviourist n.

behaviour modification the use of the methods of behaviourist psychology (see behaviourism) – especially operant *conditioning – to alter people’s behaviour. Behaviour modification has wider applications than *behaviour therapy, since it is also used in situations in which the client is not ill; for example, in education. See also chaining; prompting.

behaviour therapy treatment based on the belief that certain psychological problems are the products of faulty learning. Treatment is directed at the problem or target behaviour and is designed for the particular patient, not for the particular underlying diagnosis the patient may have. See also aversion therapy; conditioning; desensitization; exposure; response prevention.

Behçet’s syndrome an idiopathic disease of the immune system characterized by *aphthous ulcers in the mouth, genital ulcers, skin lesions, and severe inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye (see uveitis). It may also involve the joints and nervous system and cause inflammation of the veins. The condition occurs more often in men than women. Treatment is aimed at controlling the immune system. [H. Behçet (1889–1948), Turkish dermatologist]

bejel (endemic syphilis) n. a long-lasting nonvenereal form of *syphilis that occurs in the Balkans, Turkey, eastern Mediterranean countries, and the dry savannah regions of North Africa; it is particularly prevalent where standards of personal hygiene are low. The disease is spread among children and adults by direct body contact. Early skin lesions are obvious in the moist areas of the body (mouth, armpits, and groin) and later there may be considerable destruction of the tissues of the skin, nasopharynx, and long bones. Wartlike eruptions in the anal and genital regions are common. Bejel, which is rarely fatal, is treated with penicillin.

bel n. see decibel.

belladonna n. the deadly nightshade plant (Atropa belladonna) or the mixture of alkaloids derived from it, which include *atropine and *hyoscine.

bell and pad a psychological method of treating bed-wetting in children and adults. When the subject starts to pass urine it is detected by a pad (or by sheets of metallic mesh) and this sets off a bell (or loud buzzer). The modern form of the apparatus has a small electronic sensor worn under the underclothes and produces a loud bleep. The purpose of the alarm is to waken the subject, who then empties the bladder fully. A process of conditioning leads to the subject learning to be dry. It is effective in about 80% of cases.

belle indifference a symptom of *conversion disorder in which an apparently grave physical affliction or disability (which has no physical cause) is accepted in a smiling and calm fashion. It can also be a sign of dementia or psychosis.

Bell’s palsy paralysis of the *facial nerve causing weakness of the muscles of one side of the face and an inability to close the eye. In some patients hearing may be affected so that sounds seem abnormally loud, and a loss of taste sensation may occur. The cause of this condition is usually a viral infection, and recovery normally occurs spontaneously. [Sir C. Bell (1774–1842), Scottish physiologist]

Bell’s phenomenon the normal outward and upward rotation of the eyes that occurs when the lids are closed, but not during blinking. [Sir C. Bell]

belly n. 1. the *abdomen or abdominal cavity. 2. the central fleshy portion of a muscle.

Bence-Jones protein a protein of low molecular weight found in the urine of patients with multiple *myeloma and rarely in patients with *lymphoma, *leukaemia, and *Hodgkin’s disease. [H. Bence-Jones (1814–73), British physician]

benchmarking n. in public health, a process in which best practice is identified and continuous improvement is generated through the sharing of evidence and the comparison of practice. See also practice development.

bendroflumethiazide (bendrofluazide) n. a potent thiazide *diuretic used in the treatment of conditions involving retention of fluid, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, and *oedema. Side-effects include a fall in blood pressure on standing up, dizziness, lethargy, and muscle cramps.

bends n. see compressed air illness.

Benedict’s test a test for the presence of sugar in urine or other liquids. A few drops of the test solution are added to Benedict’s solution, prepared from sodium or potassium citrate, sodium carbonate, and copper sulphate. The mixture is boiled and shaken for about two minutes, then left to cool. The presence of up to 2% glucose is indicated by the formation of a reddish, yellowish, or greenish precipitate, the highest levels corresponding to the red coloration, the lowest (about 0.05%) to the green. [S. R. Benedict (1884–1936), US surgeon]

beneficence n. doing good: one of the *four principles of medical ethics. The obligation to act in patients’ *best interests at all times is recognized in ancient and modern codes of professional conduct, e.g. the *Hippocratic oath. Benefits in health care, and therefore beneficence, must commonly be balanced against risks or harms (i.e. *nonmaleficence). The courts have been clear that beneficence extends beyond medical interests. Respect for *autonomy requires that professionals determine what the patient considers to be doing good in any given situation.

benign adj. 1. describing a tumour that does not invade and destroy the tissue in which it originates or spread to distant sites in the body, i.e. a tumour that is not cancerous. Benign tumours may nonetheless cause serious morbidity or mortality by compressing or obstructing vital structures. 2. describing any disorder or condition that does not produce harmful effects. Compare malignant.

benign intracranial hypertension see idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) a common cause of vertigo in which the patient complains of brief episodes of rotatory vertigo precipitated by sudden head movements. It is thought to be due to microscopic debris derived from the *otoliths of the utricle and displaced into one of the semicircular canals, most commonly the posterior semicircular canal. The debris is most commonly thought to be free in the canal (canalithiasis; see canalith) but can be attached to the *cupula (cupulolithiasis; see cupulolith). Diagnosis is by performing a *Dix–Hallpike test. Treatment is with a predetermined set of head movements to move the debris from the semicircular canal (see Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre; Semont liberatory manoeuvre; Brandt-Daroff exercises). Surgery is occasionally used to occlude the relevant semicircular canal, cut the *singular nerve or vestibular nerves, or perform a *labyrinthectomy. Drugs are generally ineffective in the treatment of this condition.

benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) see prostate gland.

benperidol n. a *butyrophenone antipsychotic drug used mainly to treat deviant and antisocial sexual behaviour.

benserazide n. see levodopa.

benzalkonium n. an antiseptic used in preparations for treating infections of the mouth and throat and various skin conditions.

benzhexol n. see trihexyphenidyl.

benzodiazepines pl. n. a group of pharmacologically active compounds used as *anxiolytics and hypnotics. The group includes *chlordiazepoxide, *diazepam, *oxazepam, and *temazepam.

benzoic acid an antiseptic, active against fungi and bacteria, used as a preservative in foods and pharmaceutical preparations and, combined with salicylic acid, in the form of an ointment (Whitfield’s ointment) for the treatment of ringworm.

benzoyl peroxide a preparation used in the treatment of acne. It acts by removing the surface layers of the epidermis and unblocking skin pores and has an antiseptic effect on skin bacteria. Side-effects may include skin irritation.

benzydamine hydrochloride an anti-inflammatory drug (see NSAID) administered as a mouthwash or spray for the relief of inflammatory ulcerative conditions of the mouth and throat.

benzyl benzoate an oily aromatic liquid that is applied to the body – in the form of an emulsion – for the treatment of scabies. It causes skin irritation and should not be used to treat children.

benzylpenicillin n. see penicillin.

bereavement n. the state or feeling of having lost a loved one, especially through death. It is usually manifest as mental anguish (grief), and bereaved people may lose weight, cry without ceasing, withdraw and wish themselves dead, or suffer from abnormal perceptions (that they hear or see the departed). Bereavement should be distinguished from other conditions. As in other forms of *loss, acceptance will usually come, but in some situations, such as a mother losing a child, the feeling is life-long and may deepen with time.

Berger’s nephropathy (IgA nephropathy) an abnormality of the kidney in which there is a focal area of inflammation (*glomerulonephritis). This causes microscopic amounts of blood in the urine. A quarter of the patients with this condition may develop kidney failure. [J. Berger (20th century), French nephrologist]

beriberi n. a nutritional disorder due to deficiency of *vitamin B1 (thiamine). It is widespread in rice-eating communities in which the diet is based on polished rice, from which the seed coat (which is rich in thiamine) has been removed. Beriberi takes two forms: wet beriberi, in which there is an accumulation of tissue fluid (*oedema), and dry beriberi, in which there is extreme emaciation. There is nervous degeneration in both forms of the disease and death from heart failure is often the outcome.

berry aneurysm see aneurysm.

berylliosis n. poisoning by beryllium or its compounds, either by inhalation or by skin contamination. Inhalation of fumes from molten beryllium causes an acute *alveolitis and is usually fatal. Subacute and chronic forms can result from extremely low levels of exposure to the powder and can produce granulomata in the skin or lungs very similar to those seen in *sarcoidosis. In the lungs, these lead to fibrosis, which can, however, be prevented by prompt use of oral corticosteroids. Although the incidence of berylliosis has been greatly reduced since the use of beryllium compounds in the manufacture of fluorescent light tubes was discontinued in Britain in 1948, new cases are still occurring.

best interests a legal and ethical standard in medical care and treatment. A doctor has both an ethical and a legal obligation to maximize a patient’s welfare or wellbeing. When cases have gone to court, the judiciary has been clear that the concept of best interests extends beyond the purely medical. The principle of *autonomy requires that a patient with *capacity is in the best position to determine what is in his or her best interests. Where a patient lacks capacity, health-care professionals must act in his or her best interests. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, a doctor must take account of the patient’s wishes and try to determine what he or she would have wanted, possibly with reference to an advance directive (see advance directive, decision, or statement), an appointed proxy, or an *independent mental capacity advocacy service. The interests of children are especially important, and doctors must be particularly vigilant where there is a potential conflict of interests, as when reporting cases of suspected child abuse or recruiting for paediatric research.

Best’s disease see vitelliform degeneration. [F. Best (20th century), German physician]

beta agonist see sympathomimetic.

beta blocker (beta-adrenergic receptor blocker) a drug that prevents stimulation of the beta *adrenoceptors at the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system. Blockade of β1 receptors causes a decrease in heart rate and force; blockade of β2 receptors causes constriction of the airways and the arteries. Beta blockers include *acebutolol, *atenolol, *bisoprolol, *oxprenolol, *propranolol, and *sotalol; they are used to control abnormal heart rhythms, to treat angina, and to reduce high blood pressure (although they are no longer regarded by some experts as the first choice of drug for treating hypertension in the absence of heart disease, being less effective than newer antihypertensive drugs). Beta blockers that block both β1 and β2 receptor sites cause constriction of air passages in the lungs, and these drugs should not be used in patients with asthma and bronchospasm. Other beta blockers are relatively selective for the heart (cardioselective) and are less likely to constrict the airways. Some beta blockers (e.g. *carteolol, *levobunolol, and *timolol) reduce the production of aqueous humour and therefore the pressure inside the eye; they are taken as eye drops in the treatment of *glaucoma.

beta cells see islets of Langerhans.

betahistine n. a drug that is an *analogue of *histamine and increases blood flow through the inner ear. It is administered to treat *Ménière’s disease. Side-effects are uncommon but include gastric upset.

beta-lactam antibiotic one of a group of drugs that includes the *penicillins and the *cephalosporins. All have a four-membered beta-lactam ring as part of their molecular structure. Beta-lactam antibiotics function by interfering with the growth of the cell walls of multiplying bacteria. Bacteria become resistant to these antibiotics by producing beta-lactamases, enzymes (such as *penicillinase) that disrupt the beta-lactam ring. To counteract this, beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. *clavulanic acid) may be added to beta-lactam antibiotics. For example, co-amoxiclav is a mixture of *amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

betamethasone n. a synthetic corticosteroid used to treat inflammatory and allergic conditions and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The side-effects are those of *cortisone.

betaxolol n. a *beta blocker administered to treat chronic simple *glaucoma. Possible side-effects are local stinging and burning.

bevacizumab n. a *monoclonal antibody that interferes with the growth of new blood vessels (see angiogenesis) by inhibiting the action of *vascular endothelial growth factor. It is licensed for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. Side-effects include hypertension, bowel perforation, and bleeding; there may be a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

bezafibrate n. a drug that is used to treat hyperlipidaemia that fails to respond to diet (see fibrates). Possible side-effects include skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, and muscle pain.

bezoar n. a mass of swallowed indigestible material within the stomach. The material, which is usually swallowed by patients with psychiatric disorders, or children, may accumulate and lead to gastric obstruction. Its removal often requires surgery. See also trichobezoar.

BHT see black hairy tongue.

bi- combining form denoting two; double. Examples: biciliate (having two cilia); binucleate (having two nuclei).

bias n. systematic deviation of results from the truth. The many different types of bias include selection bias (failing to select a sample that is representative of the wider population), nonresponse bias (respondents differing from nonrespondents in statistical surveys), social desirability bias (respondents giving false answers they believe to be more socially acceptable than the truth), and systematic measurement errors (all measurements deviate from the truth in the same systematic fashion).

bicalutamide n. a nonsteroidal *anti-androgen commonly used to treat locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. It binds to and blocks the androgen receptor but does not reduce the levels of testosterone in the blood, thus preserving libido and general energy levels. Side-effects include breast enlargement, tenderness, and pain.

biceps n. a muscle with two heads. The biceps brachii extends from the shoulder joint to the elbow (see illustration). It flexes the arm and forearm and supinates the forearm and hand. The biceps femoris is situated at the back of the thigh and is responsible for flexing the knee, extending the thigh, and rotating the leg outwards.

The biceps muscle of the arm.





biceps jerk a deep tendon reflex mediated by the fifth cervical *spinal nerve (C5). The examiner’s thumb or index finger is placed over the patient’s biceps tendon in the elbow crease and struck sharply with a tendon hammer; the normal response is a reflex contraction of the biceps and flexion of the elbow. The jerk is exaggerated in upper *motor neuron lesions, such as a stroke, and reduced or absent in lower motor neuron lesions, such as a disc herniation, peripheral nerve injury, or peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetes, alcoholism).

biconcave adj. having a hollowed surface on both sides. Biconcave lenses are used to correct short-sightedness. Compare biconvex.

biconvex adj. having a surface on each side that curves outwards. Biconvex lenses are used to correct long-sightedness. Compare biconcave.

bicornuate adj. having two hornlike processes or projections. The term is applied to an abnormal uterus that is divided into two separate halves at the upper end.

BICROS hearing aid see contralateral-routing-of-signal hearing aid.

bicuspid 1. adj. having two *cusps, as in the premolar teeth and the mitral valve of the heart. 2. n. (in the USA) a premolar tooth.

bicuspid valve see mitral valve.

Bielschowsky head tilt an orthoptic eye test used mainly to differentiate between a weakness of the superior oblique muscle and a weakness of the contralateral superior rectus muscle (see extrinsic muscle). [A. Bielschowsky (1871–1940), German ophthalmologist]

bifid adj. split or cleft into two parts.

bifocal lens a lens with two principal focal lengths: usually the upper part of the lens gives a sharp image of distant objects and the lower part gives a sharp image of near objects. Examples are bifocal spectacles, bifocal contact lenses, and bifocal intraocular lenses. See also trifocal lenses; multifocal lenses.

bifurcation n. (in anatomy) the point at which division into two branches occurs; for example in blood vessels or in the trachea.

bigeminal body one of the two swellings that develop in the roof of the midbrain during its development in the embryo.

bigeminy n. the condition in which alternate *ectopic beats of the heart are transmitted to the pulse and felt as a double pulse beat (pulsus bigeminus). It is usually benign.

biguanide n. one of the group of drugs including *metformin, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Biguanides are *oral hypoglycaemic drugs: they act by reducing the release of glucose from the liver and increasing glucose uptake by muscles.

bilateral adj. (in anatomy) relating to or affecting both sides of the body or of a tissue or organ or both of a pair of organs (e.g. the eyes, breasts, or ovaries).

bile n. a thick alkaline fluid that is secreted by the *liver and stored in the *gall bladder, from which it is ejected intermittently into the duodenum via the common *bile duct. Bile may be yellow, green, or brown, according to the proportions of the *bile pigments (excretory products) present; other constituents are lecithin, cholesterol, and *bile salts. The bile salts help to emulsify fats in the duodenum so that they can be more easily digested by pancreatic *lipase into fatty acids and glycerol. Bile salts also form compounds with fatty acids, which can then be transported into the *lacteals. Bile also helps to stimulate *peristalsis in the duodenum.

bile acids the organic acids in bile; mostly occurring as bile salts (sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate). They are cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, and taurocholic acid.

bile-acid sequestrant a drug that binds to bile acids, forming a complex that is excreted in the faeces. Bile acids are formed in the liver from *cholesterol and the effect of loss of bile acids is a reduction in total body cholesterol and a decrease in *low-density lipoprotein serum levels. These drugs, which include *colestyramine and *colestipol, are used to treat patients with abnormally high blood cholesterol levels who are liable to develop coronary heart disease.

bile duct any of the ducts that convey bile from the liver. Bile is drained from the liver cells by many small ducts into the right and left hepatic ducts, which unite to form the main bile duct of the liver, the common hepatic duct. This joins the cystic duct, which leads from the *gall bladder, to form the common bile duct, which drains into the duodenum. The bile ducts collectively are known as the biliary tree.

bile pigments coloured compounds – breakdown products of the blood pigment *haemoglobin – that are excreted in *bile. The two most important bile pigments are bilirubin, which is orange or yellow, and its oxidized form biliverdin, which is green. Mixed with the intestinal contents, they give the brown colour to the faeces (see urobilinogen).

bile salts sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate – the alkaline salts of *bile – necessary for the emulsification of fats. After they have been absorbed from the intestine they are transported to the liver for reuse.

bi-level positive airways pressure see BiPAP.

Bilharzia n. see Schistosoma.

bilharziasis n. see schistosomiasis.

bili- combining form denoting bile.

biliary adj. relating to or affecting the bile duct or bile. See also fistula.

biliary atresia a congenital or acquired condition characterized by obstructed bile flow secondary to destruction or absence of extrahepatic bile ducts. Babies usually present within the first few weeks of life with jaundice that does not improve with time. Some forms of biliary atresia can be corrected surgically, but if the diagnosis has been delayed the condition may lead to irreversible liver damage requiring liver transplantation.

biliary colic severe abdominal pain resulting from obstruction of the cystic duct or common bile duct by (most commonly) a gallstone. The pain is felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen but may be poorly localized due to its visceral nature. It often occurs about an hour after a meal (particularly if fatty), may last several hours, and is usually constant in severity (unlike other forms of *colic). Vomiting often occurs.

bilious adj. 1. containing bile; for example bilious vomiting is the vomiting of bile-containing fluid. 2. a lay term used to describe attacks of nausea or vomiting.

bilirubin n. see bile pigments.

biliuria (choluria) n. the presence of bile in the urine: a feature of certain forms of jaundice.

biliverdin n. see bile pigments.

Billings method a method of planning pregnancy involving the daily examination of cervical mucus, which varies in consistency and colour throughout the menstrual cycle. Use of a Billings mucus observation chart to help identify the type of mucus enables the woman to have six days’ warning of impending ovulation. [J. and E. Billings (20th century), Australian physicians]

bimanual adj. using two hands to perform an activity, such as a gynaecological examination.

bimatoprost n. a *prostaglandin analogue (a prodrug) used topically as eye drops to control the progression of glaucoma and in the management of ocular hypertension. It reduces intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes.

binaural adj. relating to or involving the use of both ears.

binder n. a bandage that is wound around a part of the body, usually the abdomen, to apply pressure or to give support or protection.

binge–purge syndrome see bulimia.

binocular adj. relating to or involving the use of both eyes.

binocular vision the ability to focus both eyes on an object at the same time, so that a person sees one image of the object he is looking at. It is not inborn, but acquired during the first few months of life. Binocular vision enables judgment of distance and perception of depth. See also stereoscopic vision.

bio- combining form denoting life or living organisms. Example: biosynthesis (formation of a compound within a living organism).

bioassay n. estimation of the activity or potency of a drug or other substance by comparing its effects on living organisms with effects of a preparation of known strength. Bioassay is used to determine the strength of preparations of hormones or other material of biological origin when other physical or chemical methods are not available.

bioavailability n. the proportion of a drug that is delivered to its site of action in the body. This is usually the amount entering the circulation and may be low when the drugs are given by mouth.

biochemistry n. the study of the chemical processes and substances occurring in living things. —biochemical adj. —biochemist n.

biocompatibility n. the ability of a material or device to be tolerated by living tissue or a living system; this means it must not be toxic, injurious, or physiologically reactive and must not cause a negative immunological response. Biocompatibility is important for materials embedded in the body. —biocompatible adj.

bioengineering n. the application of biological and engineering principles to the development and manufacture of equipment and devices for use in biological systems. Examples of such products include orthopaedic prostheses and heart pacemakers.

bioethics n. an area of applied *ethics concerned with the life sciences generally and not limited to *medical ethics, academic study of which is often seen as a subspecialty of bioethics (biomedical ethics).

biofeedback n. the giving of immediate information to a subject about his or her bodily processes (such as heart rate), which are usually unconscious, by means of monitoring devices. This may enable some voluntary control over such processes. These processes can then be subject to operant *conditioning. This is an experimental treatment for disturbances of bodily regulation, such as hypertension.

biofilm n. an organized layer of microorganisms in which the cells stick to each other as well as to a surface. Biofilm may be implicated in several disease processes, including dental infections (see plaque), *endocarditis, infections of surgical implants, lung infections in people with *cystic fibrosis, and *glue ear. Its organized structure makes the biofilm resistant to attack.

biologic n. see biopharmaceutical.

biological response modifier (BRM) a therapeutic agent, such as *interferon or *interleukin, that influences the body’s defence mechanisms to act against infection and disease. In small amounts, these substances are produced naturally by the body; larger doses have been genetically developed for use against rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, and cancer (especially melanoma and renal cancer).

biological therapy any treatment that facilitates the ability of the immune system to fight disease, as opposed to acting directly against the disease (compare chemotherapy; radiotherapy). Such treatments, most commonly used for cancer and rheumatic disease, include *biological response modifiers, *immunotherapy, *monoclonal antibodies, *cytokine inhibitors and modulators, and *targeted agents.

biologic width (in dentistry) the combined width of the *junctional epithelium and connective tissue attachment around the root surface of a tooth: in other words, the distance between the deepest point of the gingival sulcus and the *alveolus. Dental restorations must respect this natural dimension if harmful consequences are to be avoided.

biology n. the study of living organisms – plants, animals, and microorganisms – including their structure and function and their relationships with one another and with the inanimate world. —biological adj.

biomarker n. a normal *metabolite that, when present in abnormal concentrations in certain body fluids, can indicate the presence of a particular disease or toxicological condition. For example, abnormal concentrations of glucose in the blood can be indicative of *diabetes mellitus.

biometry n. the measurement of living things and the processes associated with life, including the application of mathematics, particularly statistics, to problems in biology.

bionomics n. see ecology.

biopharmaceutical (biological medical product) n. in the widest sense, any therapeutic agent isolated or semisynthesized from a living source, as opposed to a totally synthesized drug. This would include blood and blood components, vaccines, and antibodies. However, the term is now mainly used to mean agents produced for clinical use by *genetic engineering, such as *interferon, *interleukin, *monoclonal antibodies, and *cytokine inhibitors. Such products are often referred to as biologics. See also biological therapy; biosimilar; biotechnology.

biophysical profile a physiological assessment of fetal wellbeing, based on scores for each of the following: fetal breathing, fetal movement, fetal tone, and *amniotic fluid volume (as observed on ultrasound) and fetal heart rate (measured by *cardiotocography). The maximum score is 10 (with 2 points for each component).

biopsy n. the removal of a small piece of living tissue from an organ or part of the body for microscopic examination. Biopsy is an important means of diagnosing cancer from examination of a fragment of tumour. It is often carried out with a special hollow needle, inserted into the liver, kidney, or other organ, with relatively little discomfort to the patient.

biosimilar n. a *biopharmaceutical (biologic) created to be very similar to a product already approved for clinical use whose patent has expired. Owing to their molecular complexity, it is not possible to produce identical (generic) versions of biological products. However, a growing number of biosimilars have been approved since the mid-2000s on the basis that they have no clinically meaningful differences from the original product.

biostatistics n. the application of statistical techniques to studies in biology, especially in the fields of medicine and public health. The term embraces, and is to some extent synonymous with, vital statistics (e.g. *fertility and *mortality rates) and *demography.

biotechnology n. the development of techniques for the application of biological processes to the production of materials of use in medicine and industry. For example, the production of many antibiotics relies on the activity of various fungi and bacteria. Recent techniques of *genetic engineering, in which human genes are cloned in bacterial cells, have enabled the large-scale production of hormones (notably insulin), vaccines, interferon, and other useful products.

biotin n. a vitamin of the B complex that is an essential coenzyme for several carboxylase enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, *gluconeogenesis, and the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. A biotin deficiency is extremely rare in humans; it can be induced by eating large quantities of raw egg white, which contains a protein – avidin – that combines with biotin, making it unavailable to the body. Rich sources of the vitamin are egg yolk and liver. There are no known reports of biotin toxicity.

BiPAP (bi-level positive airways pressure) trade name for a device that provides ventilation for patients by delivering air to the lungs at two levels of pressure, either cyclically in an anaesthetized patient or triggered by the patient’s attempts at breathing when awake. The higher pressure inflates the lungs to whatever volume can safely be achieved, while the lower pressure enables controlled exhalation against a resistance: this minimizes *atelectasis, a risk with conventional positive-pressure ventilators, which allow exhalation against zero resistance (by opening a valve in the device). Although BiPAP is a trade name, it is now widely used generically for this type of ventilation (or ventilator). There are also other devices that utilize the same principle, for example vPAP (variable positive airways pressure).

biparietal diameter the ultrasound measurement used to assess gestational age of a fetus between 13 and 22 weeks. It is the distance between the upper edge of the proximal parietal bone and the upper edge of the distal one, i.e. the greatest transverse diameter of the fetal skull.

biphasic defibrillator see defibrillator.

bipolar adj. (in neurology) describing a neuron (nerve cell) that has two processes extending in different directions from its cell body.

bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) a severe mental illness affecting about 1% of the population and causing repeated episodes of *depression, *mania, and/or *mixed affective state. Type I BPAD consists equally of depressive and manic episodes, whereas Type II BPAD consists primarily of depressive episodes with occasional phases of *hypomania. Treatment is that of the individual episode. Antidepressants and antipsychotics are used to treat depressive episodes together with mood stabilizers (e.g. *lithium) or antiepileptics. Mood stabilizers are also used to prevent or lessen future episodes. Mania is most commonly treated with benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. ECT may be used for either episode in severe cases. To prevent future episodes many patients need combinations of mood stabilizers with *antidepressant or *antipsychotic medication. Certain types of educational *psychotherapy can be used to prevent relapse as well as to treat the individual episode. Up to 50% of BPAD patients have substance abuse problems, and many suffer from residual mood symptoms between episodes.

BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) a standardized system of terminology, report organization, assessment, and classification for mammography and ultrasound or MRI of the breast. BI-RADS reporting enables radiologists to communicate results to the referring physician clearly and consistently, with a final assessment and specific management recommendations.

The success of BI-RADS has inspired several other systems of the same kind: TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System); LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System); and PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System).

bird-fancier’s lung a form of extrinsic allergic *alveolitis caused by the inhalation of avian proteins present in the droppings and feathers of certain birds, especially pigeons and caged birds (such as budgerigars). As in *farmer’s lung, there is an acute and a chronic form.

bird flu see avian influenza.

Its introduction in the Western world followed the increasing demand by women for greater mobility during labour. The chair is electronically powered and can be tilted back quickly and easily should the need arise.

birthmark n. a skin blemish or mark present at birth. The cause is unknown but most birthmarks grow before the baby is born. See naevus.

birth rate the number of live births occurring in a year per 1000 total population (the crude birth rate). See fertility rate.

bisacodyl n. a stimulant *laxative that acts on the large intestine to cause reflex movement and bowel evacuation. The commonest side-effect is the development of abdominal cramps.

bisexual adj. 1. describing an individual who is sexually attracted to both men and women. 2. describing an individual who possesses the qualities of both sexes.

Bismarck brown a basic aniline dye used for staining and counterstaining histological and bacterial specimens. [O. von Bismarck (1815–98), German statesman]

bisoprolol n. a cardioselective *beta blocker used to treat angina pectoris, hypertension, and heart failure. Possible side-effects include breathing difficulty, fatigue, cold extremities, and sleep disturbances.

bisphosphonates pl. n. a class of drugs that inhibit the resorption of bone by blocking the action of *osteoclasts. This property makes them useful for treating certain bone disorders, such as Paget’s disease and osteoporosis, as well as malignant disease – both in terms of pain relief and in treating hypercalcaemia due to cancer. There is a risk of *osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients receiving bisphosphonates for cancer. This risk is increased by tooth extraction. Bisphosphonates include *alendronic acid, etidronate, *pamidronate disodium, risedronate, clodronate, and *zoledronic acid.

bistoury n. a narrow surgical knife, with a straight or curved blade.

bite-raiser n. an appliance to prevent normal closure of the teeth in orthodontic treatment and in the treatment of *temporomandibular joint syndrome.

bite-wing n. a dental X-ray film that provides a view of the crowns of the teeth together with the alveolar bone in part of both upper and lower jaws. This view is used in the diagnosis of caries and periodontal disease (where alveolar bone does not appear on the bite-wing this indicates loss of bony support).

Bitot’s spots cheesy foamy greyish spots that form on the surface of dry patches of conjunctiva at the sides of the eyes. They consist of fragments of keratinized epithelium. A common cause is vitamin A deficiency. [P. A. Bitot (1822–88), French physician]

bivalent n. (in genetics) a structure consisting of homologous chromosomes attached to each other by *chiasmata during the first division of *meiosis. —bivalent adj.

bivalirudin n. see hirudin.

Black Death see plague.

black eye bruising of the eyelids.

black fly a small widely distributed bloodsucking insect of the genus Simulium. Black flies are also known as buffalo gnats from their humpbacked appearance. Female flies can inflict painful bites and constitute a serious pest at certain times of the year. S. damnosum in Africa and S. ochraceum in Central America and Venezuela transmit the parasites causing *onchocerciasis.

black hairy tongue (BHT) a harmless condition characterized by the appearance of elongated filiform *papillae on the upper surface of the tongue. The usual cause is an overgrowth of bacteria that accumulate on the papillae and create pigments giving the tongue a black appearance. Known predisposing factors include smoking, excessive consumption of tea and/or coffee, poor oral hygiene, trigeminal *neuralgia, and *dry mouth.

blackhead n. a plug formed of fatty material (sebum and keratin) in the outlet of a *sebaceous gland in the skin; the black colour is due to *melanin. See also acne. Medical name: comedo.

black heel a black area, sometimes called a ‘talon noir’, resulting from the rupture of capillaries in the skin in those who play basketball, squash, etc. It may be mistaken for malignant melanoma.

blackwater fever a rare and serious complication of malignant (falciparum) *malaria in which there is massive destruction of the red blood cells, leading to the presence of the blood pigment haemoglobin in the urine. The condition is probably brought on by inadequate treatment with *quinine; it is marked by fever, bloody urine, jaundice, vomiting, enlarged liver and spleen, anaemia, exhaustion, and – in fatal cases – a reduced flow of urine resulting from a blockage of the kidney tubules. Treatment involves rest, administration of alkaline fluids and intravenous glucose, and blood transfusions.

bladder n. 1. (urinary bladder) a sac-shaped organ that has a wall of smooth muscle and stores the urine produced by the kidneys. Urine passes into the bladder through the *ureters; the release of urine from the bladder is controlled by a sphincter at its junction with the *urethra. The bladder neck is the outlet of the bladder where it joins the urethra and in males it is in contact with the *prostate gland; it is under the control of the autonomic nerves of the pelvis. The neck of the bladder is the commonest site for *retention of urine, usually by an enlarged prostate or a urethral *stricture. See also detrusor. 2. any of several other hollow organs containing fluid, such as the *gall bladder.

bladder augmentation (bladder enhancement) a surgical method of increasing the capacity of the bladder to provide a safe, functional, and low-pressure storage reservoir for urine. This is usually achieved by ileocystoplasty or ileocaecocystoplasty (see cystoplasty).

bladder neck incision an operation that involves an incision through the bladder neck that is extended into the prostate to relieve *lower urinary tract symptoms. This procedure is usually performed under a general or spinal anaesthetic through a cystoscope. It is not as extensive as a transurethral resection of the prostate and is therefore associated with a comparatively lower incidence of side-effects.

bladder pressure study a combined X-ray and manometry examination of the bladder to look for abnormal function. The bladder is filled slowly with contrast medium using a small urinary catheter and the pressure is monitored during filling and voiding (micturition). X-ray images of the bladder and urethra (see urethrography) are taken. The test is used to differentiate between obstruction to bladder outflow and abnormal involuntary contractions of the muscle in the bladder wall.

bladder replacement see cystectomy.

bladderworm n. see cysticercus.

blast n. an important cause of serious soft-tissue injury that is associated with explosions or high-velocity missiles. The eardrums, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are especially vulnerable to the indirect effects of the blast wave.

-blast combining form denoting a formative cell. Example: osteoblast (formative bone cell).

blastema n. any zone of embryonic tissue that is still differentiating and growing into a particular organ. The term is usually applied to the tissue that develops into the kidneys and gonads.

blasto- combining form denoting a germ cell or embryo. Example: blastogenesis (early development of an embryo).

blastocoele n. the fluid-filled cavity that develops within the *blastocyst. The cavity increases the surface area of the embryo and thus improves its ability to absorb nutrients and oxygen.

blastocyst n. an early stage of embryonic development that consists of a hollow ball of cells with a localized thickening (the inner cell mass) that will develop into the actual embryo; the remainder of the blastocyst is composed of *trophoblast (see illustration). At first the blastocyst is unattached, but it soon implants in the wall of the uterus. See also implantation.

Section through a blastocyst.





blastomere n. any of the cells produced by *cleavage of the zygote, comprising the earliest stages of embryonic development until the formation of the *blastocyst. Blastomeres divide repeatedly without growth and so decrease in size.

blastomycosis n. any disease caused by parasitic fungi of the genus Blastomyces, which may affect the skin (forming wartlike ulcers and tumours on the face, neck, hands, arms, feet, and legs) or involve various internal tissues, such as the lungs, bones, liver, spleen, and lymphatics. There are two principal forms of the disease: North American blastomycosis (Gilchrist’s disease), caused by B. dermatitidis; and South American blastomycosis, caused by B. brasiliensis. Both diseases are treated with antifungal drugs (such as amphotericin).

blastopore n. the opening that forms as a result of invagination of the surface layer of the early embryo (*gastrula). It is very much reduced in humans, in which it gives rise to the archenteric canal (see archenteron).

blastula n. an early stage of the embryonic development of many animals. The equivalent stage in mammals (including humans) is the *blastocyst.

bleaching (tooth whitening) n. (in dentistry) a procedure to lighten the colour of teeth. Internal bleaching involves placing chemicals within an existing cavity in a discoloured tooth that has had *root canal treatment. External bleaching involves placing chemicals on the tooth surface.

bleb n. a blister or large vesicle. A filtering bleb is a blister-like cyst underneath the conjunctiva resulting from a surgical procedure such as *trabeculectomy, used in the treatment of glaucoma.

bleeding n. see haemorrhage.

blenn- (blenno-) combining form denoting mucus. Example: blennorrhagia (excessive production of).

blennorrhagia n. a copious discharge of mucus, particularly from the urethra. This usually accompanies *urethritis and sometimes occurs with acute *prostatitis. Treatment is directed to clearing the underlying causative organism by antibiotic administration.

blennorrhoea n. a profuse watery discharge from the urethra. This, like *blennorrhagia, is associated with either prostatitis or urethritis, and is cleared by the usual measures undertaken in the treatment of these conditions.

bleomycin n. an antibiotic with action against cancer cells (see cytotoxic drug), used in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, germ-cell cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It can cause toxic side-effects in the skin and lungs.

blephar- (blepharo-) combining form denoting the eyelid. Example: blepharotomy (incision into).

blepharitis n. inflammation of the eyelids. In squamous blepharitis, often associated with dandruff of the scalp, white scales accumulate among the eyelashes. Chronic ulcerative blepharitis is characterized by yellow crusts overlying ulcers of the lid margins. The lashes become matted together and tend to fall out or become distorted. Allergic blepharitis may occur in response to drugs or cosmetics put in the eye or on the eyelids.

blepharochalasis n. excessive eyelid skin resulting from recurrent episodes of oedema and inflammation of the eyelid. It occurs in young people, causing drooping of the lid. Compare dermatochalasis.

blepharoconjunctivitis n. inflammation involving the eyelid margins and conjunctiva.

blepharon n. see eyelid.

blepharophimosis n. a small aperture between the eyelids. It is usually congenital.

blepharoptosis n. see ptosis.

blepharospasm n. involuntary tight contraction of the eyelids, either in response to painful conditions of the eye or as a form of *dystonia.

blind loop syndrome (stagnant loop syndrome) a condition of stasis of the small intestine that alters the normal bacterial flora of the gut, leading to *malabsorption, nutrient deficiency, and the passage of fatty stools (see steatorrhoea). It is usually a result of chronic obstruction (resulting, for example, from *Crohn’s disease, a *stricture, or intestinal tuberculosis), or surgical bypass operations producing a stagnant length of bowel, or conditions (e.g. a jejunal *diverticulum) in which a segment of intestine is out of continuity with the rest.

blind and partially sighted register (in Britain) an incomplete list of persons who are technically blind or partially sighted due to reduced visual acuity, or who have severely restricted fields of vision (see blindness). Registration is voluntary, but it is a precondition for the receipt of some financial benefits. The list is maintained by local authorities (England and Wales), regional or island councils (in Scotland), or the Health and Social Care Board (Northern Ireland).

blindness n. the inability to see. Lack of all light perception constitutes total blindness but there are degrees of visual impairment far less severe than this that may be classed as blindness for administrative or statutory purposes. For example, marked reduction in the *visual field is classified as blindness, even if objects are still seen sharply. The commonest causes of blindness worldwide are *trachoma, *onchocerciasis, and vitamin A deficiency (see night blindness) but there is wide geographic variation. In Great Britain the commonest causes are age-related *macular degeneration, *glaucoma, *cataract, myopic retinal degeneration, and diabetic *retinopathy.

blind spot the small area of the *retina of the eye where the nerve fibres from the light-sensitive cells (see cone; rod) lead into the optic nerve. There are no rods or cones in this area and hence it does not register light. Anatomical name: punctum caecum.

blind trial see intervention study.

blinking n. the action of closing and opening the eyelids, which wipes the front of the eyeball and helps to spread the *tears. Reflex blinking may be caused by suddenly bringing an object near to the eye: the eyelids close involuntarily in order to protect the eye.

blister n. a swelling containing watery fluid (serum) and sometimes also blood (blood blister) or pus, within or just beneath the skin. Blisters commonly develop as a result of unaccustomed friction on the hands or feet or at the site of a burn but are also a feature of certain skin diseases. Blisters may be treated with antiseptics and dressings. An unduly painful blister may be punctured with a sterile needle so that the fluid is released.

bloating n. the subjective experience of abdominal fullness, often (but not always) accompanied by abdominal distension. Its many causes include air swallowing (*aerophagia), abnormal intestinal gas handling or abdominal wall reflexes, increased gas production, and organ hypersensitivity. Bloating may be associated with increased belching, excessive flatus, or changes in bowel habit, particularly constipation. It tends to be aggravated by meals, fluctuates in severity throughout the day (with particular discomfort in the evening), and is relieved at night. Treatment includes the removal of exacerbating factors (such as specific dietary products), avoidance of carbonated drinks and fat-rich diets, reduction in dietary fibre, and reassurance. Drug therapy has limited efficacy, but antispasmodics, laxatives, peppermint oil, simeticone, prokinetics (such as domperidone), nonabsorbable antibiotics (rifaximin), and tricyclic antidepressants (to reduce hypersensitivity) may be tried.

block n. any interruption of physiological or mental function, brought about intentionally (as part of a therapeutic procedure) or by disease. See also heart block; nerve block.

blocking n. (in psychiatry) the failure to recall a specific event, or to explore a specific train of thought, because of its unpleasant associations.

Blocq’s disease see abasia.

blood n. a fluid that circulates throughout the body, via the arteries and veins, providing a vehicle by which an immense variety of different substances are transported between the various organs and tissues. It is composed of *blood cells, which are suspended in a liquid medium, the *plasma. An average individual has approximately 70 ml of blood per kilogram body weight (about 5 litres in an average adult male). See Appendix 2.

blood bank a department within a hospital or blood transfusion centre in which blood collected from donors is stored prior to transfusion. Blood must be kept at a temperature of 4°C and may be used up to four weeks after collection.

blood-brain barrier the mechanism that controls the passage of molecules from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid and the tissue spaces surrounding the cells of the brain. The endothelial cells lining the walls of the brain capillaries are more tightly joined together at their edges than those lining capillaries supplying other parts of the body. This allows the passage of solutions and fat-soluble compounds but excludes particles and large molecules. The importance of the blood-brain barrier is that it protects the brain from the effect of many substances harmful to it. A disadvantage, however, is that many useful drugs pass only in small amounts into the brain, and much larger doses may have to be given than normal. Brain cancer, for example, is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, although drugs such as diazepam, alcohol, and fat-soluble general anaesthetics pass readily and quickly to the brain cells.

blood cell (blood corpuscle) any of the cells that are present in the blood in health or disease. The cells may be subclassified into three major categories, namely red cells (*erythrocytes); white cells (*leucocytes), which include granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes; and *platelets (see illustration). The blood cells account for approximately 40% of the total volume of the blood in health; red cells comprise the vast majority.

Types of blood cells.





blood clot a solid or semisolid mass formed as the result of *blood coagulation, either within the blood vessels and heart after death or elsewhere in the body during life (a mass of coagulated blood formed in the cardiovascular system during life is called a thrombus: see thrombosis). A blood clot consists of a meshwork of the protein *fibrin in which various blood cells are trapped.

blood clotting see blood coagulation.

blood coagulation (blood clotting) the process whereby blood is converted from a liquid to a solid state. The process may be initiated by contact of blood with a foreign surface (intrinsic system) or with damaged tissue (extrinsic system). These systems involve the interaction of a variety of substances (*coagulation factors) and lead to the production of the enzyme thrombin, which converts the soluble blood protein *fibrinogen to the insoluble protein *fibrin, forming the blood clot. Finally, fibrin is broken down by the action of *plasmin. Anticoagulants and tissue plasminogen activators act by inhibiting or activating various pathways in this cascade (see illustration). Blood coagulation is an essential mechanism for the arrest of bleeding (*haemostasis). See also platelet activation.

Blood coagulation. The clotting cascade showing sites of action of anticoagulants and tissue-type plasminogen activators.





blood corpuscle see blood cell.

blood count the numbers of different blood cells in a known volume of blood, usually expressed as the number of cells per litre. A sample of blood at known dilution is passed through a narrow opening in an electronic counting device. Blood-count investigations are important in the diagnosis of blood diseases. See also differential leucocyte count.

blood donor a person who gives blood for storage in a *blood bank. The blood can then be used for *transfusion into another patient. In Britain collection is organized by NHS Blood and Transplant, but the armed forces have their own services. See also blood group.

blood group any one of the many types into which a person’s blood may be classified, based on the presence or absence of certain inherited antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. Blood of one group contains antibodies in the serum that react against the cells of other groups.

There are more than 30 blood group systems, one of the most important of which is the ABO system. This system is based on the presence or absence of antigens A and B: blood of groups A and B contains antigens A and B, respectively; group AB contains both antigens and group O neither. Blood of group A contains antibodies to antigen B; group B blood contains anti-A antibodies or *isoagglutinins; group AB has neither antibody and group O has both. A person whose blood contains either (or both) of these antibodies cannot receive a transfusion of blood containing the corresponding antigens. The table illustrates which blood groups can be used in transfusion for each of the four groups.

Blood group

Donor’s blood group Blood group of people donor can receive blood from Blood group of people donor can give blood to

A A, O A, AB

B B, O B, AB

AB A, B, AB, O AB

O O A, B, AB, O



blood plasma see plasma.

blood poisoning the presence of either bacterial toxins or large numbers of bacteria in the bloodstream causing serious illness. See pyaemia; septicaemia; toxaemia.

blood pressure the pressure of blood against the walls of the main arteries. Pressure is highest during *systole, when the ventricles are contracting (systolic pressure), and lowest during *diastole, when the ventricles are relaxing and refilling (diastolic pressure). Blood pressure is measured – in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) – by means of a *sphygmomanometer at the brachial artery of the arm, where the pressure is most similar to that of blood leaving the heart. The normal range varies with age, but a young adult would be expected to have a systolic pressure of around 120 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mmHg at rest. These are recorded as 120/80 mmHg.

Individual variations are common. Muscular exertion and emotional factors, such as fear, stress, and excitement, all raise systolic blood pressure (see hypertension). Systolic blood pressure is normally at its lowest during sleep. Severe shock may lead to an abnormally low blood pressure and possible circulatory failure (see hypotension). Blood pressure is adjusted to its normal level by the *sympathetic nervous system and hormonal controls.

blood serum see serum.

blood sugar the concentration of glucose in the blood, normally expressed in millimoles per litre. The normal range is 3.5–5.5 mmol/l. Blood-sugar estimation is an important investigation in a variety of diseases, most notably in diabetes mellitus. See also hyperglycaemia; hypoglycaemia.

blood test any test designed to discover abnormalities in a sample of a person’s blood, such as the presence of alcohol, drugs, or bacteria, or to determine the *blood group.

blood transfusion see transfusion.

blood vessel a tube carrying blood away from or towards the heart. Blood vessels are the means by which blood circulates throughout the body. See artery; arteriole; vein; venule; capillary.

Bloom’s syndrome a specific abnormality of chromosome 15 in which the individual suffers from recurrent infections, blisters on the hands and lips, and poor growth. Such children have a much higher than normal risk of developing cancer. [D. Bloom (20th century), US dermatologist]

Blount disease a condition causing *bow-legs as a result of abnormal growth at the *epiphysis at the top of the tibia (shin bone). It is more common in Africans and is most noticeable in childhood. The condition may affect one or both legs, and affected children are often obese. Treatment depends upon the severity and the age of the child but usually involves surgery. [W. P. Blount (1900–92), US orthopaedic surgeon]

blue baby a colloquial name, becoming obsolete, for an infant suffering from congenital cyanotic heart disease, the commonest forms of which are *tetralogy of Fallot and *transposition of the great vessels, in which the circulation is misdirected. Both of these conditions result in the presence of partially deoxygenated blood (which is blue in colour) in the peripheral circulation, which gives the skin and lips a characteristic purple colour. Surgical correction is often possible at an early stage. If untreated, infants may survive months or years with persistent *cyanosis.

blue bloater the characteristic appearance of a patient suffering from heart failure as a result of *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, marked by *cyanosis, oedema, and breathlessness at rest. The left ventricle of the heart is enlarged (see cor pulmonale).

B lymphocyte n. see lymphocyte.

B-Lynch brace suture a technique in which a compression suture is applied to the uterus, which can be used in cases of severe *postpartum haemorrhage as an alternative to an emergency hysterectomy. A pair of vertical sutures are inserted around the uterus to appose the anterior and posterior walls and to apply continuous compression, which stems the bleeding. [C. Balogun-Lynch (21st century), British obstetrician and gynaecologist]

BMA see British Medical Association.

BMI see body mass index.

BMS see burning mouth syndrome.

BNF see British National Formulary.

BNP brain *natriuretic peptide.

Boari flap a tube of bladder tissue constructed to replace the lower third of the ureter when this has been injured or surgically excised because of the presence of a tumour or stricture. See also ureteroplasty. [A. Boari (19th century), Italian surgeon]

Boas’s sign increased or altered sensitivity in the region of the wing of the right scapula, associated with acute *cholecystitis. [I. I. Boas (1858–1938), German gastroenterologist]

boceprevir n. a *protease inhibitor used, in combination with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Telaprevir is a related drug with the same use.

body n. 1. an entire animal organism. 2. the trunk of an individual, excluding the limbs. 3. the main or largest part of an organ (such as the stomach or uterus). 4. a solid discrete mass of tissue; e.g. the carotid body. See also corpus.

body dysmorphic disorder a fixed distressing belief that one’s body or part of one’s body is deformed, or an irrational fear that it might become so. Previously known as dysmorphophobia, it is usually considered to be a phobic rather than a delusional disorder. Treatment consists of cognitive behavioural therapy and occasionally SSRIs.

body image (body schema) the individual’s concept of the disposition of his limbs and the identity of the different parts of his body. It is a function of the *association areas of the brain. See also Gerstmann’s syndrome.

body mass index (BMI) the weight of a person (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height of that person (in metres): used as an indicator of whether or not a person is over- or underweight. For example, a person who is 1.7 m tall and weighs 65 kg has a BMI of 65/1.72 = 22.5. A BMI of between 20 and 25 is considered normal, between 25 and 30 is overweight, and greater than 30 indicates clinical *obesity. A BMI of less than 20 is considered underweight. A limitation of the BMI is that it cannot distinguish whether the weight is due to muscle or fat. BMI is not a valid metric in individuals with an altered body structure, as through physical disability. See also waist to hip ratio.

body temperature the temperature of the body, as measured by a thermometer. Body temperature is accurately controlled by a small area at the base of the brain (the *hypothalamus); in normal individuals it is maintained at about 37°C (98.4°F). Heat production by the body arises as the result of vital activities (e.g. respiration, heartbeat, circulation, secretion) and from the muscular effort of exercise and shivering. A rise in body temperature occurs in fever.

body type (somatotype) the characteristic anatomical appearance of an individual, based on the predominance of the structures derived from the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm). The three types are described as *ectomorphic, *mesomorphic, and *endomorphic.

Boeck’s disease see sarcoidosis. [C. P. M. Boeck (1845–1913), Norwegian dermatologist]

Boerhaave’s syndrome spontaneous rupture (see perforation) of the gullet (oesophagus) following forceful retching and vomiting. Usual symptoms are severe chest and upper abdominal pain (that is aggravated by swallowing), fever, and shortness of breath. Surgical *emphysema is often present. Diagnosis is usually made with CT scanning. Surgery is required in most of the cases, combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics and parenteral *nutrition. [H. Boerhaave (1668–1738), Dutch physician]

boil n. a tender inflamed area of the skin containing pus. The infection is usually caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus entering through a hair follicle or a break in the skin, and local injury or lowered constitutional resistance may encourage the development of boils. Boils usually heal when the pus is released or with antibiotic treatment, though occasionally they may cause more widespread infection. Medical name: furuncle.

Bolam and Bolitho tests where clinical *negligence is claimed, tests used to determine the standard of care owed by professionals to those whom they serve, e.g. the standards of care provided to patients by doctors. The 1957 case of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee established that if a doctor acts in accordance with a responsible body of medical opinion, he or she will not be negligent. In 1997 this standard of care test was amended by the case of Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority, which requires the doctor’s behaviour to satisfy the judgment not only of responsible medical opinion but also of a court’s own independent logical analysis.

bolus n. 1. a soft mass of chewed food. 2. a large dose of a drug administered by rapid injection, as opposed to infusion.

bonding n. 1. (in psychology) the development of a close and selective relationship, such as that of *attachment. Mother–child bonding is the supposed process that starts with physical contact between mother and child in the child’s first hours of life and continues throughout childhood. It promotes the mother’s loving and caring for her baby as well as the child’s sense of security. 2. (in dentistry) the attachment of dental restorations, sealants, and orthodontic brackets to teeth. Bonding may be mechanical (see acid-etch technique) or chemical, by the use of adhesive *cements or resins. Dentine bonding agents are increasingly used to attach dental fillings to dentine as well as to enamel. In certain artificial *crowns porcelain is bonded to a metal substructure to produce a bonded porcelain crown.

bone n. the hard extremely dense connective tissue that forms the skeleton of the body. It is composed of a matrix of collagen fibres impregnated with bone salts (chiefly calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate; see hydroxyapatite), in which are embedded bone cells (see osteocyte). Compact (or cortical) bone forms the outer shell of bones; it consists of a hard virtually solid mass made up of bony tissue arranged in concentric layers (Haversian systems). Spongy (or cancellous) bone, found beneath compact bone, consists of a meshwork of bony bars (trabeculae) with many interconnecting spaces containing marrow. (See illustration overleaf.)

Bone. Section of the shaft of a long bone (above) with detail of single Haversian system (below).





Individual bones may be classed as long, short, flat, or irregular. The outer layer of a bone is called the *periosteum. The medullary cavity is lined with *endosteum and contains the marrow. Bones not only form the skeleton but also act as stores for mineral salts and play an important part in the formation of blood cells.

bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) a specialized form of *hearing aid for patients with certain forms of conductive *deafness. A small titanium screw is surgically fixed into the bone of the skull behind the external ear using a process called *osseointegration. Sound energy is passed from a miniature microphone and amplifier to the screw, through the bone, to the *cochlea.

bone graft the use of bone or a bonelike synthetic substance to fill a bony defect or to augment bone formation. Bone grafts are usually *autografts or *allografts, but synthetic bone grafts, using calcium compounds and hydroxyapatite, are increasingly being used. Hard cortical bone can be used to replace structural defects, softer cancellous bone is used to fill voids or to encourage bony union, and synthetic bone grafts act as a scaffold through which normal bony healing can occur.

bone growth factors a group of *growth factors that promote new bone formation. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP), a naturally occurring substance that induces *osteoblast formation, has been genetically synthesized to form bone morphogenetic protein, which stimulates new bone formation and assists with fracture healing. Other bone growth factors include a type of transforming growth factor (TGFβ) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), which encourage collagen formation.

bone marrow (marrow) the tissue contained within the internal cavities of the bones. At birth, these cavities are filled entirely with blood-forming myeloid tissue (red marrow) but in later life the marrow in the limb bones is replaced by fat (yellow marrow). Samples of bone marrow may be obtained for examination by *aspiration through a stout needle or by *trephine biopsy. See also haemopoiesis.

bone scan an imaging investigation of a patient’s bone using radioactive *tracers. *Technetium-99m phosphate is injected intravenously and absorbed into the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone. It concentrates in areas of increased blood flow and metabolism, such as areas of infection, trauma, and *neoplasia, and gives off radiation that can be detected by a *gamma camera, thereby producing a map or scan of activity in the target area. A bone scan is particularly useful in the diagnosis of subtle fractures (including stress fractures), avascular necrosis (see osteonecrosis), osteomyelitis, tumour spread (metastasis), and loosening of orthopaedic implants.

bony labyrinth see labyrinth.

BOO (bladder outlet obstruction) a condition in which urine flow from the bladder through the urethra is impeded. It is usually caused by an enlarged *prostate gland but also by a high bladder neck or uncoordinated contraction of the urinary sphincter and detrusor muscle of the bladder.

BOOI bladder outlet obstruction index: see Abrams-Griffiths number.

BOOP see bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.

borborygmus n. (pl. borborygmi) an abdominal gurgling sound due to movement of fluid and gas in the intestine. Excessive borborygmi can occur when intestinal movement is increased, for example in the *irritable bowel syndrome and in intestinal obstruction, or when there is more intestinal gas than normal.

borderline adj. 1. denoting a type of *personality disorder, known as *emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type in ICD-11 and borderline personality disorder in DSM-5. 2. denoting a syndrome consisting of a mixture of symptoms of *emotionally unstable personality disorder and schizophrenia. Borderline syndrome was first defined by Eckhart Tölle in the 1980s.

Bordetella n. a genus of tiny Gram-negative aerobic bacteria. B. pertussis causes *whooping cough, and all the other species are able to break down red blood cells and cause diseases resembling whooping cough.

borneol n. an essential oil used, in preparations with other essential oils, such as camphene, cineole, and pinene, to disperse gallstones and kidney stones.

Bornholm disease (devil’s grip, epidemic myalgia, epidemic pleurodynia) a disease caused by *Coxsackie viruses, named after the Danish island where the first documented cases occurred. It is spread by contact and epidemics usually occur during warm weather in temperate regions and at any time in the tropics. Symptoms include fever, headache, and attacks of severe pain in the lower chest. The illness lasts about a week and is rarely fatal. There is no specific treatment.

Borrelia n. a genus of large parasitic *spirochaete bacteria. Various species, transmitted by lice or ticks, cause *relapsing fever; the species B. burgdorferi, transmitted by ticks, causes *Lyme disease.

bortezomib n. a *cytotoxic drug that works by inhibiting *proteasomes and causing death of malignant cells. It is used alone in the treatment of relapsed myeloma and in combination with other agents for the first-line treatment of myeloma. Side-effects include *peripheral neuropathy, *thrombocytopenia, and nausea.

bosentan n. see endothelin.

Bosniak classification a system for classifying renal cysts seen on CT imaging to aid in determining their degree of malignancy.

Type I: a benign cyst with smooth margins and no calcification or septa that does not enhance with contrast material.

Type II: a benign cyst with a few hairline septa and/or minimal calcification that does not enhance with contrast.

Type IIF: a cyst with more septa and increased calcification but no contrast enhancement.

Type III: a complicated cyst with irregular margins, moderate calcification, thick septa, and contrast enhancement.

Type IV: a malignant cyst with irregular margins and solid enhancing elements.





bottom shuffling a normal variant of crawling in which babies sit upright and move on their bottoms, usually by pulling forward on their heels. Babies who bottom-shuffle tend to walk slightly later. There is often a family history of bottom shuffling.

botulinum toxin a powerful nerve toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, that has proved effective, in minute dosage, for the treatment of various conditions of muscle dysfunction, such as dystonic conditions (see dystonia), including *torticollis and spasm of the orbicularis muscle in patients with *blepharospasm, and spastic paralysis associated with cerebral palsy and stroke. It is also used for the treatment of severe *hyperhidrosis and the prevention of chronic migraine headaches. The toxin may also be used to treat *achalasia, being injected through an endoscope into the gastro-oesophageal sphincter, and is used in the bladder to treat urinary incontinence due to *detrusor overactivity (as in multiple sclerosis) that is resistant to other treatments. Side-effects include prolonged local muscle paralysis. Under the trade names Botox and Dysport it is widely used for the cosmetic treatment of facial wrinkles.

botulism n. a rare and potentially life-threatening form of *food poisoning due to ingestion of foods contaminated with toxins produced by the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin selectively targets motor nerve fibres of the central nervous system, causing flaccid paralysis. As the disease progresses, involvement of the muscles of respiration leads to respiratory failure and death. The bacterium thrives in improperly preserved foods, typically canned raw meats. The toxins are unstable to heat and are invariably destroyed during cooking.

Bouchard’s node a bony thickening arising at the proximal interphalangeal joint of a finger in osteoarthritis. It is often found together with *Heberden’s nodes. [J. C. Bouchard (1837–1915), French physician]

bougie n. a hollow or solid cylindrical instrument, usually flexible, that is inserted into tubular passages, such as the oesophagus (gullet), rectum, or urethra. Bougies are used in diagnosis and treatment, particularly by enlarging *stricture(s) (for example, in the urethra).

Bourneville’s disease see tuberous sclerosis. [D.-M. Bourneville (1840–1909), French neurologist]

boutonnière deformity (buttonhole deformity) a deformity seen in a finger when the central strand of the tendon of the extensor muscle of the digits is ruptured. This results in marked flexion of the middle phalanx across the proximal interphalangeal joint and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint.

bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) see spongiform encephalopathy.

bowel n. see intestine.

Bowen’s disease a type of in-situ carcinoma of the squamous epidermal cells of the skin that does not spread to the basal layers. It can mimic psoriasis clinically. [J. T. Bowen (1857–1941), US dermatologist]

bow-legs pl. n. abnormal out-curving of the legs, resulting in a gap between the knees on standing. A certain degree of bowing is normal in small children, but persistence into adult life, or later development of this deformity, results from abnormal growth of the *epiphysis or arthritis. The condition can be corrected by *osteotomy. Medical name: genu varum.

Bowman’s capsule the cup-shaped end of a *nephron, which encloses a knot of blood capillaries (glomerulus). It is the site of primary filtration of the blood into the kidney tubule. [Sir W. P. Bowman (1816–92), British physician]

BPAD see bipolar affective disorder.

BPH benign prostatic hyperplasia. See prostate gland.

BPPV see benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

brachi- (brachio-) combining form denoting the arm. Example: brachialgia (pain in).

brachial adj. relating to or affecting the arm.

brachial artery an artery that extends from the axillary artery, at the armpit, down the side and inner surface of the upper arm to the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries.

brachialis n. a muscle that is situated at the front of the upper arm and contracts to flex the forearm (see illustration). It works against the triceps brachii.

Brachialis and triceps muscles.





brachial plexus a network of nerves, arising from the spine at the base of the neck, from which arise the nerves supplying the arm, forearm and hand, and parts of the shoulder girdle (see illustration). See also radial nerve.

The brachial plexus.





brachiocephalic artery see innominate artery.

brachium n. (pl. brachia) the arm, especially the part of the arm between the shoulder and the elbow.

brachy- combining form denoting shortness. Example: brachydactylia (shortness of the fingers or toes).

brachycephaly n. shortness of the skull, with a *cephalic index of about 80. —brachycephalic adj.

brachytherapy n. radiotherapy administered by implanting a radioactive source into or close to a tumour. This technique is used in the treatment of many accessible tumours (e.g. gynaecological cancers) and is increasingly used in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Intravascular brachytherapy has been used to prevent *restenosis in stented coronary arteries but this technique has been obviated by the introduction of drug-eluting *stents.

bracket n. (in dentistry) the component of a fixed *orthodontic appliance that is bonded to the tooth.

brady- combining form denoting slowness. Example: bradylalia (abnormally slow speech).

bradyarrhythmia n. see arrhythmia.

bradycardia n. slowing of the heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute. Sinus bradycardia is often found in healthy individuals, especially athletes, but it is also seen in some patients with reduced thyroid activity, jaundice, hypothermia, or *vasovagal attacks. Bradycardia may also result from *arrhythmias, especially complete *heart block, when the slowing is often extreme and often causes loss of consciousness.

bradykinesia n. a symptom of *parkinsonism comprising a difficulty in initiating movements and slowness in executing movements.

bradykinin n. a naturally occurring polypeptide consisting of nine amino acids. Bradykinin is a very powerful vasodilator and causes contraction of smooth muscle; it is formed in the blood under certain conditions and is thought to play an important role as a mediator of inflammation. See kinin.

braille n. an alphabet, developed by Louis Braille (1809–1852) in 1837, in which the letters are represented by patterns of raised dots, which are read by feeling with the finger tips. It is the main method of reading used by the blind.

brain n. the enlarged and highly developed mass of nervous tissue that forms the upper end of the *central nervous system (see illustration). The average adult human brain weighs about 1400 g (approximately 2% of total body weight) and is continuous below with the spinal cord. It is invested by three connective tissue membranes, the *meninges, and floats in *cerebrospinal fluid within the rigid casing formed by the bones of the skull. The brain is divided into the hindbrain (rhombencephalon), consisting of the *medulla oblongata, *pons, and *cerebellum; the *midbrain (mesencephalon); and the forebrain (prosencephalon), subdivided into the *cerebrum and the *diencephalon (including the *thalamus and *hypothalamus). The brain is usually considered to be the site of the working of the mind, but to what extent the concepts of ‘brain’ and ‘mind’ are interchangeable is a matter of debate and of concern to anyone facing brain surgery. Anatomical name: encephalon.

The brain (midsagittal section).





brain death see death.

brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) see natriuretic peptide.

brainstem n. the enlarged extension upwards within the skull of the spinal cord, consisting of the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain. The pons and medulla are together known as the bulb, or bulbar area. Attached to the midbrain are the two cerebral hemispheres. See brain.

brainstem evoked response audiometry see auditory brainstem response audiometry.

brain tumour see cerebral tumour.

branchial arch see pharyngeal arch.

branchial cleft see pharyngeal cleft.

branchial cyst a cyst that arises at the site of an embryonic *pharyngeal pouch and is due to a developmental anomaly.

branchial pouch see pharyngeal pouch.

Brandt–Andrews method a technique for expelling the placenta from the uterus. Upward pressure is applied to the uterus through the abdominal wall while holding the umbilical cord taut. When the uterus is elevated in this way, the placenta will be in the cervix or upper vagina and is then expelled by applying pressure below the base of the uterus. [T. Brandt (1819–95), Swedish obstetrician; H. R. Andrews (1872–1942), British gynaecologist]

Brandt–Daroff exercises a sequence of exercises used in the treatment of *benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Patients are taught how to perform the exercises and then continue the programme at home.

Braxton Hicks contractions irregular painless contractions of the uterus that occur during pregnancy and may become stronger towards term. [J. Braxton Hicks (1825–97), British obstetrician]

BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Women with mutations in either of these genes have a 56–85% risk of developing breast cancer, and this form of the cancer tends to develop at a relatively young age. The risk of ovarian cancer is 36–66% in women with BRCA1 mutations and 10–20% with BRCA2. Targeted therapy specific to these mutations using a *PARP inhibitor is undergoing investigation.

breakbone fever see dengue.

breast n. 1. the mammary gland of a woman: one of two compound glands that produce milk. Each breast consists of glandular lobules – the milk-secreting areas – embedded in fatty tissue (see illustration). The milk passes from the lobules into ducts, which join up to form 15–20 lactiferous ducts. Near the front of the breast the lactiferous ducts are dilated into ampullae, which act as reservoirs for the milk. Each lactiferous duct discharges through a separate orifice in the nipple. The dark area around the nipple is called the areola. See also lactation. Anatomical name: mamma. 2. the front part of the chest (thorax).

Breast (longitudinal section).





breastbone n. see sternum.

breast cancer a malignant tumour of the breast, usually a *carcinoma, rarely a *sarcoma. It is unusual in men but is the most common form of cancer in women, in some cases involving both breasts. Cumulative exposure to higher oestrogen levels is implicated as a causal factor: breast cancer is most strongly associated with early menarche and late menopause, childlessness, and late age at the birth of the first child, and hence with an increase in the total number of menstrual cycles in a woman’s life. Approximately 5% of cases are due to the *BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.

The classic sign is a lump in the breast, usually painless; bleeding or discharge from the nipple may occur infrequently. Sometimes the first thing to be noticed is a lump in the axilla (armpit), which is caused by spread of the cancer to the drainage lymph nodes. The tumour may also spread to the bones, lungs, and liver. Current treatment of a localized tumour is usually by surgery (see lumpectomy; mastectomy), with or without radiotherapy; cytotoxic drugs and hormone therapy are used as *adjuvant therapy and *neoadjuvant chemotherapy and for widespread (metastatic) disease. Anti-oestrogenic agents used include *tamoxifen and (more recently) *aromatase inhibitors and *trastuzumab (Herceptin).

breast implant a prosthesis to replace breast tissue that has been removed surgically during a simple *mastectomy in the treatment of breast cancer. The type of implant in current use is a silicone sac filled with silicone gel; it has recently been found that coating the sac with polyurethane to give a textured surface reduces the incidence of fibrosis around the implant and consequent hardening of breast tissue. Alternatively, an implant with a soya-oil filling may be used. The implant is inserted subcutaneously at the time of operation (the skin and nipple are retained), and follow-up radiotherapy is not normally required. Implants are also used to augment existing breast tissue.

breast-milk jaundice prolonged jaundice lasting several weeks after birth in breast-fed babies for which no other cause can be found. It improves with time and is not an indication to stop breast-feeding.

breath-holding attacks episodes in which a child (usually aged between one and five) cries, holds its breath, and goes blue. Such attacks are usually precipitated by temper and may cause loss of consciousness. Drug treatment is not necessary and the attacks cease spontaneously.

breathing n. the alternation of active inhalation (or inspiration) of air into the lungs through the mouth or nose with the passive exhalation (or expiration) of the air. During inhalation the *diaphragm and *intercostal muscles contract, which enlarges the chest cavity and draws air into the lungs. Relaxation of these muscles forces air out of the lungs at exhalation. (See illustration.) Breathing is part of *respiration and is sometimes called external respiration. There are many types of breathing in which the rhythm, rate, or character is abnormal. See also apnoea; bronchospasm; Cheyne–Stokes respiration; dyspnoea; stridor.

Breathing. Position of the diaphragm (from the side) during breathing.





breathlessness n. see dyspnoea.

breath sounds the sounds heard through a stethoscope placed over the lungs during breathing. Normal breath sounds are soft and called vesicular – they may be increased or decreased in disease states. The sounds heard over the larger bronchi are louder and harsher. Breath sounds transmitted through consolidated lungs in pneumonia are louder and harsher; they are similar to the sounds heard normally over the larger bronchi and are termed bronchial breath sounds. *Crepitations and *rhonchi are sounds added to the breath sounds in abnormal states of the lung. Amphoric or cavernous sounds have a hollow quality and are heard over cavities in the lung; the amphoric quality may also be heard in voice sounds and on percussion.

breech presentation the position of a baby in the uterus such that it will be delivered buttocks first (instead of the normal head-first delivery). This type of delivery increases the risk of damage to the baby. See also Burns-Marshall manoeuvre; cephalic version; Løvset’s manoeuvre; Mauriceau–Smellie–Viet manoeuvre.

bregma n. the point on the top of the skull at which the coronal and sagittal *sutures meet. In a young infant this is an opening, the anterior *fontanelle.

brentuximab vedotin a monoclonal antibody–drug conjugate used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s disease and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

Breslow thickness the distance (in millimetres) between the surface and the deepest extent of a malignant *melanoma. The measurement is the best prognostic indicator in melanoma; tumours that are less than 0.76 mm thick have a 5-year survival in well over 90% of patients. [A. Breslow (1928–80), US pathologist]

bridge n. (in dentistry) a fixed replacement for missing teeth. The artificial tooth is attached to one or more natural teeth, usually by a crown. Bridges may also be fitted on dental *implants. The supporting teeth (or implants) are referred to as abutments, and the artificial teeth that fit over them are referred to as retainers. The replacements of missing teeth are known as pontics. Adhesive bridges are attached to one or more adjacent teeth by a metal plate that adheres to the enamel on the tooth surface prepared by the *acid-etch technique; these bridges require minimal tooth preparation compared with conventional types of bridges.

brief resolved unexplained episode (BRUE) a sudden, brief (less than 30 to 60 seconds), and resolved episode in an infant that includes one or more of the following: decreased or irregular breathing; change in muscle tone; pallor or cyanosis or altered responsiveness. The episode is frightening for the person caring for the infant. BRUE is a description rather than a diagnosis and the term is used only when there is no explanation for the event after a thorough history and examination.

Bright’s disease see nephritis. [R. Bright (1789–1858), British physician]

brimonidine n. an alpha agonist (see sympathomimetic) used in the form of eye drops in the treatment of *glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The drug reduces the production of aqueous humour and increases its outflow from the eye; it may be used when beta-blocker eye drops are medically undesirable or are ineffective in controlling the glaucoma.

brinzolamide n. a *carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to reduce intraocular pressure in the treatment of *glaucoma when beta blockers are not effective or appropriate: it decreases the production of aqueous humour. It may cause local irritation and taste disturbance.

British Medical Association (BMA) a professional body for doctors and also an independent trade union dedicated to protecting individual members and the collective interests of doctors. It has a complex structure that allows representation both by geographical area of work and through various committees, including the General Practice Committee (GPC), Central Consultants and Specialists Committee, Junior Doctors Committee, and the Medical Students Committee.

British National Formulary (BNF) a reference source published by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Group twice a year (in March and September). It contains comprehensive information on medications from various sources, including the manufacturer as well as regulatory and professional bodies, resulting in information that is relevant to practice and takes into account national guidelines.

British Sign Language (BSL) see sign language.

British thermal unit a unit of heat equal to the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1° Fahrenheit. 1 British thermal unit = 1055 joules. Abbrev.: Btu.

brittle bone disease see osteogenesis imperfecta.

brittle diabetes type 1 *diabetes mellitus that constantly causes disruption of lifestyle due to recurrent attacks of hypo- or hyperglycaemia from whatever cause. The most common reasons are therapeutic errors, emotional disorders, intercurrent illnesses, and self- or carer-induced episodes.

BRM see biological response modifier.

Broca’s area the area of cerebral motor cortex responsible for the initiation and control of speech. It is situated in the left frontal lobe in most (but not all) right-handed people, in the region of *Brodmann areas 44 and 45. [P. P. Broca (1824–80), French surgeon]

Brodie’s abscess a chronic abscess of bone that develops from acute bacterial *osteomyelitis. The classic appearance on X-ray is a small walled-off cavity in the bone with little or no periosteal reaction. Treatment is by surgical drainage and antibiotics. [Sir B. C. Brodie (1783–1862), British surgeon]

Brodmann areas the numbered areas (1–47) into which a map of the *cerebral cortex may conveniently be divided for descriptive purposes, based upon the arrangement of neurons seen in stained sections under the microscope. On the map area 4, for example, corresponds to primary motor cortex, while the primary visual cortex comes into area 17. [K. Brodmann (1868–1918), German neurologist]

bromism n. a group of symptoms caused by excessive intake of bromides, formerly widely used as sedatives. Overuse for long periods leads to mental dullness, weakness, drowsiness, loss of sensation, slurred speech, and sometimes coma. A form of acne may also develop.

bromocriptine n. a *dopamine receptor agonist, derived from ergot, that is used in the treatment of disorders associated with excessive secretion of *prolactin (such as *prolactinoma and galactorrhoea), since it inhibits the secretion of this hormone by the pituitary gland. It may also be used to treat *acromegaly, as it suppresses the release of growth hormone, and – rarely – parkinsonism. Side-effects may include nausea, constipation, drowsiness, and dizziness, and there is a risk of *fibrosis.

Brompton cocktail a mixture of alcohol, morphine, and cocaine sometimes given to control severe pain in terminally ill people, especially those dying of cancer. The mixture was first tried at the Brompton Hospital, London.

bromsulphthalein n. a blue dye used in tests of liver function. A small quantity of the dye is injected into the bloodstream, and its concentration in the blood is measured after 5 and then 45 minutes. The presence of more than 10% of the dose in the circulation after 45 minutes indicates that the liver is not functioning normally.

bronch- (broncho-) combining form denoting the bronchial tree. Examples: bronchoalveolar (relating to the bronchi and alveoli); bronchopulmonary (relating to the bronchi and lungs).

bronchial carcinoma cancer of the bronchus, one of the commonest causes of death in smokers. See also lung cancer; small-cell lung cancer.

bronchial tree a branching system of tubes conducting air from the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs: includes the bronchi (see bronchus) and their subdivisions and the *bronchioles.

bronchiectasis n. widening of the bronchi or their branches. It may be congenital or it may result from infection (especially whooping cough or measles in childhood) or from obstruction, either by an inhaled foreign body or by a growth (including cancer). Pus may form in the widened bronchus so that the patient coughs up purulent sputum, which may contain blood. Diagnosis is on the clinical symptoms and by X-ray and CT scan. Treatment consists of antibiotic drugs to control the infection and physiotherapy to drain the sputum. Surgery may be used if only a few segments of the bronchi are affected.

bronchiole n. a subdivision of the bronchial tree that does not contain cartilage or mucous glands in its wall. Bronchioles open from the fifth or sixth generation of bronchi and extend for up to 20 more generations before reaching the terminal bronchioles. Each terminal bronchiole divides into a number of respiratory bronchioles, from which the *alveoli open. Each terminal bronchiole conducts air to an acinus in the *lung. —bronchiolar adj.

bronchiolitis n. inflammation of the small airways in the lungs (the *bronchioles) due to viral infection, usually the *respiratory syncytial virus. Bronchiolitis occurs in epidemics and is commonest in infants of less than one year. The bronchioles become swollen, the lining cells die, and the tubes become blocked with debris and mucopus. This prevents air reaching the alveoli and the child becomes short of oxygen (hypoxic) and breathless. In mild cases no treatment is necessary; more severe cases require supportive treatment – administration of oxygen and feeding via a nasogastric tube. Antibiotics are indicated only if there is evidence of a secondary infection. If the child is particularly vulnerable, specific treatment with *ribavirin or artificial ventilation may be beneficial. Recurrent attacks of bronchiolitis may herald the onset of *asthma.

bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) a disease entity characterized clinically by a flulike illness with cough, fever, shortness of breath, and late inspiratory crackles; there are specific histological features and patchy infiltrates on X-ray. It is sometimes the result of a viral infection, but may follow medication with certain drugs or be associated with connective-tissue disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The condition usually responds to oral corticosteroids; however, if a drug is implicated, it must be withdrawn.

bronchitis n. inflammation of the bronchi (see bronchus). Acute bronchitis is caused by viruses or bacteria and is characterized by coughing, the production of mucopurulent sputum, and narrowing of the bronchi due to spasmodic contraction (see bronchospasm). In chronic bronchitis the patient coughs up excessive mucus secreted by enlarged bronchial mucous glands on most days for at least three consecutive months in at least two consecutive years; the bronchospasm cannot always be relieved by bronchodilator drugs. It is not primarily an inflammatory condition, although it is frequently complicated by acute infections. The disease is particularly prevalent in Britain in association with cigarette smoking, air pollution, and *emphysema. The combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema is often referred to as *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) a method of obtaining cellular material from the lungs that is used particularly in the investigation and monitoring of interstitial lung disease and in the investigation of pulmonary infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients. A saline solution is infused into the lung, via a bronchoscope, and immediately removed. Examination of the cells in the lavage fluid may help to identify the cause of interstitial lung disease. The combination of cytological and microbiological examination can lead to a very high rate of diagnostic accuracy in such conditions as *Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.

bronchoconstrictor n. a drug that causes narrowing of the air passages by producing spasm of bronchial smooth muscle.

bronchodilator n. an agent that causes widening of the air passages by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. *Sympathomimetic drugs that stimulate β2 adrenoceptors, such as *formoterol, *salbutamol, and *terbutaline, are potent bronchodilators and are used for relief of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These drugs are often administered as aerosols, giving rapid relief, but at high doses they may stimulate the heart. Some antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. *ipratropium and *theophylline) are also used as bronchodilators.

bronchography n. X-ray examination of the bronchial tree after it has been made visible by the injection of *radiopaque dye or contrast medium. It was used particularly in the diagnosis of *bronchiectasis, but has now been largely superseded by CT scanning.

bronchophony n. see vocal resonance.

bronchopneumonia n. see pneumonia.

bronchopulmonary dysplasia a condition, seen usually in premature babies as a result of *respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged treatment with oxygen beyond the age of 28 days. The babies have overexpanded lungs, which on X-rays show characteristic changes. Management consists of oxygen support and treating infections. Recovery is slow, sometimes over several years, but most babies do recover.

bronchoscope n. an instrument used to look into the trachea and bronchi. In addition to the rigid tubular metal type, used for many years, there is now a narrower flexible *fibreoptic instrument with which previously inaccessible bronchi can be inspected. With either instrument the bronchial tree can be washed out (see bronchoalveolar lavage) and samples of tissue and foreign bodies can be removed with long forceps. —bronchoscopy n.

bronchospasm n. narrowing of bronchi by muscular contraction in response to some stimulus, as in *asthma and *bronchitis. The patient can usually inhale air into the lungs, but exhalation may require visible muscular effort and is accompanied by expiratory noises that are clearly audible (see wheeze) or detectable with a stethoscope. The condition in which bronchospasm can usually be relieved by bronchodilator drugs is known as reversible obstructive airways disease and includes asthma; that in which bronchodilator drugs usually have no effect is irreversible obstructive airways disease and includes chronic bronchitis.

bronchus n. (pl. bronchi) any of the air passages beyond the *trachea (windpipe) that has cartilage and mucous glands in its wall (see illustration). The trachea divides into two main bronchi, which divide successively into five lobar bronchi, 20 segmental bronchi, and two or three more divisions. See also bronchiole. —bronchial adj.

Bronchus. The bronchi and their principal (lobar) branches.

brown fat a form of fat in adipose tissue that is a rich source of energy and can be converted rapidly to heat. It accounts for 5% of body weight in human infants; adults have little or no brown fat. The main form of adipose tissue in adults, white fat (accounting for 20–25% body weight), stores energy; infants have little or no white fat. Some forms of obesity may be linked to lack of – or inability to synthesize – brown fat.

Brown-Séquard syndrome the neurological condition resulting when the spinal cord has been damaged. In those parts of the body supplied by the damaged segment there is a flaccid weakness and loss of feeling in the skin. Below the lesion there is a spastic paralysis on the same side and a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side. The causes include trauma and multiple sclerosis. [C. E.

B. pahangi, a parasite of wild cats and domestic animals, produces an allergic condition in humans, with coughing, breathing difficulty, and an increase in the number of *eosinophils in the blood. Brugia undergoes part of its development in mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Mansonia, which transmit the parasite from host to host.

bruise (contusion) n. an area of skin discoloration caused by the escape of blood from ruptured underlying vessels following injury. Initially red or pink, a bruise gradually becomes bluish, and then greenish yellow, as the haemoglobin in the tissues breaks down chemically and is absorbed. It may be necessary to draw off blood from very severe bruises through a needle, to aid healing. A bruise may be the sign of previous assault, detected on clinical examination or at *autopsy. In a child it may be the only (and vital) evidence of *child abuse. See also burn.

bruit n. a sharp or harsh systolic sound, heard on *auscultation, that is due to turbulent blood flow in a peripheral artery, usually the carotid or iliofemoral artery. Bruits can also be heard over arteriovenous *fistulae or malformations.

Budd–Chiari syndrome a rare condition that follows occlusion of the hepatic veins by thrombosis or nonthrombotic processes. In the majority of cases the cause is unknown but hypercoagulable states, local or disseminated malignancy, and infection are possible causes. It is characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distension due to ascites, and jaundice. Clinical examination may reveal hepatomegaly, and *hepatic encephalopathy. [G. Budd (1808–82), British physician; H. Chiari (1851–1916), German pathologist]

Buerger’s disease an inflammatory condition of the arteries, especially in the legs, that predominantly affects young male cigarette smokers. Intermittent *claudication (pain due to reduced blood supply) and gangrene of the limbs may develop. Coronary thrombosis may occur and venous thrombosis is common. The treatment is similar to that of *atheroma but cessation of smoking is essential to prevent progression of the disease. Medical name: thromboangiitis obliterans. [L. Buerger (1879–1943), US physician]

buffalo hump excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue forming a hump on the back over the lower cervical (neck) and upper thoracic regions of the spine. It is seen classically in *Cushing’s syndrome but also in patients who are obese. Compare dowager’s hump.

BUN blood urea nitrogen: a measurement of nitrogen in the form of urea in the blood, usually reported as mg/dl, in common usage in the USA (each molecule of urea has two nitrogen atoms, each of molar mass 14 g/mol). Elsewhere, the concentration of urea in the serum is reported as mmol/L:



BUN or serum urea is used as a measure of kidney function but is less precise than the serum creatinine or estimates of glomerular filtration rate based on the serum creatinine (see eGFR). A disproportionate rise in blood urea nitrogen (or serum urea) compared with creatinine may be seen with volume depletion, cardiac failure, high protein diets, gastrointestinal bleeding, loss of muscle (the classic example is the bilateral amputee), and catabolic states associated with severe burns and fevers.

bundle n. a group of muscle or nerve fibres situated close together and running in the same direction; e.g. the *atrioventricular bundle.

bundle branch block a defect in the specialized conducting tissue of the heart (see arrhythmia) that is identified on an *electrocardiogram. Right bundle branch block is a normal variant in children and young adults, but may reflect chronic lung disease or ischaemic heart disease in older adults. Left bundle branch block may occur with ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy.

bundle of His see atrioventricular bundle. [W. His (1863–1934), Swiss anatomist]

bunion n. an area of thickened tissue overlying the metatarsal phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe. It arises when a protective *bursa develops around the joint in response to friction and pressure from ill-fitting footwear. The condition is most commonly associated with *hallux valgus. Treatment may range from modified footwear to surgery.

buphthalmos (hydrophthalmos) n. infantile or congenital glaucoma: increased pressure within the eye due to a defect in the development of the tissues through which fluid drains from the eye (the *trabecular meshwork). Since the outer coat (sclera) of the eyeball of children is distensible, the eye enlarges as the inflow of fluid continues. It usually affects both eyes and may accompany congenital abnormalities in other parts of the body. Treatment is by surgical operation, e.g. *goniotomy, to improve drainage of fluid from the eye. Spontaneous arrest of buphthalmos may occur before vision is completely lost.

bupivacaine n. a potent local anaesthetic used for regional *nerve block, including *epidural anaesthesia during labour and to relieve postoperative pain. It is significantly longer acting than many other local anaesthetics.

Burs are mainly used for cutting cavities in teeth, removing old restorations, and preparing teeth to receive artificial crowns. 2. (burr) a surgical drill for cutting through bone or other tissue.

burden of treatment the extra work or worry imposed on a patient by a treatment regime. This might include e.g. arranging and attending hospital appointments, collecting and managing medication, learning about a condition, and making lifestyle changes. For those with chronic conditions, these tasks can impose a significant toll on energy and wellbeing as well as disrupting their family and working life.

bur hole (burr hole) a circular hole drilled through the skull to release intracranial pressure (due to blood, pus, or cerebrospinal fluid) or to facilitate such procedures as needle aspiration or biopsy.

buried bumper syndrome a condition in which feeding via a PEG tube (see gastrostomy) is blocked. It occurs when the internal retention disc (bumper) of the tube, which holds it in place inside the stomach, is overgrown by hypertrophic gastric mucosa and becomes embedded in the stomach wall. This serious complication requires surgical removal of the tube. It can be prevented by correct tube care: advancing, retracting, and rotating of the tube.

Burkitt’s lymphoma a malignant tumour of the lymphatic system, most commonly affecting children and largely confined to tropical Africa in a zone 15° north and south of the equator. It is the most rapidly growing malignancy, with a tumour doubling time of about five days. It can arise at various sites, most commonly the facial structures, such as the jaw, and in the abdomen. The *Epstein-Barr virus plays a role in the origin and growth of the tumour. Complications affecting the nervous system occur in up to 50% of cases. Non-African Burkitt’s lymphoma is increasingly being recognized. All forms are very sensitive to cytotoxic drug therapy but cure is uncommon. [D. P. Burkitt (1911–93), Irish surgeon]

burn n. tissue damage caused by such agents as heat, cold, chemicals, electricity, ultraviolet light, or nuclear radiation. A first-degree burn affects only the outer layer (epidermis) of the skin. In a second-degree burn both the epidermis and the underlying dermis are damaged. A third-degree burn involves damage or destruction of the skin to its full depth and damage to the tissues beneath. Burns cause swelling and blistering, due to loss of plasma from damaged blood vessels. In serious burns, affecting 15% or more of the body surface in adults (10% or more in children), this loss of plasma results in severe *shock and requires immediate transfusion of blood or saline solution. Burns may also lead to bacterial infection, which can be prevented by administration of antibiotics. Third-degree burns may require skin grafting. Small burns, or scars of previous burns, may be vital evidence of *child abuse.

burning mouth syndrome (BMS) a disorder characterized by a burning sensation in the mouth for which there is no obvious medical or dental cause. Other symptoms may include thirst, sore throat, and an unpleasant taste. BMS occurs most commonly in older females and may be related to menopause, stress, or vitamin deficiencies.

burnout n. a state of deep mental and physical exhaustion in a professional, caused by excessive and ceaseless work demands. Managers have a duty to try to prevent burnout in their staff by providing proper working conditions and making support available. Individuals likewise have a duty to seek help when they need it. A burnt-out member of staff may not be reliable in the usual way and may leave the service prematurely.

Burns–Marshall manoeuvre a manoeuvre used during an assisted *breech presentation. The baby’s legs and trunk should be allowed to hang until the nape of the neck is visible at the mother’s perineum so that its weight exerts gentle downwards and backwards traction to promote flexion of the head. The fetal trunk is then swept in a wide arc over the maternal abdomen by grasping both the feet and maintaining gentle traction; the aftercoming head is slowly born in this process.

burr n. see bur.

burr cell (echinocyte) a red blood cell (erythrocyte) with abnormal small thorny projections. See crenation.

bursa n. (pl. bursae) a small sac of fibrous tissue that is lined with *synovial membrane and filled with fluid (synovia). Bursae occur where parts move over one another; they help to reduce friction. They are normally formed round joints and in places where ligaments and tendons pass over bones. However, they may be formed in other places in response to unusual pressure or friction.

bursitis n. inflammation of a *bursa, resulting from repetitive slight injury, pressure, or friction or from infection or inflammatory conditions. Commonly affecting the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, or heel, it produces pain and tenderness and sometimes restricts joint movement. Treatment of bursitis not due to infection includes rest, *NSAIDs, and possibly local anaesthetic and corticosteroid injections. See also housemaid’s knee.

burst abdomen (abdominal dehiscence) spontaneous opening of a surgical wound after an abdominal operation.

Buruli ulcer a chronic, debilitating illness caused by Mycrobacterium ulcerans. It begins with a painless swelling, most often on the arm or leg, that develops into a necrotizing ulcer. The condition occurs most commonly in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia, with some 2 000 cases being reported annually. At present there is no vaccine; antibiotics are usually effective if prescribed at an early stage.

A bypass can be temporary or permanent and is commonly performed in the treatment of cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders. See also cardiopulmonary bypass; coronary artery bypass graft.

byssinosis n. an industrial disease of the lungs caused by inhalation of dusts of cotton, flax, hemp, or sisal. The patient characteristically has chest tightness and *wheeze after the weekend break, which wears off during the working week.





c


CA125 n. a *tumour marker that can be detected by a simple blood test and is particularly useful in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and also for subsequently monitoring its response to treatment. In a patient being evaluated for a pelvic mass, a CA125 level greater than 65 is associated with malignancy in approximately 90% of cases (see risk of malignancy index). A number of benign conditions, including endometriosis and heart failure, can also cause elevations of the CA125 level, as can cancers other than ovarian cancer, including malignancies of the endometrium, lung, breast, and gastrointestinal tract.

CA19-9 n. a substance whose presence in the bloodstream can be increased in certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancers, and is increasingly used as a *tumour marker in blood tests.

cachet n. a flat capsule containing a drug that has an unpleasant taste. The cachet is swallowed intact by the patient.

cachexia n. a condition of abnormally low weight, weakness, and general bodily decline associated with chronic disease. It occurs in such conditions as cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and malaria.

cacosmia n. a disorder of the sense of smell in which scents that are inoffensive to most people are objectionable to the sufferer or in which a bad smell seems to be perpetually present. The disorder is usually due to damage to pathways within the brain rather than in the nose or olfactory nerve.

CAD see coronary artery disease.

cadmium n. a silvery metallic element that can cause serious lung irritation if the fumes of the molten metal are inhaled. Long-term exposure may also cause kidney damage. Symbol: Cd.

caecostomy n. the creation of an artificial *stoma that serves as a bridge between the caecum and the anterior abdominal wall. Its function is to facilitate lavage in patients with refractory constipation or to decompress the intestine, usually when the colon is obstructed or injured. This may be performed surgically or endoscopically (percutaneous endoscopic caecostomy, PEC).

caecum n. a blind-ended pouch at the junction of the small and large intestines, situated below the *ileocaecal valve. The upper end is continuous with the colon and the lower end bears the vermiform appendix. See alimentary canal.

caeruloplasmin n. a copper-containing protein present in blood plasma. Congenital deficiency of caeruloplasmin leads to abnormalities of the brain and liver (see Wilson’s disease).

Caesarean section a surgical operation for delivering a baby through the abdominal wall. The operation most commonly performed is lower uterine segment Caesarean section (LUSCS), carried out through a transverse incision in the lower portion of the uterus (see lower uterine segment). Classical Caesarean section, in which the upper segment of the uterus is incised vertically, is now rarely performed. In addition to its use in cases of obstructed labour, *malpresentation (breech, brow, and shoulder), and in severe *antepartum haemorrhage, Caesarean section is being performed increasingly when the baby is at risk and is exhibiting signs of distress. Because of improved techniques in perinatal care, particularly of the preterm baby, the operation may be performed, if necessary, as soon as the child is viable.

caesium-137 n. an artificial radioactive isotope of the metallic element caesium. The radiation given off by caesium-137 can be employed in the technique of *radiotherapy, but is now rarely used. Symbol: Cs-137.

caffeine n. an alkaloid drug, present in coffee and tea, that has a stimulant action, particularly on the central nervous system. It is used to promote wakefulness and increase mental activity; it also possesses diuretic properties, and large doses may cause headache. Caffeine is often included with aspirin or codeine in analgesic preparations.

Caffey’s disease see hyperostosis. [J. Caffey (1895–1966), US paediatrician]

CAGE questionnaire a screening tool for alcoholism, widely used in hospitals, primary care, and psychiatric services. The name derives from an acronym of its four questions: (1) Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on your drinking? (2) Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? (3) Have you ever felt guilty about drinking? (4) Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover? A CAGE test score of two or more yes answers indicates a reasonably high likelihood of alcohol problems.

The group includes *ciclosporin and *tacrolimus, which are major maintenance immunosuppressants used in transplantation. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus, pimecrolimus [Elidel]) are used in the treatment of eczema when topical steroids have failed or are contraindicated. Stinging is a common transient side-effect, and reactivation of infections may occur.

calcinosis n. the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in the tissues. This may occur only in the fat layer beneath the skin or it may be more widespread. See also metastatic calcification.

calciphylaxis n. calcific uraemic arteriolopathy: a rare and often fatal complication of end-stage renal failure associated with small vessel calcification, intractable skin ulceration, and a high risk of septic complications.

calcipotriol n. a vitamin D analogue administered as an ointment or scalp lotion for the treatment of psoriasis. Possible side-effects include skin irritation and facial dermatitis.

calcitonin (thyrocalcitonin) n. a hormone, produced by *C cells in the thyroid gland, that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. Medullary *thyroid cancer can produce high levels of this hormone, enabling its use as a tumour marker. A recombinant form of salmon calcitonin, salcatonin, is given by injection or nasal spray to treat malignant hypercalcaemia and Paget’s disease of the bone. Compare parathyroid hormone.

calcitriol n. 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol: the final and most metabolically active form of vitamin D3. It is formed in the kidney by the addition of two hydroxy (−OH) groups to the basic vitamin D molecule, which itself is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol or ingested in certain foods. Calcitriol is given to raise blood calcium levels in patients with severe kidney disease and to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is also used as an ointment to treat psoriasis.

calcium n. a metallic element essential for the normal development and functioning of the body. Calcium is an important constituent of bones and teeth: the matrix of *bone, consisting principally of calcium phosphate, accounts for about 99% of the body’s calcium. It is present in the blood at a concentration of about 10 mg/100 ml, being maintained at this level by hormones (see calcitonin; parathyroid hormone). It is essential for many metabolic processes, including nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.

The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) for men is 700 mg/day and women 800 mg/day; the National Osteoporosis Society recommends up to 1200 mg/day for individuals with *osteoporosis. The best sources are dairy products (milk and cheese); the absorption from cereals and green vegetables is limited by the presence of phytates and oxalates. Its uptake by the body is facilitated by *vitamin D; a deficiency of this vitamin may result in such conditions as *rickets, osteoporosis, and *osteomalacia. A deficiency of calcium in the blood may lead to *tetany. Excess calcium may be deposited in the body as *calculi (stones). Symbol: Ca.

calcium-channel blocker (calcium antagonist) a drug that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and smooth-muscle cells; it therefore reduces the strength of heart-muscle contraction, reduces conduction of impulses in the heart, and causes *vasodilatation. Calcium-channel blockers, which include *amlodipine, *diltiazem, *nicardipine, *nifedipine, and *verapamil, are used to treat angina and high blood pressure.

calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease a condition in which calcium pyrophosphate is deposited in joints. The most common manifestation is *pseudogout, marked by acute pain, redness, and swelling resembling gout. Alternatively it may be asymptomatic in association with *chondrocalcinosis seen on X-ray, it may occur with osteoarthritis in the affected joint, or there may be chronic inflammation of the joint.

calcium score a quantification of the amount of calcium seen in the coronary arteries on a CT scan, calcium being a marker of severe coronary artery disease.

calculosis n. the presence of multiple calculi (stones) in the body. See calculus.

calculus n. (pl. calculi) 1. a stone: a hard pebble-like mass formed within the body, particularly in the gall bladder (see gallstone) or anywhere in the urinary tract (see cystolithiasis; nephrolithiasis; staghorn calculus). Calculi in the urinary tract are commonly composed of calcium oxalate and are usually visible on X-ray examination. Some of these stones cause pain if they are associated with obstruction and prevent urine flow in the ureter or kidney, or by direct irritation of the bladder. Stones passing down a duct (such as the ureter) cause severe colicky pain. Most stones pass spontaneously, but some need to be broken into smaller pieces, usually by extracorporeal *lithotripsy, and the remainder by endosurgical techniques (see litholapaxy) or rarely by open surgery. Calculi may also occur in the ducts of the salivary glands. 2. a calcified deposit that forms on the surface of a tooth that is covered with dental *plaque as a result of poor oral hygiene. Supragingival calculus forms above the *gingivae (gums), principally in relation to the openings of the salivary gland ducts. Subgingival calculus forms beneath the crest of the gingivae. Calculus hinders the cleaning of teeth and its presence contributes to *gingivitis and *periodontal disease. A link has been demonstrated between increased calculus levels and infective *endocarditis.

Caldicott guardian an individual appointed by an NHS trust or health authority board with overall responsibility for ensuring that the confidentiality and security of patient information is maintained.

calibrator n. 1. an instrument used for measuring the size of a tube or opening. 2. an instrument used for dilating a tubular part, such as the gullet.

calliper (caliper) n. 1. an instrument with two prongs or jaws, used for measuring diameters: used particularly in obstetrics for measuring the diameter of the pelvis. 2. (calliper splint) a surgical appliance (see orthosis) that is used to correct or control deformity of a joint in the leg. It consists of a metal bar that is fixed to the shoe and held to the leg by means of straps.

callosity (callus) n. a hard thick area of skin occurring in parts of the body subject to pressure or friction. The soles of the feet and palms of the hands are common sites, and if much hard dead skin develops, a callosity can become painful. A *corn is a type of callosity.

callotasis n. the process of stretching the callus that forms between the ends of a bone that has been divided. It is achieved by means of an external fixator attached to the bone in the procedure for *limb lengthening. The elongated callus consolidates to form new bone.

callus n. 1. the composite mass of tissue that forms between bone ends when a fracture is healing. It initially consists of blood clot and *granulation tissue, which develops into cartilage and then calcifies to form bone. Callus formation is an essential part of the process of healthy union in a fractured bone. 2. see callosity.

calor n. heat: one of the classical signs of inflammation in a tissue, the other three being *rubor (redness), *dolor (pain), and *tumor (swelling). An inflamed region has a higher temperature than normal because of the distended blood vessels, which allow an increased flow of blood.

calorie n. a unit commonly defined as the approximate amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C at atmospheric pressure. The energy value of foods should be expressed in kilocalories (one kilocalorie (kcal) is equal to 1000 calories). The SI unit is the *joule: 1 calorie = 4.1855 joules. The average adult requires 1994 kcal (women) or 2250 kcal (men) per day.

calorimeter n. any apparatus used to measure the heat lost or gained during various chemical and physical changes. For example, calorimeters may be used to determine the total energy values of different foods in terms of calories. —calorimetry n.

calprotectin n. a marker of intestinal inflammation. Faecal calprotectin is a noninvasive screening test that measures the quantity of calprotectin in a stool sample. If the result is strongly positive the patient should be assessed by a gastroenterologist and considered for invasive investigation. Very high levels of faecal calprotectin are seen in inflammatory bowel disease. If the patient’s symptoms suggest a functional bowel disorder (such as irritable bowel syndrome) but there are no worrying (or ‘red flag’) symptoms and the faecal calprotectin is negative, the patient does not require a colonoscopy.

calvaria n. the vault of the *skull.

calyx n. (pl. calyces) a cup-shaped part, especially any of the divisions of the pelvis of the *kidney. Each calyx receives urine from the urine-collecting tubes in one sector of the kidney.

Cameron’s ulcer linear *erosion found on the lining of the stomach at or near the level of the diaphragm in patients with large hiatus *hernias. The cause is unclear but interruption in the blood supply (*ischaemia) is one of the likely explanations. Treatment involves *antisecretory drugs and treatment of anaemia, which is often present.

Campbell de Morgan spots see angioma. [C. G. de Morgan (1811–76), British physician]

camphor n. a crystalline aromatic substance obtained from the tree Cinnamomum camphora. It is used in creams, liniments, and sprays as a counterirritant and antipruritic.

camptodactyly n. congenital and permanent flexion of a finger, most commonly the little finger; it can occur at one or both interphalangeal joints. It often affects both hands and is first noticed at the age of about ten; no treatment is needed.

Campylobacter n. a genus of motile Gram-negative bacteria that have a characteristic spiral or corkscrew appearance when viewed under an electron microscope. Species of Campylobacter are a common cause of food poisoning, producing headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting lasting for 3–5 days. See also Helicobacter.

canaglifozin n. see SGLT-2 inhibitors.

canal n. a tubular channel or passage; e.g. the *alimentary canal and the auditory canal of the ear.

canaliculitis n. inflammation of a canaliculus, especially a lacrimal canaliculus (see lacrimal apparatus).

canaliculus n. (pl. canaliculi) a small channel or canal. Canaliculi occur, for example, in compact bone, linking lacunae containing bone cells. Bile canaliculi are minute channels within the liver that transport bile to the bile duct. Lacrimal canaliculi drain tears into the lacrimal sac (see lacrimal apparatus).

canalith n. a particle derived from *otoliths in the *utricle of the inner ear, displaced from its normal site and located within the canal portion of one of the semicircular canals. Canaliths are implicated in *benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

cancellous adj. lattice-like: applied to the porous spongy network of flattened sheets of *bone, interconnected like a honeycomb, that forms the interior of bones and has a lower density than the surrounding cortical bone. See also lamellar bone.

cancer n. any *malignant tumour, including *carcinoma, *lymphoma, *leukaemia, and *sarcoma. It arises from the abnormal, purposeless, and uncontrolled division of cells that then invade and destroy the surrounding tissues. Spread of cancer cells (*metastasis) may occur via the bloodstream or the lymphatic channels or across body cavities such as the pleural and peritoneal spaces (see transcoelomic spread), thus setting up secondary tumours (metastases) at sites distant from the original tumour. Each individual primary tumour has its own pattern of local behaviour and spread; for example, bone metastasis is very common in cancers of the breast, bronchus, thyroid, kidney, and prostate but less common in other tumours.

There are many causative factors, some of which are known; for example, cigarette smoking is associated with lung cancer, radiation with some sarcomas and leukaemia, and several viruses are implicated (see oncogenic). A genetic element is implicated in the development of many cancers. In many cancers a gene called *p53 is deleted or impaired: its normal function is to prevent the uncontrolled division of cells (see tumour necrosis factor). Whatever the initiating cause, cancer always results ultimately from DNA mutations.

Treatment of cancer depends on the type of tumour, the site of the primary tumour, and the extent of spread. *Truth-telling will be important for most cancer patients but is still hard for some clinicians.

Candida n. a genus of *yeasts (formerly called Monilia) that inhabit the vagina and alimentary tract and can – under certain conditions – cause *candidiasis. The species C. albicans, a small oval budding fungus, is primarily responsible for candidiasis.

candidiasis (candidosis) n. a common *yeast infection of moist areas of the body, usually caused by *Candida albicans. It is especially common in the vagina, where it is known as thrush, but is also found in the mouth and skin folds. On the skin, the lesions are bright red with small satellite pustules, while in the mouth candidiasis appears as white patches on the tongue or inside the cheeks. In the vagina it produces itching and sometimes a thick white discharge. Candidiasis may develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as in those who are *immunocompromised. Topical, intravaginal, or oral therapy with *imidazoles is effective; oral *nystatin helps to reduce candidal infection of the bowel.

candour n. see truth-telling.

canine n. the pointed tooth that is the third from the midline of each jaw, between the incisors and premolars. There are thus four canines, two in each jaw, in both the permanent and primary (deciduous) *dentitions. It is known colloquially as the eye tooth.

cannabis n. a recreational drug prepared from the Indian hemp plant (Cannabis sativa), also known as pot, marijuana, hashish, and bhang. Smoked or swallowed, it produces euphoria and affects perception and awareness, particularly of time; high doses may cause hallucinations. In the UK cannabis is currently classified as a class B drug under the *Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (as amended). The medical use of cannabis products for those with ‘exceptional clinical need’ was legalized in 2018; this has so far been taken to include people with epilepsy and those suffering particularly severe effects from chemotherapy. A particular extract of cannabis containing its principal psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, had already (2010) been licensed for treating spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. See Appendix 12 for a list of street names for illicit drugs.

cannula n. a hollow tube designed for insertion into a body cavity, such as the bladder, or a blood vessel. The tube contains a sharp pointed solid core (trocar), which facilitates its insertion and is withdrawn when the cannula is in place. This allows aspiration of contents or infiltration of substances, such as medication.

cantholysis n. surgical division of the attachment of the *canthus (corner of the eye) from its underlying bone and tendon. It is performed as part of some eye operations.

canthoplasty n. a surgical procedure to reconstruct the *canthus (corner of the eye).

cap n. 1. a covering or a cover-like part. The duodenal cap is the superior part of the duodenum as seen on X-ray after a barium swallow and meal. 2. (in contraception) see diaphragm.

CAP community-acquired *pneumonia.

capacity n. the state of being able to make decisions about one’s medical care, i.e. to consent to or to refuse treatment. The law, by virtue of the *Mental Capacity Act 2005, requires that to assess capacity doctors should evaluate whether a patient can comprehend, retain, and weigh up information in the balance such as to make a considered decision that can be communicated. The patient must understand the nature, purpose, and possible consequences of having and not having investigations or treatments. Capacity is often impaired in such conditions as stroke, dementia, learning disability, mental illness, and intoxication with illicit substances. The term competence is often used as a synonym, but since the Mental Capacity Act 2005 came into force capacity is the preferred term. See also incompetence. —capacitous adj.

CAPD 1. chronic (or continuous) ambulatory *peritoneal dialysis: a method of treating renal failure on an out-patient basis. 2. central *auditory processing disorder.

capecitabine n. a drug of the *fluoropyrimidine class that is used in treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and breast cancer. Side-effects may include blood disorders (see myelosuppression) and mouth ulcers.

Capgras’ syndrome (illusion of doubles) the delusion that a person closely involved with the patient has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor. It is often, but not necessarily, a symptom of paranoid *schizophrenia. [J. M. J. Capgras (1873–1950), French psychiatrist]

capillary n. an extremely narrow blood vessel, approximately 5–20 μm in diameter. Capillaries form networks in most tissues; they are supplied with blood by arterioles and drained by venules. The vessel wall is only one cell thick, which enables exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, salts, etc., between the blood and the tissues (see illustrations).

Capillary. A network of capillaries (above); a single capillary (below).





capillary refill time a quickly performed test to assess the adequacy of circulation in an individual with poor cardiac output. An area of skin is pressed firmly by (say) a fingertip until it loses its colour; the number of seconds for the area to return to its original colour indicates capillary refill time. Normal capillary refill takes around 2 seconds. Slow capillary refill may occur globally in an individual with poor circulation or in a small area (e.g. a toe) in which local circulation is compromised (due, for example, to peripheral vascular disease). This test may not be very useful in people with dark skin.

capitate adj. head-shaped; having a rounded extremity.

capitate bone the largest bone of the wrist (see carpus). It articulates with the scaphoid and lunate bones behind, with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones in front, and with the trapezoid and hamate laterally.

capitellum n. see capitulum.

capitulum n. the small rounded end of a bone that articulates with another bone. For example, the capitulum humeri (or capitellum) is the round prominence at the elbow end of the humerus that articulates with the radius.

capping n. (in dentistry) 1. a colloquial term for crowning: the technique of fitting a tooth with an artificial *crown. 2. see pulp capping.

capreomycin n. an antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces capreolus, that is used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is given with other antituberculosis drugs to reduce the development of resistance by the infective bacteria. The more serious side-effects include ear and kidney damage.

capsule n. 1. a membrane, sheath, or other structure that encloses a tissue or organ. For example, the kidney, adrenal gland, and lens of the eye are enclosed within capsules. A joint capsule is the fibrous tissue, including the synovial membrane, that surrounds a freely movable joint. 2. a soluble case, usually made of gelatin, in which certain drugs are administered. 3. the slimy substance that forms a protective layer around certain bacteria, hindering their ingestion by phagocytes. It is usually made of *polysaccharide.

capsule endoscopy see video capsule endoscopy.

capsulitis n. inflammation of the capsule surrounding a joint. See also frozen shoulder.

capsulorrhexis n. a continuous tear made in the lens capsule of the eye. In anterior capsulorrhexis, performed during cataract surgery, the tear is made in the anterior surface of the capsule. It has the advantage over a *capsulotomy in making the residual capsule much more resilient to being torn during surgery.

capsulotomy n. an incision made in the capsule of the lens. In posterior capsulotomy a hole is made in the centre of the posterior capsule using a *YAG laser, thus providing a clear path for light rays to reach the retina. The laser light is aimed using a modified slit-lamp microscope from outside the eye.

captopril n. a drug used in the treatment of heart failure, hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy; it acts by inhibiting the action of angiotensin (see ACE inhibitor). Side-effects include rash, *neutropenia or *agranulocytosis, hypotension, and loss of taste.

caput succedaneum a temporary swelling of the soft parts of the head of a newly born infant that occurs during labour, due to compression by the muscles of the cervix (neck) of the uterus, and resolves after delivery. Compare cephalhaematoma; chignon.

carbamazepine n. an *anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epileptic tonic–clonic seizures, the prophylaxis of bipolar affective disorder, and to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. Common side-effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and muscular incoordination; abnormalities of liver and bone marrow may occur with long-term treatment.

carbamide peroxide a urea peroxide compound that is commonly used in tooth-whitening agents, anti-infective agents, and earwax remover.

carbidopa n. see levodopa.

carbimazole n. a *thionamide used to reduce the production of thyroid hormone in cases of overactivity of the gland (thyrotoxicosis). A prodrug, it is converted to its biologically active metabolite, methimazole, within the body. Gastrointestinal upsets, rashes, and itching may occur; more rarely, carbimazole may cause *myelosuppression.

carbocisteine n. see mucolytic.

carbohydrate n. any one of a large group of compounds, including the *sugars and *starch, that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and have the general formula Cx(H2O)y. Carbohydrates are important as a source of energy: they are manufactured by plants and obtained by animals from the diet, being one of the three main constituents of food (see also fat; protein). All carbohydrates are eventually broken down in the body to the simple sugar *glucose, which can then take part in energy-producing metabolic processes. Excess carbohydrate, not immediately required by the body, is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of *glycogen. In plants carbohydrates are important structural materials (e.g. cellulose) and storage products (commonly in the form of starch). See also disaccharide; monosaccharide; polysaccharide.

carbol fuchsin a red stain for bacteria and fungi, consisting of carbolic acid and *fuchsin dissolved in alcohol and water.

carbolic acid see phenol.

carbon dioxide a colourless gas formed in the tissues during metabolism and carried in the blood to the lungs, where it is exhaled (an increase in the concentration of this gas in the blood stimulates respiration). Carbon dioxide occurs in small amounts in the atmosphere; it is used by plants in the process of *photosynthesis. It forms a solid (dry ice) at –75°C (at atmospheric pressure) and in this form is used as a refrigerant. Formula: CO2.

carbonic anhydrase inhibitor any one of a class of drugs that act by blocking the action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme greatly speeds up the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid, a compound needed for the production of many of the body’s secretions. Carbonic anhydrase is present in high concentrations in the eye, kidneys, stomach lining, and pancreas. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce the production of aqueous humour in the eye and are used mainly in treating *glaucoma. They include *acetazolamide, *brinzolamide, and *dorzolamide.

carbon monoxide a colourless almost odourless gas that is very poisonous. When breathed in it combines with haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form *carboxyhaemoglobin, which is bright red in colour. This compound is chemically stable and thus the haemoglobin can no longer combine with oxygen. Carbon monoxide is present in coal gas and motor exhaust fumes. Formula: CO.

carbon tetrachloride a pungent volatile fluid used as a dry-cleaner. When inhaled or swallowed it may severely damage the heart, liver, and kidneys, causing cirrhosis and nephrosis, and it can also affect the optic nerve and other nerves. Treatment is by administration of oxygen. Formula: CCl4.

carboplatin n. a derivative of platinum that is used in the treatment of advanced ovarian and lung cancers. It is similar to *cisplatin but has fewer side-effects; in particular, it causes less nausea and nephrotoxicity but more myelosuppression.

carboprost n. a synthetic *prostaglandin used to control severe postpartum haemorrhage that has not responded to ergometrine and oxytocin. Side-effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and flushing.

carboxyhaemoglobin n. a substance formed when carbon monoxide combines with the pigment *haemoglobin in the blood. Carboxyhaemoglobin is incapable of transporting oxygen to the tissues and this is the cause of death in carbon monoxide poisoning. Large quantities of carboxyhaemoglobin are formed in carbon monoxide poisoning, and low levels are always present in the blood of smokers and city dwellers.

carboxylase n. an enzyme that catalyses the addition of carbon dioxide to a substance.

carbuncle n. a collection of *boils with multiple drainage channels. The infection is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and may result in an extensive slough of skin. Treatment is with antibiotics and sometimes also by surgery.

carcin- (carcino-) combining form denoting cancer or carcinoma. Example: carcinogenesis (development of).

carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) a protein produced in the fetus but not in normal adult life. It may be produced by carcinomas, particularly of the colon, and is a rather insensitive marker of malignancy. It is an example of an *oncofetal antigen that is used as a *tumour marker, particularly in the follow-up of colorectal cancer.

carcinogen n. any substance that, when exposed to living tissue, may cause the production of cancer. Known carcinogens include ionizing radiation and many chemicals, e.g. those found in cigarette smoke and those produced in certain industries. They cause damage to the DNA of cells that may persist if the cell divides before the damage is repaired. Damaged cells may subsequently develop into a *cancer (see also carcinogenesis). An inherent susceptibility to cancer may be necessary for a carcinogen to promote the development of cancer. See also oncogenic. —carcinogenic adj.

carcinogenesis n. the evolution of an invasive cancer cell from a normal cell. This is a multistep process characterized by successive genetic mutations caused by carcinogens. Intermediate stages, sometimes called premalignant, preinvasive, or noninvasive, may be recognizable, but the interchangeable use of these terms can be confusing, and they have been replaced by *carcinoma in situ.

carcinoid n. a tumour of the *argentaffin cells in the glands of the intestine (see apudoma). Carcinoids typically occur in the tip of the appendix and are among the commonest tumours of the small intestine. They may also occur in the rectum and other parts of the digestive tract and in the bronchial tree (bronchial carcinoid adenoma). Carcinoids sometimes produce 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), prostaglandins, and other physiologically active substances, which are inactivated in the liver. If a gastrointestinal tumour has spread to the liver, excess amounts of these substances are released into the systemic circulation and the carcinoid syndrome results – flushing, headache, diarrhoea, bronchial constriction causing asthma-like attacks, and in some cases damage to the right side of the heart associated with fibrosis of the tricuspid valve. Bronchial carcinoids can give rise to the syndrome without metastasizing.

carcinoma n. *cancer that arises in epithelium, the tissue that lines the skin and internal organs of the body. It may occur in any tissue containing epithelial cells. In many cases the site of origin of the tumour may be identified by the nature of the cells it contains. Organs may exhibit more than one type of carcinoma; for example, an adenocarcinoma and a squamous carcinoma may be found in the cervix (but not usually concurrently). Treatment depends on the nature of the primary tumour, different types responding to different drug combinations. —carcinomatous adj.

carcinoma in situ (CIS) the earliest stage of cancer spread, in which the neoplasm is confined by the basement membrane of the epithelium. Surgical removal of the growth should lead to cure. See also cervical cancer; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; ductal carcinoma in situ.

carcinomatosis n. carcinoma that has spread widely throughout the body. Spread of the cancer cells occurs via the lymphatic channels and bloodstream and across body cavities, for example the peritoneal cavity.

carcinosarcoma n. a malignant tumour of the cervix, uterus, or vagina containing a mixture of *adenocarcinoma and cells with a sarcoma appearance, previously called malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (MMMT). These tumours are actually epithelial in origin and should be treated as high-grade adenocarcinomas. Sarcomatoid differentiation of epithelial cancers often indicates a poor prognosis.

cardi- (cardio-) combining form denoting the heart. Examples: cardiomegaly (enlargement of); cardiopathy (disease of).

cardia n. 1. the opening at the upper end of the *stomach that connects with the oesophagus (gullet). 2. the heart.

cardiac adj. 1. of, relating to, or affecting the heart. 2. of or relating to the upper part of the stomach (see cardia).

cardiac arrest the cessation of effective pumping action of the heart. This may be because the heart stops beating altogether (*asystole), because there is normal electrical activity without mechanical pumping activity (*pulseless electrical activity), or because there is rapid, chaotic, ineffective electrical and mechanical activity of the heart (ventricular *fibrillation or *ventricular tachycardia). There is abrupt loss of consciousness, absence of the pulse, and breathing stops. Unless treated promptly, irreversible brain damage and death follow within minutes. Some patients may be resuscitated by airway clearance and support, artificial ventilation, massage of the heart, and (if ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia is present) *defibrillation.

cardiac arrest simulation a form of education in resuscitation skills using a *resuscitation mannikin wired up to a heart rhythm simulator that can mimic all common cardiac arrest situations. Candidates may be expected to perform basic life support as well as advanced life support and display skills in airway maintenance and team leadership. This form of teaching and assessment is widely used in advanced life support courses.

cardiac-arrest team a designated team of doctors in a hospital who attend *cardiac arrests as they occur and administer protocol-driven treatment according to the latest guidelines. See also medical emergency team.

cardiac cycle the sequence of events between one heartbeat and the next, normally occupying less than a second. The atria contract simultaneously and force blood into the relaxed ventricles. The ventricles then contract very strongly and pump blood out through the aorta and pulmonary artery. During ventricular contraction, the atria relax and fill up again with blood. See diastole; systole.

cardiac glycosides see glycoside; digoxin.

cardiac index the volume of blood pumped from the heart’s left ventricle divided by body surface area, expressed as litres per minute per square metre (l/min/m2). It is determined by heart rate and stroke volume index (the volume of blood pumped by the heart with each beat), and provides a normal range (2.5–4.0 l/min/m2) regardless of the size of the patient.

cardiac muscle the specialized muscle of which the walls of the *heart are composed. It is composed of a network of branching elongated cells (fibres) whose junctions with neighbouring cells are marked by irregular transverse bands known as intercalated discs.

cardiac output the amount of blood ejected by the heart in a minute, as measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. The range is 4.0–8.0 l/min.

cardiac reflex reflex control of the heart rate. Sensory fibres in the walls of the heart are stimulated when the heart rate increases above normal. Impulses are sent to the cardiac centre in the brain, stimulating the vagus nerve and leading to slowing of the heart rate.

cardiac rehabilitation a programme of staged exercises and lifestyle classes designed for people recovering from a heart attack and run through the local hospital by dedicated health care professionals, who may include specialist nurses, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists.

cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) a treatment for heart failure that involves ventricular pacing with multiple *leads. The aim is to restore coordinated ventricular contraction and hence improve cardiac function.

cardiac tamponade a dangerous situation in which there is a build-up of fluid around the heart within the pericardial sac. This causes compression of the heart, which is therefore unable to fill with blood adequately in order to pump effectively. Cardiac tamponade can result in heart failure, a drop in blood pressure, or cardiac arrest. It requires treatment by drainage of the fluid. The classical diagnostic features, known as Beck’s triad, consist of dilated neck veins, a fall in blood pressure, and muffled heart sounds.

cardinal veins two pairs of veins in the embryo that carry blood from the head (anterior cardinal veins) and trunk (posterior cardinal veins); they unite to form the common cardinal vein, which drains into the sinus venosus of the heart.

cardiogenic shock see heart failure; shock.

cardiology n. the science concerned with the study of the structure, function, and diseases of the heart. See also nuclear cardiology. —cardiologist n.

cardiomyopathy n. any chronic disorder affecting the muscle of the heart. It may be inherited but can be caused by various conditions, including virus infections, alcohol abuse, beriberi (vitamin B1 deficiency), and amyloidosis. The cause is often unknown. It may result in enlargement of the heart, *heart failure, *arrhythmias, and *thromboembolism. Modern drug treatment improves symptoms and prognosis. See also hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

cardiomyoplasty n. a surgical technique to replace or reinforce damaged cardiac muscle with skeletal muscle. It is now rarely performed.

cardiomyotomy n. see achalasia; myotomy.

cardioplegia n. a technique in which the heart is stopped by injecting it with a solution of salts, by hypothermia, or by an electrical stimulus. This has enabled complex cardiac surgery and transplants to be performed safely.

cardiopulmonary bypass a method by which the circulation to the body is maintained while the heart is deliberately stopped during heart surgery. The function of the heart and lungs is carried out by a pump-oxygenator (see heart-lung machine) until the natural circulation is restored.

cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) an emergency procedure for life support, consisting of artificial respiration and manual external cardiac massage. It is used in cases of cardiac arrest or apparent sudden death resulting from electric shock, drowning, respiratory arrest, or other causes, to establish effective circulation and ventilation in order to prevent irreversible brain damage. External cardiac massage compresses the heart, forcing blood into the systemic and pulmonary circulation; venous blood refills the heart when the compression is released. *Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or a mechanical form of ventilation oxygenates the blood being pumped through the circulatory system.

cardiotocograph n. the instrument used in *cardiotocography to produce a cardiotocogram, the graphic printout of the measurements obtained.

cardiotocography n. the electronic monitoring of the fetal heart rate and the frequency of uterine contractions. The former is detected by an external transducer or a fetal scalp electrode, and the latter by a second external transducer.

cardiotomy syndrome (postcardiotomy syndrome) a condition that may develop weeks or months after heart surgery and is characterized by fever and *pericarditis. Pneumonia and pleurisy may form part of the syndrome. It is thought to be an *autoimmune disease and may be recurrent. A similar syndrome (Dressler’s syndrome) may follow myocardial infarction. It may respond to anti-inflammatory drugs.

cardiovascular system (circulatory system) the heart together with two networks of blood vessels – the *systemic circulation and the *pulmonary circulation (see illustration). The cardiovascular system effects the circulation of blood around the body, which brings about transport of nutrients and oxygen to the tissues and the removal of waste products.

Cardiovascular system.





cardioversion (countershock) n. restoration of normal heart rhythm in patients with tachyarrhythmia (see arrhythmia). Electrical (synchronized) cardioversion involves the application of a controlled shock, synchronized with the R wave of the *electrocardiogram, through electrodes placed on the chest wall of the anaesthetized patient. The apparatus is called a cardiovertor and is a modified *defibrillator. It is synchronized (usually by pressing a specific button on the control panel) because inadvertent delivery of the shock at the peak of the T wave can trigger ventricular fibrillation. Pharmacological cardioversion is achieved through oral, or more commonly intravenous, drug administration.

care assistant a person who helps with the general care of a patient, usually assisting a nurse or social worker with care of the vulnerable elderly in the community. Care assistants include home helps.

Care Quality Commission (CQC) a publicly funded independent organization established in 2009 and responsible for regulation of health and social care in England; it replaced the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and the Mental Health Act Commission. The responsibilities of the commission include publication of national health-care standards; annual assessment of the performance of NHS and social-care organizations; reviewing other (i.e. private and voluntary) health- and social-care organizations; reviewing complaints about the services when it has not been possible to resolve them locally; and investigating serious service failures.

carotenaemia n. see xanthaemia.

carotene n. a yellow or orange plant pigment – one of the carotenoids – that occurs in four forms: alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ). The most important form is β-carotene, which is an *antioxidant and can be converted in the body to retinol (vitamin A). Good sources include yellow and green vegetables, such as carrots, sweet potato, and kale.

carotenoid n. any one of a group of about 100 naturally occurring yellow to red pigments found mostly in plants. The group includes the *carotenes.

carotid artery either of the two main arteries in the neck whose branches supply the head and neck. The common carotid artery arises on the left side directly from the aortic arch and on the right from the innominate artery. They ascend the neck on either side as far as the thyroid cartilage (Adam’s apple), where they each divide into two branches, the internal carotid, supplying the cerebrum, forehead, nose, eye, and middle ear, and the external carotid, sending branches to the face, scalp, and neck.

carotid artery stenosis (carotid stenosis) narrowing of the carotid artery, which reduces the supply of blood to the brain and is a cause of strokes. It is treated by surgical excision or bypass of the narrowed segment (see also endarterectomy) or by inserting a *stent into the carotid artery.

carotid body a small mass of tissue in the carotid sinus containing *chemoreceptors that monitor levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions in the blood. If the oxygen level falls, the chemoreceptors send impulses to the cardiac and respiratory centres in the brain, which promote increases in heart and respiration rates. It can give rise to carotid body tumours, which are a form of *paraganglioma.

carotid sinus a pocket in the wall of the carotid artery, at its division in the neck, containing receptors that monitor blood pressure (see baroreceptor). When blood pressure is raised, impulses travel from the receptors to the vasomotor centre in the brain, which initiates a reflex *vasodilatation and slowing of heart rate to lower the blood pressure to normal.

carp- (carpo-) combining form denoting the wrist (carpus).

carpal 1. adj. relating to the wrist. 2. n. any of the bones forming the carpus.

carpal tunnel the space between the carpal bones of the wrist and the connective tissue (retinaculum) over the flexor tendons. It contains the flexor tendons and the median nerve.

carpal tunnel syndrome a combination of *paraesthesia (pins and needles), numbness, and pain in the hand, usually affecting the thumb, index, and middle fingers and sometimes extending to the medial aspect of the fourth finger. The symptoms are usually worse at night, and in longstanding cases there may be weakness of grip due to wasting of the *thenar eminence of the thumb. It is caused by pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the wrist (see carpal tunnel), which may result from any continuous repetitive movements of the hand, such as keyboarding, or any condition causing local swelling. It is common in rheumatoid arthritis, myxoedema, pregnancy, and at the menopause, when it is more likely to be bilateral. Treatment is by splinting of the wrist, *NSAIDs, injection of a steroid, or – in severe cases – by surgical release of the nerve under local anaesthesia.

carphology n. see floccillation.

carpopedal spasm see spasm.

carpus n. the eight bones of the wrist (see illustration). The carpus articulates with the metacarpals distally and with the ulna and radius proximally.

carrier n. 1. a person who harbours the microorganisms causing a particular disease without experiencing signs or symptoms of infection and who can transmit the disease to others. 2. (in genetics) a person who bears a gene for an abnormal trait without showing any signs of the disorder; the carrier is usually *heterozygous for the gene concerned, which is *recessive. 3. an animal, usually an insect, that passively transmits infectious organisms from one animal to another or from an infected animal to a human being. See also vector.

carteolol n. a *beta blocker used as eye drops in the treatment of *glaucoma; side-effects may include local stinging and burning.

cartilage n. a dense connective tissue composed of a matrix produced by cells called chondroblasts, which become embedded in the matrix as chondrocytes. It is a semiopaque grey or white substance, consisting chiefly of *chondroitin sulphate, that is capable of withstanding considerable pressure. There are three types: *hyaline cartilage, *elastic cartilage, and *fibrocartilage (see illustration). In the fetus and infant cartilage occurs in many parts of the body, but most of this cartilage disappears during development. In the adult, hyaline cartilage is found in the costal cartilages, larynx, trachea, bronchi, nose, and covering the surface of bones at joints, where wear and damage results in *osteoarthritis. Elastic cartilage occurs in the external ear, and fibrocartilage in the intervertebral discs and tendons. Cartilage is the precursor of bone following a fracture (see callus).

Types of cartilage.





CARTO Trademark. a system that uses magnetic localization technology to triangulate the position of a small sensor incorporated into the tip of a cardiac catheter. The signals from several catheters inserted simultaneously are used to create an electrical map of the heart from within, identifying abnormal areas where *ablation may be required.

case control study comparison of a group of people with a disease or condition and a control group of people free from that disease (e.g. people diagnosed with lung cancer and people without lung cancer). The groups are compared in terms of the frequency of *variables in their backgrounds (e.g. cigarette smoking). This method can be used to investigate risk factors for diseases. In the more precise matched pair study each individual with the disease is paired with a control matched on the basis of (say) age, sex, and occupation: this places greater emphasis on the factors for which the pairs have not been matched. Compare cross-sectional study, longitudinal study.

case fatality rate the number of fatalities from a specified disease in a given period per 100 diagnosed cases of the disease arising in the same period. Unless deaths occur very rapidly after the onset of the disease (e.g. cholera), they may be the outcome of episodes that started in an earlier period. It is possible for more people to die from a condition than to develop it during the time period under investigation. Different time periods will be appropriate depending on the disease of interest. Comparison of the annual number of admissions and fatalities in a given hospital in respect of a specific disease is known as the hospital fatality rate.

casein n. a milk protein. Casein is precipitated out of milk in acid conditions or by the action of rennin: it is the principal protein of cheese. Casein is very easily prepared and is useful as a protein supplement, particularly in the treatment of malnutrition.

case work see social services.

Casodex n. see bicalutamide.

cassette n. (in radiography) a thin light-proof box in which a piece of photographic film is placed. It usually contains special screens, which fluoresce on exposure to X-rays, intensifying the image formed on photographic film when a radiographic exposure is taken. In *computerized radiography the cassette may contain an electrically charged plate.

cast n. 1. a rigid casing for a limb or other part of the body, made of plaster of Paris, fibreglass, or plastic, that is designed to protect a broken bone and prevent movement of the aligned bone ends until healing has progressed sufficiently. 2. a mass of dead cellular, fatty, and other material that forms within a body cavity and takes its shape. It may then be released and appear elsewhere. For example, *granular casts appearing in the urine indicate kidney disease.

cast nephropathy (myeloma kidney) a complication of multiple myeloma seen in approximately half of those who have renal disease. The casts typically involve the distal convoluted and collecting tubules and often have a fractured or crystalline appearance. They are frequently surrounded by multinucleate giant cells. Deposition of the casts is associated with progressive renal failure.

castration n. removal of the sex glands (the testes or the ovaries). Castration in childhood causes failure of sexual development but when done in adult life (usually as part of hormonal treatment for cancer) it produces less marked physical changes in both sexes. Castration inevitably causes sterility but it need not cause impotence or loss of sexual desire.

casuistry n. 1. case ethics: a method of ethical analysis that examines how the particular circumstances of different cases influence the ways in which general ethical principles should be applied. 2. an excessively subtle misuse of case ethics used to confuse an issue or excuse a culprit.

CAT computerized axial tomography, now referred to as *computerized tomography (CT).

cata- prefix denoting downward or against.

catabolism n. the chemical decomposition of complex substances by the body to form simpler ones, accompanied by the release of energy. The substances broken down include nutrients in food (carbohydrates, proteins, etc.) as well as the body’s storage products (such as glycogen). See also metabolism. —catabolic adj.

catagen n. see anagen.

cataplasia n. degeneration of tissues to an earlier developmental form.

cataplexy n. a sudden onset of muscle weakness that may be precipitated by excitement or emotion. There may be total loss of muscle tone, resulting in collapse, or simply jaw dropping or head nodding. It occurs in 60–90% of patients with *narcolepsy.

cataract n. an opacity in the lens of the eye that may result in blurred vision. Minor degrees of cataract do not necessarily impair vision seriously. Cataracts may be congenital or acquired. The latter are most commonly a result of age (senile cataract); metabolic disease (such as diabetes), injury to the eye, or exposure of the eye to infrared rays (e.g. glass-blowers’ cataract) or ionizing radiation can also cause a cataract. A type commonly related to ageing is nuclear sclerotic cataract, which results from increasing density and yellowing of the centre of the lens. A posterior subcapsular cataract (at the rear surface of the lens within the lens capsule) is also related to ageing but may occur with prolonged use of steroids and chronic ocular inflammation. Brunescent cataracts are dark brown and very dense, and a cortical cataract is one in which the opacity occurs in the soft outer part (cortex) of the lens. A Morgagnian cataract is a longstanding very opaque cataract in which the cortex has started to shrink and liquefy, leaving a central shrunken nucleus.

Cataract is treated by removal of the affected lens (see cataract extraction; phacoemulsification); patients may wear appropriate spectacles or a contact lens to compensate for the missing lens but in modern practice a synthetic intraocular lens implant is routinely placed inside the eye as a part of the surgical procedure.

cataract extraction surgical removal of a cataract from the eye. In extracapsular cataract extraction the cataract alone is removed, leaving the lens capsule behind. Intracapsular cataract extraction is the removal of the whole lens, including the capsule that surrounds it.

catarrh n. the excessive secretion of thick phlegm or mucus by the mucous membrane of the nose, nasal sinuses, nasopharynx, or air passages. The term is not used in any precise or scientific sense.

catastrophic illness a US term for a health condition that severely affects an individual’s physical, mental, social, or economic wellbeing, lasts for an extended period of time, and (usually) requires very expensive treatment. In practice, the definition varies from government agency to agency and from employer to employer. The definition may focus specifically on the economic burden, the time lost from work, the seriousness of the condition, or a combination of these.

catatonia n. a state in which a person becomes mute or stuporous or adopts bizarre postures. The features include waxy flexibility (flexibilitas cerea), in which the limbs may be moved passively by another person into positions that are then retained for hours on end. Other common features include non-goal-directed excitement, *posturing, *negativism, rigidity, and command automatism (automatic compliance with instructions). Catatonia usually occurs in the context of *schizophrenia, but is now rarely seen in developed countries. It remains common in developing countries. Treatment includes high-dose *benzodiazepines and *electroconvulsive therapy. —catatonic adj.

CATCH-22 see di George syndrome.

catchment area the geographic area from which a hospital can expect to receive patients and on which (in Britain) the designated population of the hospital is based. There is no statutory requirement for patients to use the hospital(s) of their area, but a code of zoning practice exists for some specialties (e.g. mental illness). A hospital may have a smaller catchment area for common specialties than for rarer ones, which may be shared between several districts (regional specialty) or regions (supraregional specialty).

catecholamines pl. n. a group of physiologically important substances, including *adrenaline, *noradrenaline, and *dopamine, having various different roles (mainly as *neurotransmitters) in the functioning of the sympathetic and central nervous systems. Chemically, all contain a benzene ring with adjacent hydroxyl groups (catechol) and an amine group on a side chain. Catecholamines act at both alpha (α) and beta (β) *adrenoceptors. Some tumours (e.g. *phaeochromocytoma) secrete excess catecholamines.

categorical imperative see imperative.

catgut n. a natural fibrous material prepared from the tissues of animals, usually from the walls of sheep intestines, twisted into strands of different thicknesses and formerly widely used to sew up wounds (see suture) and tie off blood vessels during surgery. The catgut gradually dissolves and is absorbed by the tissues, so that the stitches do not have to be removed later. Catgut has now been replaced by synthetic absorbable suture material, such as vicryl.

catharsis n. 1. purging or cleansing out of the bowels by giving the patient a *laxative (cathartic) to stimulate intestinal activity. 2. the release of strong pent-up emotions. See abreaction.

Catheters.





catheterization n. the introduction of a *catheter into a hollow organ or vessel. In urethral catheterization a catheter is introduced into the bladder through the urethra to relieve obstruction to the outflow of urine (see also intermittent self-catheterization). Catheters can also be passed above the pubis through the anterior abdominal wall (suprapubic catheterization) directly into a full bladder if urethral catheterization is not possible. Cardiac catheterization entails the introduction of special catheters into the chambers of the heart. This allows the measurement of pressures in the chambers and pressure gradients across the heart valves, as well as the injection of contrast medium for visualization of structures using X-rays (see coronary angiography). Vascular catheterization enables the introduction into the arteries or veins of: (1) contrast medium for angiography or venography; (2) drugs to constrict or expand vessels or to dissolve a thrombus (see thrombolysis); (3) metal coils or other solid materials to block bleeding vessels or to thrombose *aneurysms (see embolization); (4) devices for monitoring pressures within important vessels (e.g. *Swan-Ganz catheters for monitoring pulmonary artery pressure in critically ill patients); or (5) balloons and *stents to relieve obstruction.

cation n. an ion of positive charge, such as a sodium ion (Na+). Compare anion. See electrolyte.

cation-exchange resins complex insoluble chemical compounds that may be administered with the diet to alter the *electrolyte balance of the body in the treatment of heart, kidney, and metabolic disorders. For example, in patients on a strict low-sodium diet such resins combine with sodium in the food so that it cannot be absorbed and passes out in the faeces.

cat-scratch disease an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Bartonella henselae, which infects cats and is transmitted to humans by a cat scratch or bite. A papule or pustule develops at the site of the injury followed, a week to two months after infection, by swelling of the lymph nodes (usually those closest to the wound). Fever and malaise are common. The condition usually resolves without treatment but antibiotics may be given to prevent complications.

cauda n. a tail-like structure. The cauda equina is a bundle of nerve roots from the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spinal nerves that descend nearly vertically from the spinal cord until they reach their respective openings in the vertebral column.

cauda equina syndrome damage to the *cauda equina, the nerve roots arising from the terminal end of the spinal cord, due to trauma or compression. Without urgent surgical intervention, it can result in paralysis, loss of sensation in the legs, and bladder and bowel incontinence.

caudal adj. relating to the lower part or tail end of the body.

caul n. 1. (in obstetrics) the *amnion, either as a piece of membrane that covers an infant’s head at birth or the entire unruptured sac that encloses the fetus during pregnancy. 2. (in anatomy) see omentum.

causal agent a factor associated with the definitive onset of an illness (or other response, including an accident). Examples are bacteria and trauma. The relationship is more direct than in the case of a *risk factor; in general, the ill health only occurs if the agent is a precursor.

causalgia n. an intensely unpleasant burning pain felt in a limb where there has been partial damage to the sympathetic and somatic sensory nerves.

caustic n. an agent, such as silver nitrate, that destroys tissue. Caustic agents may be used to remove dead skin, warts, etc., but care must be taken not to damage the surrounding area.

caustic soda see sodium hydroxide.

cauterize vb. to destroy tissues by direct application of a heated instrument (known as a cautery): used for the removal of small warts or other growths (see also curettage) and also to stop bleeding from small vessels. —cautery n.

Caverject n. see alprostadil.

cavernitis n. inflammation of the corpora cavernosa of the *penis or the corpus cavernosum of the clitoris.

cavernosography n. a radiological examination of the erectile tissue of the penis (see corpus cavernosum) that entails the infusion of *radiopaque contrast medium into the corpora cavernosa via a small butterfly needle. The contrast medium flow rate needed to maintain erection can be measured, and radiographs taken during the procedure give information regarding any abnormality of the veins draining the penis. It is mostly used in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. Cavernosography can also be carried out with ultrasound and ultrasound contrast medium.

cavernosometry n. the measurement of pressure within the corpora cavernosa of the penis during infusion. The flow rate required to produce an erection is recorded and also the flow necessary to maintain the induced erection. The examination is important in the investigation of erectile dysfunction.

cavernous breathing see breath sounds.

cavernous sinus one of the paired cavities within the *sphenoid bone, at the base of the skull behind the eye sockets, into which blood drains from the brain, eye, nose, and upper cheek before leaving the skull through connections with the internal jugular and facial veins. Through the sinus, in its walls, pass the internal carotid artery and the abducens, oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic, and maxillary nerves.

cavity n. 1. (in anatomy) a hollow enclosed area; for example, the abdominal cavity or the buccal cavity (mouth). 2. (in dentistry) a. the hole in a tooth caused by *caries or abrasion. b. the hole shaped in a tooth by a dentist to retain a filling.

cavity varnish (in dentistry) a solution of natural or synthetic resin in an organic solvent. It is used to provide a barrier against the passage of irritants from restorative materials and to reduce the penetration of oral fluids into the underlying *dentine.

cavogram n. an image of the vena cava, either inferior or superior. After injecting a radiographic contrast medium in a peripheral vein, the vena cava can be imaged with X-rays (see fluoroscopy) while the contrast arrives. Alternatively, a catheter can be inserted into a vein and advanced to the vena cava, then the contrast medium is injected to image it. Noninvasive imaging with CT or MRI scan is possible, but the image quality is inferior to fluoroscopic imaging.

CBT see cognitive behavioural therapy.

CBW (chemical and biological warfare) the use of poisonous gases and other chemicals, bacteria, viruses, and toxins during war.

cell n. the basic unit of all living organisms, which can reproduce itself exactly (see mitosis). Each cell is bounded by a cell membrane of lipids and protein, which controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell. Cells contain *cytoplasm, in which are suspended a *nucleus and other structures (*organelles) specialized to carry out particular activities in the cell (see illustration).

Complex organisms are built up of millions of cells that are specially adapted to carry out particular functions. The process of cell differentiation begins early on in the development of the embryo and cells of a particular type (e.g. blood cells, liver cells) always give rise to cells of the same type. Each cell has a particular number of *chromosomes in its nucleus. The sex cells (sperm and ova) always contain half the number of chromosomes of all the other cells of the body (see meiosis); at fertilization a sperm and ovum combine to form a cell with a complete set of chromosomes that will develop into the embryo.

cellophane maculopathy see epiretinal membrane.

cell saver a machine that aspirates blood lost during surgery and immediately spins, washes, and filters it for retransfusion back into the patient’s body (see autotransfusion). The process, called intraoperative cell salvage, is used in surgery that has significant blood loss, such as orthopaedic and vascular surgery and Caesarean section, and avoids the costs and risks of *allogeneic transfusion.

cell-surface molecules molecules on the surface of cell membranes that are responsible for most cellular functions directly related to their immediate environment. Many have very precise functions of adhesion (see adhesion molecules), metabolic exchange, hormone reception, respiration, and immune reactions. Cell-to-cell exchanges involve specialized surface structures (junctions), which form a communicating nexus.

cellulitis n. an infection of the deep layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissue by staphylococci, streptococci, or other bacteria. The patient is systemically unwell and feverish. It is most common on the lower legs and there may be associated *lymphangitis and *lymphadenitis. It is otherwise similar to *erysipelas, but the margins are less clearly defined because the infection is deeper. Intravenous antibiotics are often required.

cellulose n. a carbohydrate consisting of linked glucose units. It is an important constituent of plant cell walls. Cellulose cannot be digested by humans and is a component of *dietary fibre (roughage).

Celsius temperature (centigrade temperature) temperature expressed on a scale in which the melting point of ice is assigned a temperature of 0° and the boiling point of water a temperature of 100°. For many medical purposes this scale has superseded the Fahrenheit scale (see Fahrenheit temperature). The formula for converting from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) is: F = 9/5C + 32. [A. Celsius (1701–44), Swedish astronomer]

cement n. 1. any of a group of materials used in dentistry either as fillings or as *lutes for crowns. *Glass ionomer cements are used for filling, whereas zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, and glass ionomer cements are used for luting. Zinc oxide–eugenol cements are widely used as temporary fillings or as an impression material. Advances in bonding have resulted in the development of universal resin cements that may be chemical curing or light-cured. 2.

cementum (cement) n. a thin layer of hard tissue that covers the whole surface of the root of a *tooth. It attaches the fibres of the *periodontal membrane to the tooth.

censor n. (in psychology) the mechanism, postulated by Freud, that suppresses or modifies desires that are inappropriate or feared. The censor is usually regarded as being located in the *superego, but was also described by Freud as being in the *ego itself.

census n. an official count of the population within a defined territory, together with information on such attributes as age, sex, etc. In the UK it takes the form of a ten-yearly enumeration of the population based on the actual presence of individuals in a house or institution on a designated night (known as a de facto census). This contrasts with the approach in the USA, where enumeration is based on official address (de jure census).

-centesis combining form denoting puncture or perforation. Example: amniocentesis (surgical puncture of the amnion).

centi- prefix denoting one hundredth or a hundred.

centigrade temperature see Celsius temperature.

centile chart a graph with lines showing average measurements of height, weight, and head circumference compared with age and sex, against which the physical development of a child or fetus can be assessed. The lines of growth on the graph are called centiles, and the number of a centile predicts the percentage of individuals who are below that measurement for a given age; for example, the 10th centile means that 10% of the age- and sex-matched population will be smaller and 90% will be bigger. A child or fetus will normally follow a particular centile, but if growth crosses centiles or lies outside the 97th or 3rd centiles, further investigation may be warranted.

central auditory processing disorder see auditory processing disorder.

central island an area of significant irregular astigmatism seen on *corneal topography after laser refractive surgery. It may affect the postoperative outcome.

central nervous system (CNS) the *brain and the *spinal cord, as opposed to the cranial and spinal nerves and the *autonomic nervous system, which together form the peripheral nervous system. The CNS is responsible for the *integration of all nervous activities.

central serous chorioretinopathy shallow *retinal detachment in the area of the macula due to a localized leakage through the retinal pigment epithelium (see retina) into the subretinal space. The cause is unknown. It affects young adult males, causing reduced or distorted central vision that usually settles in a few months.

central venous catheter an intravenous catheter for insertion directly into a large vein, most commonly the subclavian vein, during its passage under the clavicle, or the jugular in the neck. Such catheters can also be inserted into the femoral vein at the groin. They enable intravenous drugs and fluids to be given and intravenous pressures to be measured, which is often useful during operations or in intensive care. Central venous catheters must be inserted under strictly sterile conditions using a local anaesthetic.

central venous pressure (CVP) the pressure of blood within the right atrium. Measurement of CVP is obtained by *catheterization of the right side of the heart; the catheter is attached to a manometer. CVP measurements are used to estimate circulatory function and blood volume in cases of shock or severe haemorrhage and to monitor blood replacement. In a recumbent patient, with the zero point of the manometer level with the mid-axilla (centre of the armpit), CVP should measure between 5 and 8 cm saline under normal conditions. In clinical practice the CVP is often estimated by inspecting the *jugular venous pressure (JVP).

centre n. (in neurology) a collection of neurons (nerve cells) whose activities control a particular function. The respiratory and cardiovascular centres, for example, are regions in the lower brainstem that control the movements of respiration and the functioning of the circulatory system, respectively.

centriole n. a small particle found in the cytoplasm of cells, near the nucleus. Centrioles are involved in the formation of the *spindle and aster during cell division. During interphase there are usually two centrioles in the *centrosome; when cell division occurs these separate and move to opposite sides of the nucleus, and the spindle is formed between them.

centripetal adj. moving towards a centre, as from the peripheral tissues to the brain.

centromere (kinetochore) n. the part of a chromosome that joins the two *chromatids to each other and becomes attached to the spindle during *mitosis and *meiosis. When chromosome division takes place the centromeres split longitudinally.

It is most commonly seen in newborn infants delivered with the aid of forceps or vacuum extraction or subjected to pressures during passage through the birth canal. No treatment is necessary and the swelling disappears in a few months. If it is extensive, the blood in the fluid may break down, releasing bilirubin into the bloodstream and causing *jaundice. A cephalhaematoma in an older baby or child is evidence of some recent injury to the head; occasionally an unsuspected fracture is revealed on X-ray. See also chignon; subaponeurotic haemorrhage.

cephalic adj. of or relating to the head.

cephalic index a measure of the shape of a skull, commonly used in *craniometry: the ratio of the greatest breadth, multiplied by 100, to the greatest length of the skull. See also brachycephaly; dolichocephaly.

cephalic version (external cephalic version) a procedure in which a fetus that is lying in the breech position is turned so that its head will enter the birth canal first. It may give rise to complications (e.g. abruptio placentae) and is therefore only carried out in selected cases.

cephalin n. one of a group of *phospholipids that are constituents of cell membranes and are particularly abundant in the brain.

cephalocele n. see neural tube defects.

cephalogram n. a special standardized X-ray picture of the craniofacial area that can be used to measure alterations in the growth of skull bones, as used especially during orthodontic treatment. A lateral cephalometric radiograph is used to analyse skeletal, dentoalveolar, and soft tissue relationships in the anteroposterior and vertical dimensions.

cephalometry n. the study and measurement of facial growth by examination of standardized lateral cephalometric radiographs of the head. It is used mainly for diagnosis in *orthodontics.

cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) the state in which the diameter of the fetal head is greater than the pelvic outlet, preventing successful vaginal delivery. This may be relative when there is *malposition of the vertex (back of the head) or absolute when the vertex is in the occipitoanterior position (see occiput), and can only be considered when the cervix is fully dilated.

cephalosporin n. any one of a group of semisynthetic *beta-lactam antibiotics, derived from the mould Cephalosporium, which are effective against a wide range of microorganisms and are therefore used in a variety of infections. The older (first-generation) cephalosporins include *cefadroxil and *cefalexin; more recent (second-generation) drugs include *cefaclor and *cefuroxime. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as *ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, have greater activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Cross-sensitivity with penicillin may occur and the principal side-effects are allergic reactions and irritation of the digestive tract.

CERA see cortical evoked response audiometry.

cercaria n. (pl. cercariae) the final larval stage of any parasitic trematode (see fluke). The cercariae, which have tails but otherwise resemble the adults, are released into water from the snail host in which the parasite undergoes part of its development. Several thousand cercariae may emerge from a single snail in a day.

cerebellum n. the largest part of the hindbrain, bulging back behind the pons and the medulla oblongata and overhung by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. Like the cerebrum, it has an outer grey cortex and a core of white matter. Three broad bands of nerve fibres – the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles – connect it to the medulla, the pons, and the midbrain respectively. It has two hemispheres, one on each side of the central region (the vermis), and its surface is thrown into thin folds called folia (see illustration). Within lie four pairs of nuclei.

The cerebellum (anterior view).





The cerebellum is essential for the maintenance of muscle tone, balance, and the synchronization of activity in groups of muscles under voluntary control, converting muscular contractions into smooth coordinated movement. It does not, however, initiate movement and plays no part in the perception of conscious sensations or in intelligence. —cerebellar adj.

cerebr- (cerebri-, cerebro-) combining form denoting the cerebrum or brain.

cerebral abscess see abscess.

cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) the narrow channel, containing cerebrospinal fluid, that connects the third and fourth *ventricles of the brain.

cerebral cortex the intricately folded outer layer of the *cerebrum, making up some 40% of the brain by weight and composed of an estimated 15 thousand million neurons (see grey matter). This is the part of the brain most directly responsible for consciousness, with essential roles in perception, memory, thought, mental ability, and intellect, and it is responsible for initiating voluntary activity. It has connections, direct or indirect, with all parts of the body. The folding of the cortex provides a large surface area, the greater part lying in the clefts (sulci), which divide the upraised convolutions (gyri). On the basis of its microscopic appearance in section, the cortex is mapped into *Brodmann areas; it is also divided into functional regions; including *motor cortex, *sensory cortex, and *association areas. Within, and continuous with it, lies the *white matter, through which connection is made with the rest of the nervous system.

cerebral haemorrhage bleeding from a cerebral blood vessel into the tissue of the brain. It is commonly caused by degenerative disease of the arteries and high blood pressure but it may result from bleeding from congenital abnormalities of blood vessels. The extent and severity of the symptoms depend upon the site and volume of the haemorrhage; they vary from a transient weakness or numbness to profound coma and death. See also atheroma; hypertension; stroke.

cerebral hemisphere one of the two paired halves of the *cerebrum.

cerebral palsy a disorder of movement and/or posture as a result of nonprogressive but permanent damage to the developing brain. This damage may occur before, during, or immediately after delivery and has many causes, including an inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain, low levels of glucose in the blood (*hypoglycaemia), and infection. It is often associated with other problems, such as learning difficulties, hearing difficulties, poor speech, poor balance, and epilepsy. There are three main types of cerebral palsy: spastic, in which the limbs are difficult to control and which may affect the whole body (quadriplegic), one side of the body (hemiplegic), or both legs (diplegic); ataxic hypotonic, in which the main problem is poor balance and uncoordinated movements; and dyskinetic, in which there is involuntary movement of the limbs. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, the main components of which are physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, educational assistance, and appropriate appliances.

cerebral tumour an abnormal multiplication of brain cells. Any tumorous swelling tends to compress or even destroy the healthy brain cells surrounding it and – because of the rigid closed nature of the skull – increases the pressure on the brain tissue. Malignant brain tumours, which are much more common in children than in adults, include *medulloblastomas and *gliomas; these grow rapidly, spreading through the otherwise normal brain tissue and causing progressive neurological disability. Benign tumours, such as *meningiomas, grow slowly and compress the brain tissue. Both benign and malignant tumours commonly cause fits. Benign tumours are often cured by total surgical resection. Malignant tumours may be treated by neurosurgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, but the outcome for most patients remains poor.

cerebral venous sinus thrombosis the presence of thrombosis in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke (such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body), and seizures. Treatment is with anticoagulants.

cerebration n. 1. the functioning of the brain as a whole. 2. the unconscious activities of the brain.

cerebroside n. one of a group of compounds occurring in the *myelin sheaths of nerve fibres. They are *glycolipids, containing a sphingolipid bound to a sugar, usually galactose (in galactocerebrosides) or glucose (in glucocerebrosides).

cerebrospinal fever (spotted fever) see meningitis.

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear watery fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is contained in the *subarachnoid space and circulates in the *ventricles of the brain and in the central canal of the spinal cord. The brain floats in the fluid (its weight so being reduced from about 1400 g to less than 100 g) and is cushioned by it from contact with the skull when the head is moved vigorously. The CSF is secreted by the *choroid plexuses in the ventricles, circulates through them to reach the subarachnoid space, and is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream through the *arachnoid villi. Its normal contents are glucose, salts, enzymes, and a few white cells, but no red blood cells. See Appendix 5.

cerebrovascular disease any disorder of the blood vessels of the brain and its covering membranes (meninges). Most cases are due to atheroma and/or hypertension, clinical effects being caused by rupture of diseased blood vessels (*cerebral or *subarachnoid haemorrhage) or inadequacy of the blood supply to the brain (ischaemia), due to cerebral thrombosis or embolism. The term cerebrovascular accident is given to the clinical syndrome accompanying a sudden and sometimes severe attack, which leads to a *stroke.

cerebrum (telencephalon) n. the largest and most highly developed part of the brain, composed of the two cerebral hemispheres, separated from each other by the longitudinal fissure in the midline (see illustration). Each hemisphere has an outer layer of grey matter, the *cerebral cortex, below which lies white matter containing the *basal ganglia. Connecting the two hemispheres at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure is the corpus callosum, a massive bundle of nerve fibres. Within each hemisphere is a crescent-shaped fluid-filled cavity (lateral *ventricle), connected to the central third ventricle in the *diencephalon. The cerebrum is responsible for the initiation and coordination of all voluntary activity in the body and for governing the functioning of lower parts of the nervous system. The cortex is the seat of all intelligent behaviour. —cerebral adj.

Lobes of the cerebrum (from the right side).





cerumen (earwax) n. the waxy material that is secreted by the sebaceous glands in the external auditory meatus of the outer ear. Its function is to protect the delicate skin that lines the inside of the meatus.

cervic- (cervico-) combining form denoting 1. the neck. Example: cervicodynia (pain in). 2. the cervix, especially of the uterus. Example: cervicectomy (surgical removal of).

cervical adj. 1. of or relating to the neck. 2. of, relating to, or affecting the cervix (neck region) of an organ, especially the cervix of the uterus.

cervical cancer (cervical carcinoma) cancer of the neck (cervix) of the uterus. The tumour may develop from the surface epithelium of the cervix (squamous carcinoma) or from the epithelial lining of the cervical canal (adenocarcinoma). In both cases the tumour is invasive, spreading to involve surrounding tissue and subsequently to neighbouring lymph nodes and adjacent organs, such as the bladder and rectum. Cancer of the cervix can be detected in an early stage of development (see cervical screening) and diagnosis is established by biopsy (see colposcopy). In carcinoma in situ (see cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) the tumour is confined to the epithelium: there is no invasion of surrounding tissue but, if untreated (by local ablation, *LLETZ, or surgical excision), it can become invasive. Common early features of invasive disease are abnormal vaginal bleeding and a foul-smelling blood-stained vaginal discharge. Treatment is by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy. See also human papillomavirus.

cervical cerclage a procedure to help prevent *preterm delivery. It involves inserting a purse-string suture around the cervix of the uterus between 12 and 14 weeks gestation, either transvaginally or transabdominally, to keep the cervix closed and reduce the possibility of preterm cervical dilatation and rupture of membranes.

cervical ectopy see ectropion.

cervical fracture a fracture of a vertebra in the neck (see cervical vertebrae). Cervical fractures range from minor, requiring no treatment, to those associated with paralysis and instant death. Treatment can be support with a collar, skull traction, an *orthosis attached to the skull, or surgery, depending on the severity of the fracture.

cervical incompetence spontaneous dilatation of the cervix of the uterus during the second trimester of pregnancy. The membranes bulge and subsequently rupture, and the fetus is expelled prematurely in a late miscarriage. It may be caused by forcible dilatation of the cervix during the operation of *dilatation and curettage or it may be related to laceration of the cervix during a previous delivery or to previous cervical surgical procedures (e.g. knife *cone biopsy).

cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cellular changes in the cervix of the uterus preceding the invasive stages of *cervical cancer. The CIN grading system distinguishes three stages: CIN 1 (mild dysplasia); CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia); and CIN 3 (severe dysplasia, *carcinoma in situ). CIN is uncommon after the menopause. Treatment may be by local ablation (e.g. cold coagulation (applying a heated probe to the *transformation zone), cryocautery, electrodiathermy, or carbon dioxide *laser vaporization) or by surgical excision (e.g. *LLETZ, *cone biopsy, or hysterectomy).

cervical resistance index measurement of the resistance of the cervix during the passage of a series of metal (Hegar) dilators. Lack of resistance in a nonpregnant women may suggest cervical weakness when she has experienced a previous second-trimester pregnancy loss or if she has had previous surgery to the cervix, and may indicate *cervical cerclage in the event of future pregnancies.

cervical screening *screening tests to detect the presence of precancerous changes in the cervix (neck) of the uterus (see cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). *Cervical smears are the standard first-line screening tools in most countries: screening programmes based on the traditional Papanicolaou (Pap) test have been mostly superseded by *liquid-based cytology. *Colposcopy is indicated when abnormal cells (*dyskaryosis) are detected.

cervical smear a specimen of cellular material scraped from the *transformation zone of the cervix (neck) of the uterus that is stained and examined under a microscope in order to detect cell abnormalities indicating the presence of precancerous change. See cervical screening.

cervical vertebrae the seven bones making up the neck region of the *backbone. The first cervical vertebra – the atlas – consists basically of a ring of bone that supports the skull by articulating with the occipital condyles (see occipital bone). The second vertebra – the axis – has an upward-pointing process (the odontoid process or dens) that forms a pivot on which the atlas can rotate, enabling the head to be turned. See also vertebra.

cervicitis n. inflammation of the neck (cervix) of the uterus.

cervix n. a necklike part, especially the cervix uteri (neck of the uterus), which projects at its lower end into the vagina. The cervical canal passes through it, linking the cavity of the uterus with the vagina; the canal is lined with mucous membrane (see endocervix) and normally contains mucus, the viscosity of which changes throughout the menstrual cycle. The cervix is capable of wide dilation during childbirth.

cestode n. see tapeworm.

cetirizine n. see antihistamine.

cetrimide n. a detergent disinfectant used alone or in combination for cleansing skin surfaces and wounds, for treating minor burns and abrasions, and as an ingredient of *barrier creams for napkin rash and pressure sores. There are few adverse reactions from external application; most toxic effects are due to poisoning from ingestion.

cetuximab n. a drug (a *monoclonal antibody) that acts as an inhibitor of *epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), preventing tumour-cell growth. It is used, in combination with other agents, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and, in combination with radiotherapy, in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

CFA cryptogenic fibrosing *alveolitis.

CFS/ME/PVF a condition, known variously as chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy), or postviral fatigue syndrome, characterized by extreme disabling fatigue that has lasted for at least six months, is made worse by physical or mental exertion, does not resolve with bed rest, and cannot be attributed to other disorders. The fatigue is accompanied by at least some of the following: muscle pain or weakness (*fibromyalgia), poor coordination, joint pain, recurrent sore throat, slight fever, painful lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, depression, cognitive impairment (especially an inability to concentrate), and general malaise. The cause is unknown, but in some cases some viral conditions (especially glandular fever) are thought to trigger the disease; however, no viral aetiology has yet been identified. Treatment is restricted to relieving the symptoms and helping sufferers to plan their lives with a minimum of energy expenditure. Graded physiotherapy may be helpful in some cases. Many psychiatrists consider CFS/ME/PVF to be a mood disorder and use behavioural and cognitive techniques as well as antidepressants to treat it.

CGI see Clinical Global Impression.

Chagas’ disease a disease caused by the protozoan parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi. It is transmitted to humans when the trypanosomes, present in the faeces of nocturnal bloodsucking *reduviid bugs, come into contact with wounds and scratches on the skin or the delicate internal tissues of the nose and mouth. The presence of the parasite in the heart muscles and central nervous system results in serious inflammation and lesions, which can prove fatal. The disease, limited to poor rural areas of South and Central America, is especially prevalent in children and young adults. It may be treated with nifurtimox. See also trypanosomiasis. [C. Chagas (1879–1934), Brazilian physician]

chaining n. (in psychology) a technique of *behaviour modification in which a complex skill is taught by being broken down into its separate components, which are gradually built up into the full sequence. Usually the last component in the sequence is taught first, because it is this component that is followed by *reinforcement: this is termed backwards chaining.

chalazion (meibomian cyst) n. a swollen sebaceous (meibomian) gland in the eyelid caused by blockage of its duct. The gland becomes inflamed and converted into a jelly-like mass, producing disfigurement of the lid. It may disappear spontaneously over a period of time but treatment by application of antibiotic ointments and/or surgical incision and curettage will result in its rapid cure.

chalcosis n. the deposition of copper in the tissues of the eye, usually resulting from the presence of a copper foreign body within the eye.

chancre n. a painless ulcer that develops at the site where infection enters the body, e.g. on the lips, penis, urethra, or eyelid. It is the primary symptom of such infections as sleeping sickness and syphilis.

chancroid n. see soft sore.

channelopathy n. an inherited condition predisposing to arrhythmia that is characterized by a genetic mutation affecting one of the cell membrane channels responsible for transport of ions (e.g. potassium or sodium) into or out of the cardiac cells.

Charcot–Leyden crystals fine colourless sharp-pointed crystals seen in the sputum of asthmatics. [J. M. Charcot (1825–93), French neurologist; E. V. von Leyden (1832–1910), German physician]

Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (peroneal muscular atrophy) a group of inherited diseases of the peripheral nerves, also known as hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy, causing a gradually progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles of the legs and the lower part of the thighs. The hands and arms are eventually affected. The genetic defect responsible for the most common form, type Ia, is a duplication on chromosome 17. The diagnosis is made by nerve conduction tests followed by genetic blood tests. [J. M. Charcot; P. Marie (1853–1940), French physician; H. H. Tooth (1856–1925), British physician]

Charcot’s joint see neuropathic arthritis. [J. M. Charcot]

Charcot’s triad the combination of pain in the right upper quadrant (see abdomen), fever, and jaundice that is seen in acute *cholangitis. [J. M. Charcot]

charity patients in the USA, very low-income patients who receive health care free or at reduced prices; criteria for eligibility differ from state to state, hospital to hospital, and physician to physician. Providers of charity care may be reimbursed through *Medicaid, *Medicare, or other government programmes. So-called medically indigent patients may also be eligible for help. These are patients who earn too much to qualify for charity care but not enough to afford health insurance, and who may incur medical bills that are far beyond their means. The *Affordable Care Act 2010 was intended largely to help those in this position.

Charnley clamps an apparatus used to encourage *arthrodesis between the ends of two bones on either side of a joint. Parallel pins driven through the bone ends are connected on each side of the joint by bolts bearing wing nuts; tightening of the screw arrangements forces the surfaces of the bones together. When the two bones have joined, by growth and reshaping, the clamps can be removed. [Sir J. Charnley (1911–82), British orthopaedic surgeon]

CHART n. continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy: a radiotherapy technique aimed at the rapid destruction of tumour cells when they are actively proliferating – and therefore most sensitive to radiation – by treating them several times a day over a greatly shortened total treatment time. The technique has been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of lung cancer.

Chediak–Higashi syndrome a rare fatal hereditary (autosomal *recessive) condition causing enlargement of the liver and spleen, albinism, and abnormalities of the eye. It is thought to be due to a disorder of glycolipid metabolism. [A. Chediak (20th century), Cuban physician; O. Higashi (20th century) Japanese paediatrician]

cheil- (cheilo-) combining form denoting the lip(s). Example: cheiloplasty (plastic surgery of).

cheilectomy n. a surgical procedure involving the removal of *osteophytes from around a degenerate joint to regain further range of motion. It is commonly performed in degenerative arthritis of the big toe (see hallux rigidus).

cheilitis n. inflammation of the lips. Angular cheilitis affects the angles of the lips and may be caused by a staphylococcal or candidal infection, though mechanical, nutritional, and immune factors may be implicated.

cheiloplasty n. see labioplasty.

cheiloschisis n. see cleft lip.

cheilosis n. swollen cracked bright-red lips. This is a common symptom of many nutritional disorders, including ariboflavinosis (vitamin B2 deficiency).

cheir- (cheiro-) combining form denoting the hand(s). Examples: cheiralgia (pain in); cheiroplasty (plastic surgery of).

cheiroarthropathy n. the restricted hand movement seen in long-standing diabetes. Due to chronic thickening of the skin limiting joint flexibility, it is part of the *diabetic hand syndrome.

cheiropompholyx (acute vesicular eczema of the hands) n. a type of blistering *eczema affecting the palms and fingers. The thickness of the skin in these areas prevents the pinhead vesicles from breaking and eventually the skin peels after a period of intense itching. See pompholyx.

chelating agent a chemical compound whose molecules form complexes by binding metal ions. Some chelating agents, including *desferrioxamine and *penicillamine, are drugs used to treat metal poisoning: the metal is bound to the drug and excreted safely. Chelating agents often form the active centres of enzymes. The chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used in dentistry to remove the *smear layer before root canal filling.

chem- (chemo-) combining form denoting chemical or chemistry.

chemodectoma n. a former name for *paraganglioma.

chemoembolization n. a procedure in which the blood supply to a tumour is blocked with a synthetic embolic agent and cytotoxic drugs are then administered directly into the tumour. It is most frequently used for the treatment of liver cancer. See also transarterial chemoembolization.

chemokine n. any one of a group of small proteins that guide leucocytes to sites of infection and are vital for immune function. They fall into two main classes, CC chemokines and CXC chemokines; receptors (denoted R) are named after the class that bind to them, and subtypes of each class are indicated by numbers (e.g. CCR5).

chemoradiotherapy n. the use of concurrent chemotherapy as a *radiosensitizer and radical irradiation in the treatment of malignant disease. Combined treatment in this way offers higher response rates, particularly in some gastrointestinal malignancies, such as rectal cancer and (particularly) anal cancer. It is also of proven benefit in locally advanced squamous cancers, such as those arising from the head and neck region or the cervix of the uterus.

chemoreceptor n. a cell or group of cells that responds to the presence of specific chemical compounds by initiating an impulse in a sensory nerve. Chemoreceptors are found in the taste buds and in the mucous membranes of the nose. See also receptor.

chemosis n. swelling (oedema) of the *conjunctiva. It is usually due to inflammation but may occur if the drainage of blood and lymph from around the eye is obstructed.

chemotaxis n. movement of a cell or organism in response to the stimulus of a gradient of chemical concentration.

chemotherapy n. the prevention or treatment of disease by the use of chemical substances. The term is increasingly restricted to the treatment of cancer with antimetabolites and similar drugs (see cytotoxic drug) in contrast to *radiotherapy, but is also still sometimes used for antibiotic and other treatment of infectious diseases.

cherry angioma see angioma.

chest n. see thorax.

Cheyne–Stokes respiration a striking form of breathing in which there is a cyclical variation in the rate, which becomes slower until breathing stops for several seconds before speeding up to a peak and then slowing again. It occurs when the sensitivity of the respiratory centres in the brain is impaired, particularly in states of coma. [J. Cheyne (1777–1836), Scottish physician; W. Stokes (1804–78), Irish physician]

chiasma n. (pl. chiasmata) (in genetics) the point at which homologous chromosomes remain in contact after they have started to separate in the first division of *meiosis. Chiasmata occur from the end of prophase to anaphase and represent the point at which mutual exchange of genetic material takes place (see crossing over).

chickenpox n. a highly infectious disease caused by a *herpesvirus (the varicella-zoster virus) that is transmitted by airborne droplets. After an incubation period of 11–18 days a mild fever develops, followed after about 24 hours by an itchy rash of red pimples that soon change to vesicles. These usually start on the trunk or scalp and spread to the face and limbs; they crust over and resolve after about 12 days. Treatment is aimed at reducing the fever and controlling the itching (e.g. by the application of calamine lotion). Complications are rare but include secondary infection and occasionally *encephalitis. The patient is infectious from two days before the spots appear until they all scab over, usually five days after they first appeared. One attack usually confers life-long immunity, although the virus may reactivate at a later date and cause shingles (see herpes). In adult patients who are particularly vulnerable, e.g. those with AIDS or who are otherwise immunosuppressed, chickenpox can be a serious disease, which may be treated with *aciclovir. Medical name: varicella.

chiclero’s ulcer a form of *leishmaniasis of the skin caused by the parasite Leishmania tropica mexicana. The disease, occurring in Panama, Honduras, and the Amazon, primarily affects men who visit the forests to collect chicle (gum) and takes the form of an ulcerating lesion on the ear lobe. The sore usually heals spontaneously within six months.

Chief Medical Officer (CMO) the most senior medical adviser to the UK government, who is responsible for providing expert advice on health issues (including health-related emergencies). The CMO is responsible to the Secretary of State for Health and acts as leader of profession for Directors of Public Health. There are separate CMOs appointed to advise the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Chief Nursing Officer the UK government’s chief nursing adviser, who is responsible for providing an expert professional contribution and advice on nursing, midwifery, and health visiting matters to ministers and senior officials. There are separate Chief Nursing Officers appointed to advise the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

chigger n. see Trombicula.

chignon n. a temporary swelling on the head seen in newborn infants delivered with the aid of vacuum suction. See also cephalhaematoma; subaponeurotic haemorrhage.

chigoe n. see Tunga.

chikungunya fever a disease caused by an *arbovirus and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus Aëdes. The disease is similar to *dengue and symptoms include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, and an irritating rash. The patient is given drugs to relieve the pain and reduce the fever; the joint pain, which may progress to arthritis, can persist for up to three years after the infection. Chikungunya was first reported in Tanzania in 1952 and has since occurred in over sixty countries worldwide.

chilblains (perniosis) pl. n. dusky red itchy swellings that develop on the extremities in cold weather. They usually settle in two weeks but treatment with *nifedipine is helpful in severe cases. There may be a genetic predisposition to chilblains.

child abuse the maltreatment of children. It may take the form of sexual abuse, when a child is involved in sexual activity by an adult; physical abuse, when physical injury is caused by cruelty or undue punishment (see nonaccidental injury); neglect, when basic physical provision for needs is lacking; and emotional abuse, when lack of affection and/or hostility from caregivers damage a child’s emotional development (see attachment disorder).

childbirth n. see labour.

child health clinic (in Britain) a special clinic for the routine care of infants and preschool children, formerly known as a child welfare centre. Sometimes these clinics are staffed by doctors, *health visitors, and clinic nurses; the children attending them are drawn from the neighbourhood around the clinic. Alternatively, general practitioners may run their own child health clinic on a regular basis, with health visitors and other staff in attendance; it is unusual for children not registered with the practice to attend such clinics. The service provides screening tests for such conditions as *congenital dislocation of the hip, suppressed squint (see cover test), and impaired speech and/or hearing. The *Guthrie test may also be performed if this has not been done before the baby leaves hospital. The staff of child health clinics also educate mothers (especially those having their first child) in feeding techniques and hygiene and see that children receive the recommended immunizations against infectious diseases. They also ensure that the families of children with disabilities receive maximum support from health and social services and that such children achieve their maximum potential in the preschool period. See also community paediatrician.

child protection register (in Britain) a confidential list of children whose social circumstances render them at risk of neglect or abuse. Each local authority maintains a register of children who are subject to a child protection plan, who will receive extra support and surveillance from health and/or social services. See also safeguarding.

Children’s Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS) a questionnaire designed to assess children’s hearing abilities in certain situations. It is used in the diagnosis of *auditory processing disorder.

children’s centre (Sure Start Children’s Centre) a building housing a range of services to support children up to five years of age and their families, including childcare, early education, parenting advice, and access to health advice. Over 3 000 ‘Sure Start’-branded Children’s Centres were established under Labour governments from 1997 to 2010. Many centres have subsequently closed, with the result that provision is no longer universal across the UK. See also health inequalities.

Child–Turcotte–Pugh score a clinical scoring system used to predict the one- and two-year survival rates of patients with chronic liver disease. The score is determined by the assessment of two clinical signs (the presence of ascites and *hepatic encephalopathy) and three biochemical markers (serum bilirubin level, serum albumin level, and prothrombin time).

Chinese herb nephropathy a condition that came to prominence in the 1990s when hundreds of young European women developed end-stage renal disease after receiving slimming pills containing Chinese herbs. The condition is also associated with a high incidence of urothelial tumours. It was eventually proved that the product was contaminated with aristolochic acid, a main toxic product of *Aristolochia plant species. Its presence in the slimming regimen was the result of accidental substitution of the prescribed herb Stephania tetrandra (han fang-ji) by A. fangchi (guang fang-ji).

chir- (chiro-) combining form denoting the hand(s). See also cheir-.

chiropody n. see podiatry. —chiropodist n.

chiropractic n. a system of treating diseases by manipulation, mainly of the vertebrae of the backbone. It is based on the theory that nearly all disorders can be traced to the incorrect alignment of bones, with consequent malfunctioning of nerves and muscle throughout the body. Practitioners in the UK are required to register at the General Chiropractic Council, set up in 1997 to regulate the profession.

chi-square test (in statistics) a test to determine if the difference between two groups of observations is statistically significant (see significance), used in controlled trials and other studies. It measures the differences between theoretical and observed values and identifies whether or not *variables are related.

Chlamydia n. a genus of Gram-negative bacteria that are *obligate intracellular parasites in humans and other animals, in which they cause disease. Chlamydia psittaci causes *psittacosis, and C. trachomatis is the causative agent of the eye disease *trachoma. Some strains of Chlamydia, especially C. trachomatis, are a common cause of sexually transmitted infections, being responsible for nonspecific *urethritis in men, *pelvic inflammatory disease in women, and *inclusion conjunctivitis in the newborn. C. pneumoniae causes pneumonia. —chlamydial adj.

chloasma (melasma) n. ill-defined symmetrical brown patches on the cheeks or elsewhere on the face. Chloasma is a *photosensitivity reaction in women on combined oral contraceptive pills or who are pregnant; very rarely it occurs in men. It can usually be prevented by the use of sunscreens and may be treated with bleaching creams.

chlor- (chloro-) combining form denoting 1. chlorine or chlorides. 2. green.

chloracne n. an occupational acne-like skin disorder that occurs after regular contact with chlorinated hydrocarbons. These chemicals are derived from oil and tar products; ‘cutting oils’ used in engineering also cause the disease. The skin develops blackheads, papules, and pustules, mainly on hairy parts (such as the forearm). Warts and skin cancer may develop after many years of exposure to these chemicals.

chloral hydrate a sedative and hypnotic drug formerly widely used (as an oral solution) to induce sleep, mainly in children and the elderly; its derivative cloral betaine (Welldorm) is formulated as an elixir or tablets. Nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal side-effects limit the use of these drugs. Prolonged use may lead to *dependence.

chlorambucil n. an *alkylating agent used in chemotherapy, mainly in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and some lymphomas. Prolonged large doses may cause damage to the bone marrow.

chloramphenicol n. an antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and also produced synthetically, that is effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. However, due to its serious side-effects, especially damage to the bone marrow, it is usually reserved for serious infections (especially those caused by *Haemophilus influenzae) when less toxic drugs are ineffective. Chloramphenicol is also used in the form of eye drops to treat superficial eye infections.

chlordiazepoxide n. a *benzodiazepine drug with *muscle relaxant properties, used for the short-term relief of anxiety and to lessen the severity of symptoms in alcohol withdrawal. Side-effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, and shaky movements.

chlorhexidine n. an antiseptic widely used as a solution to disinfect and cleanse the skin (especially before surgery), wounds, and burns. It is also used in the form of a mouthwash, gel, or spray for treating gingivitis and mouth ulcers and as a solution for washing out urinary catheters and treating some bladder infections. Skin sensitivity to chlorhexidine occurs rarely.

chlorination n. the addition of noninjurious amounts of chlorine (often one part per million) to water supplies before human consumption to ensure that harmful microorganisms are destroyed. Higher concentrations of chlorine are also used to improve the microbiological suitability of bathing water (as in swimming pools). See also fluoridation.

chlorine n. an extremely pungent gaseous element with antiseptic and bleaching properties. It is widely used to sterilize drinking water and purify swimming pools. In high concentrations it is toxic; it was used in World War I as a poison gas in the trenches. Symbol: Cl.

chlormethiazole n. see clomethiazole.

chloroform n. a volatile liquid formerly widely used as a general anaesthetic. Because its use as such causes liver damage and affects heart rhythm, chloroform is now used only in low concentrations as a flavouring agent and preservative, in the treatment of flatulence, and in liniments as a *rubefacient.

chlorophenothane n. see DDT.

chlorophyll n. one of a group of green pigments, found in all green plants and some bacteria, that absorb light to provide energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water (photosynthesis). The two major chlorophylls, a and b, consist of a porphyrin/magnesium complex.

chloropsia n. green vision: a rare symptom of digitalis poisoning.

chloroquine n. a drug used principally in the treatment and prevention of benign *malarias but also occasionally in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. It may cause gastrointestinal disturbance, headache, and skin rashes or itching; a side-effect of prolonged use in large doses is eye damage. See also proguanil.

chlorphenamine (chlorpheniramine) n. a potent *antihistamine used to treat such allergies as hay fever and urticaria and in the emergency treatment of anaphylactic shock.

chlorpromazine n. a phenothiazine *antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia and mania; it is also used to control nausea and vomiting in terminal illness. Common side-effects are drowsiness and dry mouth. It also causes abnormalities of movement, especially *dystonias, *tardive dyskinesia, and *parkinsonism.

chlortalidone (chlorthalidone) n. a thiazide *diuretic used to treat fluid retention (oedema), *ascites due to cirrhosis, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, and diabetes insipidus. It may cause a fall in blood pressure on standing up, dizziness, and reduced blood potassium levels.

choana n. (pl. choanae) a funnel-shaped opening, particularly either of the two openings between the nasal cavity and the pharynx.

chokedamp n. see blackdamp.

chol- (chole-, cholo-) combining form denoting bile. Example: cholemesis (vomiting of).

cholagogue n. a drug that stimulates the flow of bile from the gall bladder and bile ducts into the duodenum.

cholangiocarcinoma n. a rare malignant tumour of the *bile ducts. Clinical features include abdominal pain, weight loss, pruritus, obstructive jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests. A tumour located at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts within the liver is known as a Klatskin tumour. Primary sclerosing *cholangitis, *ulcerative colitis, chronic infection with specific liver flukes (such as Clonorchis sinensis), and exposure to the imaging contrast agent Thorotrast are potential risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Differentiation from other causes of bile duct *stricture(s), e.g. sclerosing cholangitis, can be very difficult.

cholangiography n. imaging of the bile ducts in order to demonstrate congenital anatomical abnormalities (such as biliary atresia), biliary diseases, and the presence of gallstones or strictures. It may be combined with imaging of the pancreatic duct (cholangiopancreatography), as in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (see ERCP). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive *magnetic resonance imaging technique that has largely superseded ERCP for diagnostic purposes. ERCP following MRCP is used for therapeutic intervention. In operative (or on-table) cholangiography, a radiopaque *contrast medium is injected into the bile ducts during *cholecystectomy, to ensure that there are no remaining gallstones in the ducts. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is an invasive technique in which a catheter is manipulated under direct fluoroscopic guidance through the anterior abdominal wall, across the liver, and into a bile duct; contrast solution is injected to outline the bile ducts. Using a *Seldinger technique, drains or stents can be placed to treat infection or malignant strictures. T-tube cholangiography involves the postoperative injection of radiopaque contrast material via a drain (T-tube) left in the main bile duct after cholecystectomy.

cholangioma n. a benign tumour originating from the bile duct.

cholangiopancreatography n. see cholangiography.

cholangioscope n. a flexible optical endoscope using digital video technology to visualize and sample the interior of the bile ducts.

cholangitis n. inflammation and secondary bacterial infection of the bile ducts due to biliary obstruction and stasis. Obstruction may be caused by gallstones, benign or malignant *stricture, or intervention (such as ERCP). Symptoms include intermittent fever, usually with *rigors; abdominal pain; and intermittent jaundice (a combination known as Charcot’s triad). Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and decompression of the biliary tree to prevent recurrent infection. Liver abscesses may complicate cholangitis, and recurrent episodes of cholangitis can predispose to secondary biliary *cirrhosis. Sclerosing cholangitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the progressive occlusion of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts leading to stricture formation, liver cirrhosis, and subsequent liver failure. It is associated with *ulcerative colitis and autoimmune disease.

cholecalciferol n. see vitamin D.

cholecyst- combining form denoting the gall bladder. Example: cholecystotomy (incision of).

cholecystectomy n. surgical removal of the gall bladder, usually for *cholecystitis, gallstones, or biliary colic. Formerly performed by *laparotomy, the operation is now usually done by *laparoscopy (percutaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomy). See also minimally invasive surgery.

cholecystenterostomy n. a surgical procedure in which the gall bladder is joined to the small intestine. It is performed in order to allow bile to pass freely from the liver to the intestine, bypassing an obstructed common bile duct.

cholecystitis n. inflammation of the gall bladder. Acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of *gallstones obstructing the cystic duct (see bile duct) but in a minority of cases can occur in the absence of gallstones (acute acalculous cholecystitis). Initial treatment includes analgesia, intravenous fluid therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. *Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment. Chronic cholecystitis is an outdated term used for recurrent episodes of biliary colic; it should be avoided. See also cholesterosis; Murphy’s sign.

cholecystoduodenostomy n. a form of *cholecystenterostomy in which the gall bladder is surgically anastomosed to the duodenum.

cholecystography n. X-ray examination of the gall bladder. In oral cholecystography a radiopaque contrast agent is administered by mouth, absorbed by the intestine, and excreted into bile, which is then concentrated in the gall bladder. An X-ray image (cholecystogram) may now be taken. As a technique to demonstrate the presence of gallstones, this has been replaced by ultrasound scanning. However, cholecystography is still sometimes used to look for any leakage or obstruction to drainage after surgery; in this case, the contrast medium is administered directly by catheter.

cholecystokinin n. a hormone secreted by the cells of the duodenum in response to the presence of partly digested food in the duodenum. It causes contraction of the gall bladder and expulsion of bile into the intestine and stimulates the production of digestive enzymes by the pancreas (see also pancreatic juice). In the brain cholecystokinin functions as a neurotransmitter, involved in the control of satiety.

cholecystolithiasis the presence of gallstones specifically in the gall bladder (as opposed to the common bile duct: see choledocholithiasis).

cholecystostomy (cholecystotomy) n. an intervention in which a catheter is placed in an infected gall bladder to drain the pus. This is the preferred technique for patients who are unfit to undergo emergency removal of the gall bladder (*cholecystectomy).

choledoch- (choledocho-) combining form denoting the common bile duct. Example: choledochoplasty (plastic surgery of).

choledocholithiasis n. gallstones within the common bile duct. Gallstones usually form in the gall bladder and pass through the cystic duct into the common bile duct. However, they may develop within the common bile duct itself, despite *cholecystectomy.

choledochoscope n. a highly specialized endoscopic instrument used to visualize the common bile duct. This can aid removal of stones from the common bile duct during a laparoscopic *cholecystectomy.

choledochotomy n. a surgical operation in which the common bile duct is opened in order to search for or to remove stones within it. It may be performed at the same time as *cholecystectomy or if gallstones form in the bile duct after cholecystectomy.

cholelithiasis n. the presence of *gallstones in the gall bladder (*cholecystolithiasis) or the common bile duct (*choledocholithiasis).

cholelithotomy n. removal of gallstones by *cholecystostomy.

cholera n. an acute infection of the small intestine by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea (known as ricewater stools) leading to dehydration. The disease is contracted from food or drinking water contaminated by faeces from a patient. Cholera often occurs in epidemics; outbreaks are rare in good sanitary conditions. After an incubation period of 1–5 days symptoms commence suddenly; the resulting dehydration and the imbalance in the concentration of body fluids can cause death within 24 hours in severe cases if untreated. Initial treatment involves replacing the fluid loss by *oral rehydration therapy; tetracycline eradicates the bacteria and hastens recovery. The mortality rate in untreated cases is over 50%. Vaccination against cholera is effective for only 6–9 months.

choleresis n. the production of bile by the liver.

choleretic n. an agent that stimulates the secretion of bile by the liver thereby increasing the flow of bile.

cholestasis n. failure of normal amounts of bile to reach the intestine. This may be secondary to mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts, for example by gallstones or tumour (extrahepatic biliary obstruction), or to disturbances in bile formation (intrahepatic cholestasis). Many common drugs are associated with intrahepatic cholestasis, and it may occur in pregnancy (see obstetric cholestasis). The cardinal symptom of cholestasis is pruritus (itching); other symptoms include jaundice (more typical of extrahepatic cholestasis), dark urine, and pale stools.

cholesteatoma n. a skin-lined sac containing debris from dead skin cells that grows from the eardrum into the *mastoid bone, eroding normal structures in its path. Left untreated, it can carry infection to the brain, causing meningitis or a cerebral *abscess. Treatment is by means of *mastoidectomy. Rarely, cholesteatoma can arise congenitally in the *temporal bone or central nervous system.

cholesterol n. a fatlike material (a *sterol) present in the blood and most tissues, especially nervous tissue. Cholesterol and its esters are important constituents of cell membranes and are precursors of many steroid hormones and bile salts. Western dietary intake is approximately 500–1000 mg/day. Cholesterol is synthesized in the body from acetate, mainly in the liver, and blood concentration is normally 140–300 mg/100 ml (3.6–7.8 mmol/l). An elevated concentration of cholesterol in the blood (see hypercholesterolaemia) is often associated with *atheroma, of which cholesterol is a major component. Hypercholesterolaemia and the resulting atheroma have been linked with a high dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. However, current thinking suggests that the damage to blood vessels is caused by high levels (over 4.4 mmol/l) of *low-density lipoprotein (LDL), one of the forms in which cholesterol and other lipids are transported in the bloodstream. See also hyperlipidaemia; lipoprotein.

cholesterosis n. an uncommon form of chronic inflammation of the gall bladder in which small crystals of cholesterol are deposited on the internal wall, like the pips of a strawberry: hence its descriptive term strawberry gall bladder. The crystals may enlarge to become *gallstones.

cholestyramine n. see colestyramine.

cholic acid (cholalic acid) see bile acids.

choline n. a basic compound important in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and other *phospholipids and of *acetylcholine. It is also involved in the transport of fat in the body. Choline is sometimes classed as a vitamin but, although it is essential for life, it can be synthesized in the body.

cholinergic adj. 1. describing nerve fibres that release *acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. 2. describing *receptors at which acetylcholine acts to pass on messages from cholinergic nerve fibres. 3. describing drugs that mimic the actions of acetylcholine (see parasympathomimetic). Compare adrenergic.

cholinergic urticaria see urticaria.

cholinesterase n. an enzyme that breaks down a choline ester into its choline and acid components. The term usually refers to acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter *acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. It is found in all *cholinergic nerve junctions, where it rapidly destroys the acetylcholine released during the transmission of a nerve impulse so that subsequent impulses may pass. Other cholinesterases are found in the blood and other tissues.

choluria n. the presence of bile in the urine, which lends it a dark brown colour. Choluria is caused by liver disease, usually in cases of obstructive jaundice, and reflects an excess of bilirubin in the blood.

chondr- (chondro-) combining form denoting cartilage. Example: chondrogenesis (formation of).

chondrin n. a material that resembles gelatin, produced when cartilage is boiled.

chondriosome n. see mitochondrion.

chondroblast n. a cell that produces the matrix of *cartilage.

chondroblastoma n. a tumour derived from *chondroblasts, having the appearance of a mass of well-differentiated cartilage.

chondrocalcinosis n. the appearance of calcific material in joint cartilage, most commonly an incidental finding on X-ray of the knees in elderly patients and usually causing no symptoms. Calcification of cartilage may also be seen at the shoulder and in the fibrocartilage of the wrist. It may be associated with osteoarthritis. It is also seen less commonly in several other disorders, including Wilson’s disease, pseudogout, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, and haemochromatosis.

chondroclast n. a cell that is concerned with the absorption of cartilage.

chondrocranium n. the embryonic skull, which is composed entirely of cartilage and is later replaced by bone. See also meninx.

chondrocyte n. a *cartilage cell, found embedded in the matrix.

chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis a fairly common painful nodule on the upper part of the ear. It occurs mainly in middle-aged or elderly men and characteristically prevents the sufferer from sleeping on the affected side; it is readily treated by being cut out.

chondrodysplasia (chondro-osteodystrophy, chondrodystrophy) n. any of various conditions in which there is abnormal cartilage development. It affects long bones and can cause short-limb dwarfism, overgrowth of the epiphysis, or other deformities. One particular form is an autosomal *recessive syndrome most commonly found in Old Order Amish populations. See also achondroplasia.

chondroitin sulphate a mucopolysaccharide that forms an important constituent of cartilage, bone, and other connective tissues. It is composed of glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine units. Although it is sold as a supplement to help with joint pain, evidence of any benefit is limited.

chondroma n. a relatively common benign tumour of cartilage-forming cells, which may occur at the growing end of any bone but is found most commonly in the bones of the feet and hands. It may be a chance finding on X-ray, it may expand the bone, or it may be the site of a *pathological fracture.

chondromalacia n. softening, inflammation, and degeneration of cartilage at a joint. Chondromalacia patellae is the most common kind, affecting the undersurface of the kneecap; it results in pain in the front of the knee and grating (*crepitus), which is made worse by kneeling, squatting, and climbing stairs. Treatment includes physiotherapy, ice packs, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weight loss, and avoidance of aggravating factors, such as running and jumping.

chondroplasty n. the refashioning of articular cartilage, commonly performed by shaving areas of worn and unstable cartilage with the aid of an *arthroscope.

chondrosarcoma n. an uncommon malignant tumour of cartilage cells occurring in a bone, most frequently in the femur, humerus, ribs, or pelvis, and most commonly affecting adults in their fifties and sixties. It has a typical ‘snowstorm’ appearance on X-ray. Treatment is by surgical removal; these tumours are not usually sensitive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

chord- (chordo-) combining form denoting 1. a cord. 2. the notochord.

chorda n. (pl. chordae) a cord, tendon, or nerve fibre. The chordae tendineae are stringlike processes in the heart that attach the margins of the mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets to projections of the wall of the ventricle (papillary muscles). Rupture of the chordae, through injury, endocarditis, or degenerative changes, results in *mitral regurgitation.

chordee n. abnormal curvature or angulation of the penis. In *Peyronie’s disease, this is due to a localized fibrous plaque in the penis, which fails to engorge on erection. As a result, the penis angulates at this point making intercourse impossible. In a child, downward chordee is an associated deformity in *hypospadias and the more severe forms are corrected surgically.

chordoma n. a rare tumour arising from remnants of the embryologic *notochord. The classical sites are the base of skull and the region of the sacrum.

chorea n. a jerky involuntary movement particularly affecting the head, face, or limbs. Each movement is sudden but the resulting posture may be prolonged for a few seconds. The symptoms are usually due to disease of the *basal ganglia but may result from drug therapy for *parkinsonism or phenothiazines. Such movements are characteristic of *Huntington’s disease, in which they are associated with progressive dementia. See also Sydenham’s chorea.

chorioamnionitis n. inflammation and infection of the inner and outer fetal membranes, often after preterm premature rupture of membranes (*PPROM). This condition is associated with poor fetal outcome and can lead to maternal sepsis from *endometritis.

choriocarcinoma (chorionepithelioma) n. a rare malignant tumour of the placenta originating in the outer membrane (chorion) surrounding the fetus. Usually it is a complication of a *hydatidiform mole, although it may follow a miscarriage or even a normal pregnancy. The tumour rapidly spreads to the lungs, but is usually very sensitive to chemotherapy. It produces high levels of beta *human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which can be monitored as a tumour marker. See also gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

chorion n. the embryonic membrane that totally surrounds the embryo from the time of implantation. It is formed from *trophoblast lined with mesoderm and becomes closely associated with the *allantois. The blood vessels (supplied by the allantois) are concentrated in the region of the chorion that is attached to the wall of the uterus and forms the *placenta. See also villus. —chorionic adj.

chorionicity the number of chorionic membranes present on direct examination of the placenta and membranes following delivery of *twins. Chorionicity can be determined antenatally by ultrasound, ideally between 10 and 14 weeks gestation. Where two placental masses are identified, the pregnancy is dichorionic. More frequently a single placental mass exists and chorionicity can only be determined by evaluation of the intertwin membrane; the pregnancy is monochorionic when the fetuses share a chorion (see illustration; see also lambda sign; T-sign). Chorionicity rather than zygosity is a better determinant of perinatal outcome in twins. The perinatal mortality rate of monochorionic pregnancies may be up to four times that of dichorionic.

Chorionicity.





chorionic villus sampling (CVS) an invasive procedure for *prenatal diagnosis in which a sample of placental tissue (containing chorionic *villi) is aspirated through the cervix or abdomen under ultrasound visualization. It is usually performed between the 10th and 13th weeks of gestation. The cells so obtained are subjected to chromosomal analysis to determine if any abnormalities are present in the fetus. This enables the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down’s syndrome.

chorioretinopathy n. any eye disease involving both the choroid and the retina. See central serous chorioretinopathy.

choristoma n. a mass of tissue composed of tissue not normally found at the affected site. A *dermoid cyst is an example.

choroid n. the layer of the eyeball between the retina and the sclera (see also Bruch’s membrane). It contains blood vessels and a pigment that absorbs excess light and so prevents blurring of vision. See eye. —choroidal adj.

choroidal detachment the separation of the *choroid from the *sclera of the eye as a result of leakage of fluid from the vessels of the choroid. It occurs when pressure inside the eyeball is very low, usually after trauma or intraocular surgery.

choroideraemia n. a sex-linked hereditary condition in which the retinal pigment epithelium (see retina) and the choroid begin to degenerate in the first few months or years of life. In males this results in blindness, but in females it rarely causes any significant visual loss.

choroiditis n. inflammation of the choroid layer of the eye. It may be inflamed together with the iris and ciliary body (see uveitis) but often is involved alone and in patches (focal or multifocal choroiditis). Vision becomes blurred but the eye is usually pain-free.

choroid plexus a rich network of blood vessels, derived from those of the pia mater, in each of the brain’s ventricles. It is responsible for the production of *cerebrospinal fluid.

CHP see Consultant in Health Protection.

Christmas disease (haemophilia B) a disorder that is identical in its effects to *haemophilia A, but is due to a deficiency of a different blood coagulation factor, the Christmas factor (Factor IX). [S. Christmas (20th century), in whom the factor was first identified]

chrom- (chromo-) combining form denoting colour or pigment.

chromaffin n. tissue in the medulla of the *adrenal gland consisting of modified neural cells containing granules that are stained brown by chromates. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are released from the granules when the adrenal gland is stimulated by its sympathetic nerve supply. See also neurohormone.

-chromasia combining form denoting staining or pigmentation.

chromat- (chromato-) combining form denoting colour or pigmentation.

chromatid n. one of the two threadlike strands formed by longitudinal division of a chromosome during *mitosis and *meiosis. They remain attached at the *centromere. Chromatids can be seen between early prophase and metaphase in mitosis and between diplotene and the second metaphase of meiosis, after which they divide at the centromere to form daughter chromosomes.

chromatin n. the material of a cell nucleus that stains with basic dyes and consists of DNA and protein: the substance of which the chromosomes are made. See euchromatin; heterochromatin.

chromatography n. any of several techniques for separating the components of a mixture by selective absorption. Two such techniques are quite widely used in medicine, for example to separate mixtures of amino acids. In one of these, paper chromatography, a sample of the mixture is placed at the edge of a sheet of filter paper. As the solvent soaks along the paper, the components are absorbed to different extents and thus move along the paper at different rates. In column chromatography the components separate out along a column of a powdered absorbent, such as silica or aluminium oxide.

chromatolysis n. the dispersal or disintegration of the microscopic structures within the nerve cells that normally produce proteins. It is part of the cell’s response to injury.

chromatophore n. a cell containing pigment. In humans chromatophores containing *melanin are found in the skin, hair, and eyes.

chromatopsia n. abnormal coloured vision: a rare symptom of various conditions. Sometimes everything looks reddish to patients after removal of their cataracts; patients suffering from digitalis poisoning may see things in green or yellow. Similar disturbances of colour may be experienced by people recovering from inflammation of the optic nerve.

chromium n. a *trace element, thought to be part of the complex that maintains blood sugar levels and controls insulin. Deficiency has been observed in patients on long-term *total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Symbol: Cr.

chromoblastomycosis (chromomycosis) n. a chronic fungal infection of the skin usually occurring at the site of an injury; for example, a wound from a wood splinter. It produces pigmented wartlike lumps on exposed areas that sometimes ulcerate. In the immunocompromised it may spread rapidly and even prove fatal.

chromogen n. any agent in certain foods and drinks, such as red wine, coffee, and berries, that stains the enamel of teeth. Chromogenic bacteria may also produce hydrogen sulphide that reacts with oral saliva to result in coloured staining (normally black).

chromophobe (chromophobic) adj. describing cells or tissues that do not stain well with either acidic or basic dyes. Chromophobic cells may be seen, for example, in the anterior pituitary gland. See also adenoma.

chromosome n. one of the threadlike structures in a cell nucleus that carry the genetic information in the form of *genes. It is composed of a long double filament of *DNA coiled into a helix together with associated proteins, with the genes arranged in a linear manner along its length. It stains deeply with basic dyes during cell division (see meiosis; mitosis). The nucleus of each human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 of which are of maternal and 23 of paternal origin (see illustration). Each chromosome can duplicate an exact copy of itself between each cell division (see interphase) so that each new cell formed receives a full set of chromosomes. See also chromatid; centromere; sex chromosome. —chromosomal adj.

Chromosome. Human male chromosomes, arranged in numbered pairs according to a standard classification. The female set differs only in the sex chromosomes (XX instead of XY).





chron- (chrono-) combining form denoting time. Example: chronophobia (abnormal fear of).

chronic adj. 1. describing a disease of long duration involving very slow changes. Such a disease is often of gradual onset. The term does not imply anything about the severity of a disease. Compare acute. 2. describing a type of inflammation characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. —chronicity n.

chronic fatigue syndrome see CFS/ME/PVF.

chronic idiopathic facial pain see persistent idiopathic facial pain.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, chronic obstructive airways disease) a disease of adults, especially those over the age of 45 with a history of smoking or inhalation of airborne pollution, characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible. The disease has features of *emphysema, chronic *bronchitis, and asthmatic bronchitis. It is now diagnosed, according to the *GOLD guidelines, at different stages:

Stage 0: the presence of risk factors and symptoms (e.g. cough and wheeze) with normal *forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

Stage 1: FEV1 is normal, but the ratio of FEV1 to forced *vital capacity (FVC) is less than 70%.

Stage 2: FEV1 is less than 80% but more than 50% of the predicted value for the patient’s age and height.

Stage 3: FEV1 less than 50% but more than 30%.

Stage 4: FEV1 less than 30% or the presence of chronic respiratory failure.





The guidelines for COPD recommend different treatment regimens for different stages. Although the response to inhaled corticosteriods is less for COPD than for asthma, these drugs, especially combined with inhaled long-acting beta agonists (e.g. *salmeterol), can improve quality of life and survival in stages 3 and 4. There is also a decrease in the number of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): increased sputum volume or purulence and/or breathlessness, with or without symptoms (e.g. cough, wheeze, chest pain, malaise, fever).

chronic pelvic pain (CPP) intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months’ duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy. It may be caused by an underlying gynaecological condition, such as *endometriosis or adhesions, but bowel or bladder disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis), visceral hypersensitivity, and psychological conditions may all contribute.

Chronic Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (in Britain) an Act providing for the identification and care of those suffering from a chronic or degenerative disease for which there is no cure and which can be only partially alleviated by treatment. Such people are usually distinguished from the elderly who may also suffer from chronic diseases. It is the responsibility of local authorities to identify those with such problems and to ensure that services are available to meet their needs. Identification can be difficult because of the lack of a clear and agreed definition of what constitutes a disability of such severity as to warrant inclusion in such a register.

chronic total occlusion (CTO) a complete arterial blockage (usually coronary) that has been present for at least three months. Fibrosis and calcification at the site of occlusion are well established by this time, making *percutaneous coronary intervention to open the artery much more difficult.

chrys- (chryso-) combining form denoting gold or gold salts.

chrysiasis n. the deposition of gold in the eye and other tissues as a result of prolonged or excessive treatment with gold salts.

Chrysops n. a genus of bloodsucking flies, commonly called deer flies. Female flies, found in shady wooded areas, bite humans during the day. Certain species in Africa may transmit the tropical disease *loiasis to humans. In the USA C. discalis is a vector of *tularaemia.

chrysotherapy n. the treatment of disease by the administration of *gold or its compounds.

Churg–Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) a systemic autoimmune *vasculitis comprising severe asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis associated with an increased *eosinophil count in the peripheral blood and eosinophilic deposits in the small vessels of the lungs. It usually responds to oral corticosteroids. [J. Churg (1910–2005) and L. Strauss (1913–85), US pathologists]

chyle n. an alkaline milky liquid found within the *lacteals after a period of absorption. It consists of lymph with a suspension of minute droplets of digested fats (triglycerides), which have been absorbed from the small intestine. It is transported in the lymphatic system to the *thoracic duct. See also ascites.

chylomicron n. a *lipoprotein particle present in the blood after digested fat has been absorbed from the small intestine. The lipid portion consists largely of triglycerides, which are released by the action of *lipoprotein lipase.

chyluria n. the presence of *chyle in the urine.

chyme n. the semiliquid acid mass that is the form in which food passes from the stomach to the small intestine. It is produced by the action of *gastric juice and the churning movements of the stomach.

chymotrypsin n. a protein-digesting enzyme (see peptidase). It is secreted by the pancreas in an inactive form, chymotrypsinogen, that is converted into chymotrypsin in the duodenum by the action of *trypsin.

chymotrypsinogen n. see chymotrypsin.

Cialis n. see sildenafil.

cicatricial adj. associated with scarring. For example, cicatricial alopecia is a type of baldness associated with scarring (see alopecia).

ciclosporin (cyclosporin) n. an *immunosuppressant drug used to prevent and treat rejection of a transplanted organ or bone marrow. It may also be used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atopic eczema, and ulcerative colitis. Side-effects include nausea, gum swelling, tremor, excessive hair growth, and kidney impairment.

-cide combining form denoting killer or killing. Examples: bactericide (of bacteria); infanticide (of children).

ciliary body the part of the *eye that connects the choroid with the iris. It consists of three zones: the ciliary ring, which adjoins the choroid; the ciliary processes, a series of about 70 radial ridges behind the iris to which the suspensory ligament of the lens is attached; and the ciliary muscle, contraction of which alters the curvature of the lens (see accommodation).

cilium n. (pl. cilia) 1. a hairlike process, large numbers of which are found on certain epithelial cells and on certain (ciliate) protozoa. Cilia are particularly characteristic of the epithelium that lines the upper respiratory tract, where their beating serves to remove particles of dust and other foreign material. 2. an eyelash or eyelid. —ciliary adj.

Blood-vessel (atraumatic) clamps are used to stop bleeding from the cut vessels and are designed not to damage the arterial wall. Intestinal clamps prevent the intestinal contents from leaking into the abdominal cavity during operations on the intestines and are designed either not to damage the intestinal wall (noncrushing clamps) or to close the open end (crushing clamps) prior to excising and suturing the intestine to create an anastomosis.

Intestinal clamps.





Clark’s levels the five vertical levels of skin that are successively penetrated by an invading *melanoma. They are: epidermis, papillary dermis, intervening zone, reticular dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. They usually correlate with the *Breslow thickness. [W. H. Clark (1924–97), US dermatologist]

clasp-knife rigidity see spasticity.

claudication n. limping. Intermittent claudication is a cramping pain, induced by exercise and relieved by rest, that is caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the affected muscles. It is most often seen in the calf and leg muscles as a result of *atheroma of the leg arteries. The leg pulses are often absent and the feet may be cold. The treatment is that of atheroma.

claw-foot n. an excessively arched foot, giving an unnaturally high instep. In most cases the cause is unknown, but the deformity may sometimes be due to an imbalance between the muscles flexing the toes and the shorter muscles that extend them; this type is found in some neuromuscular diseases, such as Friedreich’s *ataxia. Surgical treatment is effective in childhood but less so in adult life. Medical name: pes cavus.

claw-hand n. flexion and contraction of the fingers with extension at the joints between the fingers and the hand, giving a claw-like appearance. Any kind of damage to the nerves or muscles may lead to claw-hand; causes include injuries, *syringomyelia, and leprosy. See also Dupuytren’s contracture.

clearance (renal clearance) n. a quantitative measure of the rate at which waste products are removed from the blood by the kidneys or through the process of dialysis. It is expressed in terms of the volume of blood that could be completely cleared of a particular substance in a particular unit of time. Clearance by the kidney is usually measured as ml/min while clearance with, say, peritoneal dialysis is usually measured in litres/week.

clear-cell carcinoma (clear-cell adenocarcinoma) a variant of *adenocarcinoma that tends to arise from the kidneys or the female genital tract. In the latter case it is linked to intrauterine exposure to *diethylstilbestrol during the 1950s and 1960s and takes the form of a vaginal cancer, which can be treated by radical surgery followed by radiotherapy.

Xylene, cedar oil, methyl benzoate plus benzol, and methyl salicylate plus benzol are commonly used as clearing agents.

cleavage n. (in embryology) the process of repeated cell division of the fertilized egg to form a ball of cells that becomes the *blastocyst. The cells (blastomeres) do not grow between divisions and so they decrease in size.

cleft lip (harelip) the congenital deformity of a cleft in the upper lip, on one or both sides of the midline. It occurs when the three blocks of embryonic tissue that go to form the upper lip fail to fuse and it is often associated with a *cleft palate. Medical name: cheiloschisis.

cleft palate a fissure in the midline of the palate due to failure of the two sides to fuse in embryonic development. Only part of the palate may be affected, or the cleft may extend the full length with bilateral clefts at the front of the maxilla; it may be accompanied by a *cleft lip and disturbance of tooth formation. Cleft palates can be corrected by surgery.

cleid- (cleido-, clid-, clido-) combining form denoting the clavicle (collar bone). Example: cleidocranial (of the clavicle and cranium).

client-centred therapy (Rogerian therapy) a method of psychotherapy in which the therapist refrains from directing clients in what they should do and instead concentrates on communicating understanding and acceptance. Frequently the therapist reflects the clients’ own words or feelings back to them. The aim is to enable clients to solve their own problems.

climacteric n. 1. see menopause. 2. (male climacteric) declining sexual drive and fertility in men, usually occurring around or after middle age. See andropause.

clindamycin n. an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections, such as staphylococcal bone and joint infections. The most serious side-effect is pseudomembranous colitis, caused by overgrowth of *Clostridium difficile, which limits the use of this drug; other side-effects include nausea, vomiting, and occasional hypersensitivity reactions.

clinic n. 1. an establishment or department of a hospital devoted to the treatment of particular diseases or the medical care of out-patients. 2. a gathering of instructors, students, and patients, usually in a hospital ward, for the examination and treatment of the patients.

clinical audit a quality-improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review. Aspects of the structure, processes, and outcomes of care are selected and systematically evaluated against explicit criteria. Where indicated, changes are implemented at an individual, team, or service level and further monitoring is used to confirm improvement in health-care delivery. The assessment, evaluation, and improvement of quality then forms a cycle of activity (audit cycle) that promotes sustained improvement (see diagram).

Clinical audit. The audit cycle.





A distinction may be made between clinical audit, which refers to total care (involving doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, etc.), and medical audit, which refers to medical care specifically performed by doctors, although in practice the two terms are often used interchangeably.

clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) self-governing bodies set up by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, following the abolition of *primary care trusts and *strategic health authorities, to commission most NHS services in England. CCGs are formed of all GP practices within a given geographical area, and all GP practices must belong to a clinical commissioning group. All CCGs have their own constitution and governing body, which (in addition to GPs) must include at least one registered nurse and at least one secondary care specialist doctor. There are currently 195 CCGs in England.

clinical ethics consideration of the moral issues attendant upon, and questions arising from, clinical practice, as distinct from research. In North America, it is common for hospitals to employ a clinical ethicist or provide a formal clinical ethics consultation service. In the UK, clinical *ethics committees are increasingly common in the NHS.

Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scales commonly used by clinicians to measure symptom severity and treatment response in treatment studies of patients with psychiatric illnesses. Many researchers consider them to be a good tool to measure the clinical utility or relevance of a given treatment. The Clinical Global Impression–Severity scale (CGI-S) is used to rate the severity of the patient’s symptoms relative to the clinician’s past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Scores range from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill). The Clinical Global Impression–Improvement scale (CGI-I) measures change in the patient’s presentation from baseline. Scores range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). A score of 4 indicates no change.

clinical governance the framework through which the NHS aims to deliver high-quality services within a safe system, with continuous efforts for service improvement. Introduced in 1998, clinical governance emphasizes the concept of accountability: organizations, teams, and individuals should understand and accept their roles and responsibilities in delivering care. The range of activities undertaken under the banner of clinical governance includes ensuring clinical effectiveness of treatments, *risk management, *clinical audit, *quality assurance, patient and public involvement (in local *Healthwatch groups), staff education, development, and training (see appraisal; revalidation), and research. There is a push in the NHS towards integrated governance: a cohesive approach to all governance arrangements (clinical, corporate, and financial) in organizations, with an emphasis on involving patients and external stakeholders in the development of future arrangements. See also Care Quality Commission; integrated care pathway; NICE; national service frameworks.

clinical medical officer see community health.

clinical medicine the branch of medicine dealing with the study of actual patients and the diagnosis and treatment of disease at the bedside, as opposed to the study of disease by *pathology or other laboratory work.

clinical trial see intervention study.

clinodactyly n. congenital deflection of one or more digits from the central axis of the hand or foot. Clinodactyly may affect both hands (or feet) but most commonly affects the fifth finger (which curves towards the fourth). It has an incidence of 9% and may be found in isolation, in association with other congenital malformations, or it may occur as part of a syndrome (e.g. Down’s syndrome). No treatment is necessary.

clitoridectomy n. the surgical removal of the clitoris (see female genital mutilation).

clone 1. n. a group of cells (usually bacteria) descended from a single cell by asexual reproduction and therefore genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. 2. n. an organism derived from a single cell of its parent and therefore genetically identical to it. The first cloned animal, born in 1997, was produced by fusing a somatic nucleus of the parent with a denucleated egg cell of a second animal. The resulting ‘embryo’ was implanted into the uterus of a third animal to complete its development. 3. n. (gene clone) a group of identical genes produced by *genetic engineering. The parent gene is isolated using *restriction enzymes and inserted, via a cloning vector (e.g. a bacteriophage), into a bacterium, in which it is replicated. See also vector. 4. vb. to form a clone. See also cloning.

clonic adj. of, relating to, or resembling clonus. The term is most commonly used to describe the rhythmical limb movements seen as part of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (see epilepsy).

It is occasionally used to treat high blood pressure Common side-effects include drowsiness and dry mouth, and sudden withdrawal may worsen the hypertension.

In the clonidine suppression test, used in the diagnosis of *phaeochromocytoma, clonidine is administered orally and plasma catecholamines sampled then and at hourly intervals for three hours. In normal subjects clonidine suppresses release of catecholamines and plasma levels are reduced, but in people with phaeochromocytoma plasma catecholamines remain elevated.

cloning n. the process of making identical copies (*clones) of genes, cells, or organisms. Therapeutic cloning, which is lawful if licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, produces human blastocysts to harvest their *stem cells. In reproductive cloning, whole animals are produced: see clone (sense 2); reproductive cloning of humans is unlawful in the UK. The moral issues relative to therapeutic and reproductive cloning are hotly debated, although for many it is the purpose of cloning that determines its moral acceptability or otherwise.

clonogenic adj. describing a cell capable of producing a colony of cells of a predetermined minimum size. Such a cell is known as a colony forming unit (CFU).

clonorchiasis n. a condition caused by the presence of the fluke Clonorchis sinensis in the bile ducts. The infection, common in the Far East, is acquired through eating undercooked, salted, or pickled freshwater fish harbouring the larval stage of the parasite. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, liver enlargement, loss of appetite, emaciation and – in advanced cases – cirrhosis and jaundice. Treatment is unsatisfactory although *praziquantel has proved beneficial in some cases.

Clonorchis n. a genus of liver flukes, common parasites of humans and other fish-eating mammals in the Far East. The adults of C. sinensis cause clonorchiasis. Eggs are passed out in the stools and the larvae undergo their development in two other hosts, a snail and a fish.

clonus n. rhythmical contraction of a muscle in response to a suddenly applied and then sustained stretch stimulus. It is most readily obtained at the ankle when the examiner bends the foot sharply upwards and then maintains an upward pressure on the sole. It is caused by an exaggeration of the stretch reflexes and is usually a sign of disease in the brain or spinal cord.

clopidogrel n. an *antiplatelet drug given to prevent strokes or heart attacks in those at risk. Side-effects may include gastrointestinal bleeding.

Clostridium n. a genus of mostly Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming rodlike bacteria commonly found in soil and in the intestinal tract of humans and animals. Many species cause disease and produce extremely potent *exotoxins. C. botulinum grows freely in badly preserved canned foods, producing a toxin causing serious food poisoning (*botulism); an extremely dilute form of this toxin is now used to treat muscle spasm (see botulinum toxin). C. histolyticum, C. oedematiens, and C. septicum all cause *gas gangrene when they infect wounds. C. tetani lives as a harmless *commensal in the intestine but causes *tetanus on contamination of wounds (with manured soil). The species C. perfringens – Welch’s bacillus – causes blood poisoning, *food poisoning, and gas gangrene. Overgrowth of Clostridium difficile (often shortened to C. diff), a normal inhabitant of the human large intestine, is not uncommon as a complication of some antibiotic therapy and produces a specific condition – pseudomembranous colitis (see pseudomembrane) – which is life-threatening unless treated promptly and is becoming more common as a hospital-acquired infection.

clotrimazole n. an antifungal drug used to treat all types of fungal skin infections (including ringworm), infection in otitis externa, and vaginal candidiasis (thrush). It is applied to the infected part and occasionally causes mild burning or irritation.

CLS see Coffin–Lowry syndrome.

clubbing n. thickening of the tissues at the bases of the finger and toe nails so that the normal angle between the nail and the digit is filled in. The nail becomes convex in all directions and in extreme cases the digit end becomes bulbous like a club or drumstick. Clubbing is seen in pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, empyema, infective endocarditis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, lung cancer, and cirrhosis and as a harmless congenital abnormality.

club-foot (talipes) n. a congenital deformity of one or both feet in which the patient cannot stand with the sole of the foot flat on the ground. In the most common variety (congenital talipes equinovarus) the foot points downwards, the heel is inverted, and the forefoot twisted. It is diagnosed at birth and may be associated with other congenital abnormalities. Treatment is initially by physiotherapy and strapping or a plaster cast, but if this fails to correct the deformity surgical correction is performed. Other varieties are talipes varus, inward deviation of the hind foot; and talipes valgus, an outward deviation of the hind foot, which is much less common.

clumping n. see agglutination.

cluster headache a variant of *migraine more common in men than in women (ratio 9:1). The unilateral pain around one eye is very severe and lasts between 15 minutes and 3 hours. The attacks commonly occur in the early hours of the morning but may occur up to eight times a day. The pain is associated with drooping of the eyelid (*ptosis), a bloodshot eye, a small pupil, and/or excessive production of tears in the eye. The acute treatment is with high-flow inhaled oxygen in conjunction with antimigraine drugs (5HT1 agonists) and prophylaxis is with such drugs as verapamil, lithium, or methysergide.

coagulation factors (clotting factors) a group of substances present in blood plasma that, under certain circumstances, undergo a series of chemical reactions leading to the conversion of blood from a liquid to a solid state (see blood coagulation). Although they have specific names, most coagulation factors are referred to by an agreed set of Roman numerals (e.g. *Factor VIII, *Factor IX). Lack of any of these factors in the blood results in the inability of the blood to clot. See also haemophilia.

coagulation time (clotting time) the time taken for blood or blood plasma to coagulate (see blood coagulation). When measured under controlled conditions and using appropriate techniques, coagulation times may be used to test the function of the various stages of the blood coagulation process.

coalesce vb. to grow together or unite. —coalescence n.

coal tar a complex mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from the distillation of coal. It has anti-inflammatory and antiscaling activity and is used in the treatment of psoriasis, eczema, and dandruff. Side-effects may include local irritation and photosensitivity.

coal-worker’s pneumoconiosis a lung disease caused by coal dust. It affects mainly coal miners but also other exposed workers, such as lightermen, if the lungs’ capacity to accommodate and remove the particles is exceeded. See pneumoconiosis.

co-amoxiclav see beta-lactam antibiotic.

coarctation n. (of the aorta) a congenital narrowing of a short segment of the aorta. The most common site of coarctation is just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery from the aorta. This results in high blood pressure (*hypertension) in the upper part of the body and arms and low blood pressure in the legs. The defect is corrected by surgery or *stent implantation.

Coats’ disease a congenital anomaly of the blood vessels of the retina, which are abnormally dilated and leaking. This results in subretinal haemorrhage and exudative *retinal detachment. [G. Coats (1876–1915), British ophthalmologist]

coblation n. a technique that uses high-frequency electric current passed through saline to generate relatively low levels of heat that can simultaneously cut through tissue and coagulate bleeding vessels by means of a device called a coblator. The technique can be used for several operations, most notably *tonsillectomy.

cocaine n. an alkaloid that is derived from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxylon coca) or prepared synthetically and was formerly used as a local anaesthetic in ear, nose, and throat surgery. Since it causes feelings of exhilaration and may lead to psychological *dependence, cocaine has been replaced by safer anaesthetics.

coccidioidomycosis n. an infection caused by inhaling the spores of the fungus Coccidioides immitis. In 60% of patients infection produces no symptoms at all. In the primary form there is an influenza-like illness that usually resolves within about eight weeks. In a few patients the disease becomes progressive and resembles tuberculosis. Severe or progressive infections are treated with intravenous injections of amphotericin. The disease is endemic in the desert areas of the Americas, especially the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and northern Argentina.

coccobacillus n. a rod-shaped bacterium (bacillus) that is so small that it resembles a spherical bacterium (coccus). Examples of such bacteria are *Bacteroides and *Brucella.

cochlea n. the spiral organ of the *labyrinth of the ear, which is concerned with the reception and analysis of sound. As vibrations pass from the middle ear through the cochlea, different frequencies cause particular regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate: high notes cause vibration in the region nearest the middle ear; low notes cause vibration in the region nearest the tip of the spiral. The organ of Corti, which lies within a central triangular membrane-bound canal (scala media or cochlear duct), contains sensory hair cells attached to an overlying tectorial membrane (see illustration). When the basilar membrane vibrates the sensory cells become distorted and send nerve impulses to the brain via the *cochlear nerve. —cochlear adj.

Cochlea. Section through a turn of the cochlea.





cochlear duct (scala media) see cochlea.

cochlear implant a device to improve the hearing of profoundly deaf people who derive no benefit from conventional *hearing aids. It consists of an electrode that is permanently implanted into the inner ear (*cochlea). An external device with a microphone and an electronic processing unit passes information to the electrode using radio-frequency waves. The implant is powered by batteries in the external part of the device.

Common side-effects include constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness, but *dependence is uncommon. Codeine may also be administered orally in combination with paracetamol (as co-codamol) or aspirin (as co-codaprin) for pain relief.

Codman’s triangle a triangular area of new bone seen on X-ray at the edge of a malignant bone tumour resulting from elevation of the *periosteum by malignant tissue. It is most often seen in *osteosarcomas. [E. A. Codman (1869–1940), US surgeon]

codon n. the unit of the *genetic code that determines the synthesis of one particular amino acid. Each codon consists of a section of the DNA molecule, and the order of the codons along the molecule determines the order of amino acids in each protein made in the cell.

co-dydramol n. see dihydrocodeine.

-coele combining form denoting 1. a body cavity. Example: blastocoele (cavity of blastocyst). 2. see -cele.

coeli- (coelio-) combining form denoting the abdomen or belly. Example: coeliectasia (abnormal distension of).

coeliac adj. of or relating to the abdominal region. The coeliac axis (or trunk) is a branch of the abdominal *aorta supplying the stomach, spleen, liver, and gall bladder.

coeliac disease a condition in which the small intestine fails to digest and absorb food. Affecting 1–2% of the population worldwide, it is due to a permanent sensitivity of the intestinal lining to the protein gliadin, which is contained in *gluten in the germ of wheat and rye and causes atrophy of the digestive and absorptive cells of the intestine. Symptoms include stunted growth, distended abdomen, and pale frothy foul-smelling stools; the disease can be diagnosed by *biopsy of the jejunum and is treated successfully by a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet. Medical name: gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

coelom n. the cavity in an embryo between the two layers of mesoderm. It develops into the body cavity.

coenzyme n. a nonprotein organic compound that, in the presence of an *enzyme, plays an essential role in the reaction that is catalysed by the enzyme. Coenzymes, which frequently contain the B vitamins in their molecular structure, include *coenzyme A, *FAD, and *NAD.

coenzyme A a *nucleotide containing pantothenic acid, which is an important coenzyme in the Krebs cycle and in the metabolism of fatty acids.

cofactor n. a nonprotein substance that must be present in suitable amounts before certain *enzymes can act. Cofactors include *coenzymes and metal ions (e.g. sodium and potassium ions).

coffee-ground vomit vomit that has the appearance of ground coffee. It is composed of denatured oxidized blood and reflects bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Coffin–Lowry syndrome (CLS) an inherited disease, more severe in males, that results in developmental delay and profound learning disability. It is characterized by distinctive facial anomalies, short stature, microcephaly, and *kyphoscoliosis; some patients have episodes of collapse when startled or excited (stimulus-induced drop episodes; SIDE). [G. S. Coffin (1923– ), US paediatrician; R. B. Lowry (1932– ), British geneticist]

Cogan’s syndrome a disorder in which *keratitis and iridocyclitis (see uveitis) are associated with tinnitus, vertigo, and bilateral sensorineural deafness. [D. G. Cogan (1908–93), US ophthalmologist]

cognition n. the mental processes by which knowledge is acquired. These include perception, reasoning, acts of creativity, problem-solving, and possibly intuition. —cognitive adj.

cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) a *cognitive therapy that is combined with behavioural elements (see behaviour therapy). The patient is encouraged to analyse his or her specific ways of thinking around a problem. The therapist then looks at the resulting behaviour and the consequences of that thinking and tries to encourage the patient to change his or her cognition in order to avoid adverse behaviour or its consequences. CBT is successfully used to treat phobias, anxiety, and depression (it is among the recommended treatments for anxiety and depression in the NICE guidelines).

cognitive psychology the branch of psychology concerned with all human activities relating to knowledge. More specifically, cognitive psychology is concerned with how knowledge is acquired, stored, correlated, and retrieved, by studying the mental processes underlying attention, concept formation, information processing, memory, and speech. Cognitive psychology views the brain as an information-processing system operating on, and storing, the data acquired by the senses. It investigates this function by experiments designed to measure and analyse human performance in carrying out a wide range of mental tasks. The data obtained allows possible models of the underlying mental processes to be constructed. These models do not purport to represent the actual physiological activity of the brain. Nevertheless, as they are refined by testing and criticism, it is hoped that they may approach close to reality and gradually lead to a clearer understanding of how the brain operates.

cognitive therapy a form of *psychotherapy based on the belief that psychological problems are the products of faulty ways of thinking about the world. For example, a depressed patient may use wrongly negative automatic associations in everyday situations. The therapist assists the patient to identify these false ways of thinking and to avoid them. In *cognitive behavioural therapy this is combined with an analysis and retraining of unhelpful behaviours. In cognitive analytical therapy (CAT) there is an element of psychodynamic exploration of the patient’s problems; CAT is mostly used to treat personality disorders.

cohort study a *longitudinal study of a group of people defined by some common characteristic (typically age). It may be conducted prospectively or retrospectively. A prospective cohort study involves a systematic follow-up for a defined period of time or until the occurrence of a specified event (e.g. onset of illness, retirement, or death) in order to observe patterns of disease and/or cause of death. A retrospective cohort study examines data relating to the group’s history of exposure and disease experience.

coiling n. (in interventional radiology) a technique in which metallic coils are placed inside a blood vessel to occlude it or divert the blood away from an *aneurysm. In the case of acute bleeding, blocking the blood with coils is life-saving. In brain aneurysms, the bulging portion of the blood vessel is weak and can rupture, causing bleeding into the brain. By coiling the aneurysm the blood is diverted away from the weak portion. This has largely replaced aneurysm clipping by neurosurgeons, which involves opening the skull to gain access to the aneurysm.

coinsurance n. a form of private medical insurance policy in which the patient or other beneficiary shares the costs of treatment for injury or disease with the insurance company. Coinsurance policies are very common in the USA.

coitus (sexual intercourse, copulation) n. sexual contact between a man and a woman during which the erect penis enters the vagina and is moved within it by pelvic thrusts until *ejaculation occurs. See also orgasm. —coital adj.

coitus interruptus a contraceptive method in which the penis is removed from the vagina before ejaculation of semen (orgasm). The method is unreliable (10–20 pregnancies per 100 woman-years) and it may lead to sexual disharmony and anxiety in one or both partners.

col- (coli-, colo-) combining form denoting the colon. Example: coloptosis (prolapse of).

colchicine n. a drug obtained from the meadow saffron (Colchicum autumnale), used to relieve pain in attacks of gout and in the prevention of attacks of gout and hereditary *polyserositis. Common side-effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach pains.

cold (common cold) n. a widespread infectious virus disease causing inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, and bronchial tubes. The disease is transmitted by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms commence 1–2 days after infection and include a sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, headache, cough, and general malaise. The disease is mild and lasts only about a week but it can prove serious to young babies and to patients with a pre-existing respiratory complaint.

cold coagulation see cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

cold sore see herpes.

colectomy n. surgical removal of the colon. Total colectomy is removal of the whole colon, usually for extensive *colitis; partial colectomy is removal of a segment of the colon. See also hemicolectomy; proctocolectomy.

colestipol n. a *bile-acid sequestrant used, in conjunction with dietary reduction of cholesterol, to lower cholesterol levels in the blood in patients with hyperlipidaemia and primary hypercholesterolaemia that have not responded to diet. Constipation is a common side-effect.

colestyramine (cholestyramine) n. a drug that binds with bile salts so that they are excreted (see bile-acid sequestrant). It is used to relieve conditions due to irritant effects of bile salts (such as the itching that occurs in obstructive jaundice), to treat diarrhoea, and to lower the blood levels of cholesterol and other fats in patients with hyperlipidaemia. Common side-effects include constipation, heartburn, and nausea.

colic n. paroxysms of abdominal pain, usually of fluctuating severity. Infantile colic is common among babies, due to wind in the intestine associated with feeding difficulties. Intestinal colic is due to partial or complete obstruction of the intestine or to constipation. Medical name: enteralgia. Renal colic is excruciating pain caused by dilatation and spasm of the ureter when stones are present in the kidney, renal pelvis, or ureter. See also biliary colic.

coliform bacteria a group of Gram-negative rodlike bacteria that are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to ferment the sugar lactose. The group includes the genera Enterobacter, *Escherichia, and *Klebsiella.

colistimethate sodium (colistin) an antibiotic given to treat Gram-negative infections resistant to other antimicrobials and by inhalation to treat pseudomonal infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Colistin is a mixture of antimicrobial substances produced by a strain of the bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. Its most serious side-effects are nerve and kidney damage.

colitis n. inflammation of the colon due to infection, inflammation, or ischaemia. It is diagnosed by clinical assessment combined with radiological imaging, stool cultures, and endoscopic evaluation. Infectious colitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, or protozoans (for example, *Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic colitis: see dysentery). Inflammatory colitis encompasses *Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s colitis), *ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis. Microscopic colitis can only be seen under a microscope (at endoscopy the colon appears normal). Symptoms of inflammatory colitis may include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and the passage of blood and mucus in the stools. Ischaemic colitis occurs when there is partial or complete cessation of the blood supply to a particular region of the colon.

collagen n. a protein that is the principal constituent of white fibrous connective tissue (as occurs in tendons). Collagen is also found in skin, bone, cartilage, and ligaments. It is relatively inelastic but has a high tensile strength.

collagen disease an obsolete term for *connective-tissue disease.

collapsing pulse see Corrigan’s pulse.

collar bone see clavicle.

collateral 1. adj. accessory or secondary. 2. n. a branch (e.g. of a nerve fibre) that is at right angles to the main part.

collateral circulation 1. an alternative route provided for the blood by secondary vessels when a primary vessel becomes blocked. 2. the channels of communication between the blood vessels supplying the heart. At the apex of the heart, where the coronary arteries form *anastomoses, these are very complex.

collective unconscious (in Jungian psychology) structures of the unconscious mind shared by all humans. Jung considered the collective unconscious to exist collectively amongst humans in addition to the personal unconscious mind postulated by Freud. He argued that the collective unconscious, populated by instincts and *archetypes, had a profound influence on the lives of individuals through symbols, rituals, and shared narratives.

Colles’ fracture a fracture of the distal end of the *radius, which is displaced backwards and upwards to produce a ‘dinner fork’ deformity. *Avulsion of the ulnar styloid process (see ulna) usually takes place as well. It is usually caused by a fall on the outstretched hand. The bone is restored to its normal position under anaesthesia, and a plaster cast is applied for about six weeks. Complications are residual deformity and stiffness of the wrist. If the fall occurs from less than standing height, it is considered an insufficiency fracture and its presence, in the absence of any other underlying cause, suggests *osteoporosis. Early evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis is needed to prevent future fractures. Colles’ fractures are more common in women immediately after menopause. [A. Colles (1773–1843), Irish surgeon]

colliculus n. (pl. colliculi) a small protuberance or swelling. Two pairs of colliculi, the superior and inferior colliculi, protrude from the roof of the midbrain (see tectum).

collimator n. a device, used in diagnostic radiology or radiotherapy, to produce a narrow beam of radiation by means of metallic sheets, acting like a diaphragm in a camera, that control the size of the beam from a radiation source. Many newer *linear accelerators use multi-leaf collimators, a specialized form of collimator using individual ‘leaves’ (1 cm or smaller) to shape the radiation *treatment field around the tumour. Collimators are also used on radiation detectors, in particular in *gamma cameras, for which the exact source of radioactivity needs to be known to produce an accurate image.

collodion n. a syrupy solution of nitrocellulose in a mixture of alcohol and ether. When applied to the surface of the body it evaporates to leave a thin clear transparent skin, useful for the protection of minor wounds. Flexible collodion also contains camphor and castor oil, which allow the skin to stretch a little more.

colloidian baby the distinctive appearance of a newborn baby that is covered in a shiny membrane, resembling plastic wrap. This is usually the presentation of an underlying chronic skin disorders such as *ichthyosis, although about 10% of colloidian babies have normal underlying skin.

collyrium n. a medicated solution used to bathe the eyes.

coloboma n. a defect in the development of the eye causing abnormalities ranging in severity from a notch in the lower part of the iris, making the pupil pear-shaped, to defects in the retina, choroid, and optic nerve *fundus. A coloboma of the eyelid is a congenital notch in the lid margin.

colography (colonography) n. imaging of the colon. CT colography uses *computerized tomography to obtain multiple *axial thin-slice images (usually less than 3 mm thick), which can be electronically reformatted in two or three dimensions (see multiplanar reconstruction). It has the added advantage of visualizing all the other abdominal organs. Although less invasive than *colonoscopy, it cannot be used for biopsies or therapeutic procedures. MR colography, using *magnetic resonance imaging, is becoming more commonplace; its advantage over CT colography is that the patient is not exposed to irradiation.

colon n. the main part of the large intestine, which consists of four sections – the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colons (see illustration). The colon has no digestive function but it absorbs large amounts of water and electrolytes from the undigested food passed on from the small intestine. At intervals strong peristaltic movements move the dehydrated contents (faeces) towards the rectum. —colonic adj.

The colon.





colonic irrigation washing out the contents of the large bowel by means of copious enemas, using either water, with or without soap, or a liquid medication.

colonography n. see colography.

colonoscopy n. an invasive endoscopic procedure for examining the interior of the colon and the terminal ileum. A colonoscope is a flexible, steerable telescopic instrument that houses a high-definition digital video camera to allow direct visualization of the colonic mucosa. It is inserted into the anus and guided around the loops of the large bowel to the caecum and terminal ileum. Its progress may be aided by using an external *3-D magnetic imager (e.g. ScopeGuide). It is possible to obtain biopsies for microscopic examination using flexible forceps passed through the colonoscope (diagnostic colonoscopy) and to remove polyps, dilate strictures with endoscopic balloons, or insert self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) into benign or malignant strictures (therapeutic colonoscopy).

colony n. a discrete population or mass of microorganisms, usually bacteria, all of which are considered to have developed from a single parent cell. Bacterial colonies that grow on agar plates differ in shape, size, colour, elevation, translucency, and surface texture, depending on the species. This is used as a means of identification. See also culture.

colony-stimulating factor (CSF) one of a group of substances (haemopoietic growth factors or hormones) that are produced in the bone marrow and stimulate the production of specific blood cells. Genetically engineered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates neutrophil production and also limits bone marrow toxicity from chemotherapy.

colorectal cancer malignancy of the large intestine (i.e. the colon, appendix, and rectum). It is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer: one million people are diagnosed each year. Most cases should be preventable by screening and surveillance protocols (including the *faecal occult blood test) and modifiable lifestyle factors. Risk factors include older age, increased consumption of red meat and fatty foods, excessive alcohol intake, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Clinical symptoms include change in bowel habit, rectal bleeding, loss of appetite and weight, anaemia, and gastrointestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is made following analysis of samples taken during *colonoscopy. CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis defines the extent of the disease; MRI and PET scanning may yield additional radiological information. These findings are assessed using the *TNM classification. Early localized disease is amenable to surgery, preoperative chemoradiation, and postoperative chemotherapy; advanced disease with metastases necessitates a palliative approach.

colorimeter n. an instrument for determining the concentration of a particular compound in a preparation by comparing the intensity of colour in it with that in a standard preparation of known concentration. The instrument is used particularly for measuring the amount of haemoglobin in the blood.

colostomy n. a surgical operation in which a part of the colon is brought through the anterior abdominal wall and an artificial opening is created in order to drain or decompress the contents of colon. The part of the colon chosen depends on the site of obstruction or the underlying disease process. Depending on the indication a colostomy may be temporary, eventually being closed after months or years to restore intestinal continuity; or permanent, when the colon distal to the colostomy has been removed or is diseased. A bag is worn over the colostomy opening (*stoma) to collect the faeces for disposal.

colostrum n. the first secretion from the breast, occurring shortly after, or sometimes before, birth prior to the secretion of true milk. It is a relatively clear fluid containing serum, white blood cells, and protective antibodies.

colour blindness any of various conditions in which certain colours are confused with one another. True lack of colour appreciation is extremely rare (see monochromat), but some defect of colour discrimination is present in about 8% of Caucasian males, and 0.4% of Caucasian females. The most common type of colour blindness is Daltonism (protanopia) – red-blindness – in which the person cannot distinguish between reds and greens. Occasional cases are due to acquired disease of the retina but in the vast majority it is inherited. The defect is thought to be in the functioning of the light-sensitive cells in the retina responsible for colour perception (see cone). See also deuteranopia; trichromatic.

colour flow ultrasound imaging see Doppler ultrasound.

colp- (colpo-) combining form denoting the vagina. Example: colpoplasty (plastic surgery of).

colpoperineorrhaphy n. an operation to repair tears in the vagina and the muscles surrounding its opening.

colporrhaphy n. an operation designed to remove lax and redundant vaginal tissue and so reduce the diameter of the vagina in cases of prolapse of the base of the bladder (anterior colporrhaphy; see cystocele) or of the rectum (posterior colporrhaphy; see rectocele).

colposcopy n. examination of the cervix under low-power binocular magnification and an intense light source. If abnormalities are revealed (identified as white areas after application of acetic acid, then iodine, to the cervix), a diagnostic biopsy is taken for histological assessment. Confirmation of the diagnosis is followed by appropriate treatment (see cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). —colposcopic adj.

colposuspension n. a surgical procedure for treating stress incontinence in women in which the upper part of the vaginal wall is fixed to the anterior abdominal wall by unabsorbable suture material. It may be performed through an abdominal incision (Burch colposuspension) or using a laparoscope (laparoscopic colposuspension). These techniques have now been largely replaced by other less invasive sling procedures, such as *tension-free vaginal tape.

columella n. (in anatomy) a part resembling a small column. For example, the columella cochleae (modiolus) is the central pillar of the cochlea, around which the spiral cochlear canal winds. The columella nasi is the anterior part of the nasal septum.

column n. (in anatomy) any pillar-shaped structure, especially any of the tracts of grey matter found in the spinal cord.

COM chronic otitis media (see otitis).

coma n. 1. a state of unrousable unconsciousness. See also Glasgow Coma Scale. 2. (in optics) an *aberration, inherent in certain optical designs or due to imperfection in the lens or cornea, that results in off-axis point sources (e.g. stars) appearing to have a tail, like the coma of a comet. —comatic adj.

co-magaldrox n. see aluminium hydroxide.

combined therapy therapy that combines several types of treatment in order to improve results. It is usually a combination of surgery with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for the treatment of malignant tumours (see adjuvant therapy). See also sandwich therapy.

Combitube n. trade name for an airway support device, initially designed for use by relatively untrained personnel on the battlefield, that is referred to in modern hospital resuscitation guidelines but rarely used. The device has two tubes and is introduced through the mouth blindly into the back of the throat. It may end up in either the oesophagus or the airway: ventilation is provided either through the hole in the end of the tracheal tube or via perforations in the side of the oesophageal tube.

comedo n. (pl. comedones) see blackhead.

commando operation a major operation performed to remove a malignant tumour from the head and neck. Extensive dissection, often involving the face, is followed by reconstruction to restore function and cosmetic acceptability.

commensal n. an organism that lives in close association with another of a different species without either harming or benefiting it. For example, some microorganisms living in the gut obtain both food and a suitable habitat but neither harm nor benefit humans. Compare symbiosis. —commensalism n.

comminuted fracture a fracture in which the bone is broken into more than two pieces. A crushing force is usually responsible and there is often extensive injury to surrounding soft tissues.

commissure n. 1. a bundle of nerve fibres that crosses the midline of the central nervous system, often connecting similar structures on each side. 2. any other tissue connecting two similar structures.

commotio retinae swelling of the retina, usually resulting from blunt trauma to the eye. The swelling usually resolves over a few days.

communicable disease (contagious disease, infectious disease) any disease that can be transmitted from one person to another. This may occur by direct physical contact, by common handling of an object that has picked up infective microorganisms (see fomes), through a disease *carrier, or by spread of infected droplets coughed or exhaled into the air. The most dangerous communicable diseases are on the list of *notifiable diseases. Specific legal obligations arise in respect of notifiable diseases by virtue of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 (as amended), delegated legislation, and the Health and Social Care Act 2008.

communicable disease control the control of disease due to infectious agents or their toxic products. See Consultant in Health Protection.

communicans adj. communicating or connecting. The term is applied particularly to blood vessels or nerve fibres connecting two similar structures.

communitarianism n. an approach to ethics and politics that advocates a middle way between communism and liberalism, emphasizing family and community interests as well as individual *autonomy, social responsibilities, and personal rights.

community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) see pneumonia.

community health preventive services, mainly outside the hospital, involving the surveillance of special groups of the population, such as preschool and school children, women, and the elderly, by means of routine clinical assessment and *screening tests. Routine preventive measures, such as immunization, family planning, and dietary advice, are offered in special clinics staffed by *community nurses, clinical medical officers, and senior clinical medical officers and sometimes by *community paediatricians. When somebody is identified as having an illness, he (or she) is referred for treatment to a *general practitioner or hospital as appropriate. See also child health clinic; school health service.

community hospital see hospital.

community interest group (in Britain) any of the groups that work with NHS foundation trusts to represent the views of patients and other interested parties in setting the strategic direction of the trust. They are often formed around specific disease categories or patient groups (e.g. deaf patients, children in care).

community medicine see public health medicine.

community mental health team (CMHT) a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists who treat patients with severe mental illness in the community.

community midwife (domiciliary midwife) (in Britain) a registered *nurse with special training in midwifery (both hospital and domiciliary practice). The midwife must be registered with the *Nursing and Midwifery Council in order to practise; this requires regular refresher courses to supplement the basic qualification of Registered Midwife (RM). Community midwives are attached to general practices or hospitals, and their work includes home deliveries and antenatal and postnatal care in the community.

community nurses (in Britain) a generic term for *health visitors, *community midwives, and *district nurses. See also domiciliary services.

community paediatrician a consultant in paediatrics with special responsibility for the care of children outside the hospital. See also community health.

comparative mortality figure see occupational mortality.

compartment n. (in anatomy) any one of the spaces in a limb that are bounded by bone and thick sheets of fascia and enclose the muscles and other tissues of the limb.

compartment syndrome the condition that results from swelling of the muscles in a *compartment of a limb, which raises the pressure within the compartment so that the blood supply to the muscle is cut off, causing *ischaemia and further swelling. If it persists, the muscles and nerves within the compartment die, leading to *Volkmann’s contracture (when the forearm is affected). Causes are trauma, damage to blood vessels, reperfusion after ischaemia, and tight casts or bandages. Treatment is to release any tight dressings and to divide the fascia surrounding the compartment to relieve the pressure (see fasciotomy). This should be performed urgently, within six hours from the onset of symptoms, to prevent permanent damage.

compassion n. the perception and, as far as is possible, understanding of another’s suffering, important as a motivation in all caring professions. However, overwork may destroy fellow-feeling (compassion fatigue): professionals should be aware of this possibility and make sure they are looking after themselves properly (see burnout). Kindness and understanding are often undervalued as components of treatment by professionals but not by patients.

compatibility n. the degree to which the body’s defence systems will tolerate the presence of intruding foreign material, such as blood when transfused or a kidney when transplanted. Complete compatibility exists between identical twins: a blood transfusion between identical twins will evoke no *antibody formation in the recipient. In severe incompatibility, for example between completely unrelated people, there are likely to be swift immune reactions as antibodies attack and destroy any offending antigenic material. See also histocompatibility; immunity. —compatible adj.

compensation n. 1. the act of making up for a functional or structural deficiency. For example, compensation for the loss of a diseased kidney is brought about by an increase in size of the remaining kidney, so restoring the urine-producing capacity. 2. financial redress for injury or loss caused, for example, by *negligence, usually weighed against. the degree of harm suffered.

competence n. see capacity.

complaints system a process that enables patients to voice concerns about the standard of care they receive. In the UK, any complaints should be raised as soon as possible, in the first instance locally with the NHS provider involved. Various statutory and voluntary advice and advocacy services are available to assist in this. If a patient is not satisfied with the outcome of local resolution, the matter can be referred to the *Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Legal action cannot usually proceed at the same time and only a small proportion of complaints proceed to law. Disciplinary procedures are separate from the complaints procedure although complaints may prompt or inform disciplinary action.

complement n. a system of functionally linked proteins that interact with one another to aid the body’s defences when *antibodies combine with *antigens. Complement is involved in the breaking-up (*lysis) and *opsonization of foreign organisms. It is also involved in inflammation and clearing immune (antigen-antibody) complexes.

complementary medicine various forms of therapy that are viewed as complementary to conventional medicine. These include (but are not confined to) *osteopathy, *acupuncture, *homeopathy, *massage, *aromatherapy, *reflexology, and *reiki. Previously, complementary therapies were regarded as an alternative to conventional therapies, and the two types were considered to be mutually exclusive (hence the former names alternative medicine and fringe medicine). However, many practitioners now have dual training in conventional and complementary therapies. There is very limited provision for complementary medicine within the National Health Service.

complement fixation the binding of *complement to the complex that is formed when an antibody reacts with a specific antigen. Because complement is taken up from the serum only when such a reaction has occurred, testing for the presence of complement after mixing a suspension of a known organism with a patient’s serum can give confirmation of infection with a suspected organism. The *Wassermann reaction for diagnosing syphilis is a complement-fixation test.

complex n. 1. (in psychoanalysis) an emotionally charged and repressed group of ideas and beliefs that is capable of influencing an individual’s behaviour. The term in this sense was originally used by Jung, but it is now widely used in a looser sense to denote an unconscious motive. 2. (in medicine) a patient’s presentation in which there are a multitude of co-morbidities and/or social and psychological problems.

complex partial seizure see epilepsy.

complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, RSD, Sudek’s atrophy) neurological dysfunction in a limb following trauma, surgery, or disease, characterized by intense burning pain, swelling, stiffness, and sweaty shiny mottled skin. It is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The *ESR is often elevated, X-rays may reveal some patchy osteoporosis, and a bone scan usually demonstrates increased blood flow. Early treatment with splinting and physiotherapy are essential, in combination with *sympatholytic drugs, corticosteroids, and regional sympathetic blocks; *sympathectomy may be required in chronic cases.

compliance n. see adherence.

complication n. a disease or condition arising during the course of or as a consequence of another disease.

compomer (polyacid-modified resin composite) n. a dental filling material that is a hybrid of *composite resin and *glass ionomer.

composite resin a tooth-coloured restorative material for teeth. It is composed of two different materials: an inorganic filler chemically held in an organic resin. Composite resins are bonded to teeth using the *acid-etch technique and usually hardened by polymerization initiated by intense light.

compress n. a pad of material soaked in hot or cold water and applied to an injured part of the body to relieve the pain of inflammation.

compressed air illness (caisson disease) a syndrome occurring in people working under high pressure in diving bells or at great depths with breathing apparatus. On return to normal atmospheric pressure nitrogen dissolved in the bloodstream expands to form bubbles, causing pain (the bends) and blocking the circulation in small blood vessels in the brain and elsewhere (decompression sickness). Pain, paralysis, and other features may be eliminated by returning the victim to a higher atmospheric pressure and reducing this gradually, so causing the bubbles to redissolve. Chronic compressed air illness may cause damage to the bones (see osteonecrosis), heart, and lungs.

compression venography an *ultrasound technique to look for deep vein *thrombosis. Pressing the vein with the ultrasound probe usually causes it to empty and flatten, which does not occur if there is thrombus in the lumen. See also venography.

compulsion n. an *obsession that takes the form of a motor act, such as repetitive washing based on a fear of contamination, as seen in *obsessive–compulsive disorder.

compulsory admission (involuntary admission) (in Britain) the entry and detention of a person within an institution without his or her consent, either because of mental illness (see Mental Health Act) or severe social deprivation and self-neglect (see section 47 removal). Compare voluntary admission.

computer-assisted surgery (image-guided surgery, surgical navigation) a technique by which a virtual image or map of the patient is created from CT scans, MRI scans, X-rays, or ultrasound scans and loaded into a computer. Special instruments connected to the computer are then applied to certain reference points on the patient. The computer can then produce a picture of the location of the instrument within the patient.

computerized radiography (CR) a system for replacing photographic film with a charged plate. Exposure to X-rays knocks charge off the plate. The resultant image can be read by a laser beam and stored digitally or printed out as required. This system is widely used in conjunction with *PACS systems.

computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) see angiography.

computerized tomography (CT) a form of X-ray examination in which the X-ray source and detector (CT scanner) rotate around the object to be scanned and the information obtained can be used to produce cross-sectional images (see cross-sectional imaging) by computer (a CT scan). A higher radiation dose is received by the patient than with some conventional X-ray techniques, but the diagnostic information obtained is far greater and should outweigh the increased risk. CT scanning can be used for all parts of the body. The data obtained can be used to construct three-dimensional images of structures of interest. See also multidetector computerized tomography; spiral CT scanning.

conception n. 1. (in gynaecology) the start of pregnancy, when a male germ cell (sperm) fertilizes a female germ cell (ovum) in the *Fallopian tube. 2. (in psychology) an idea or mental impression.

conceptus n. the products of conception: the developing fetus and its enclosing membrane at all stages in the uterus.

concha n. (pl. conchae) (in anatomy) any part resembling a shell. For example, the concha auriculae is a depression on the outer surface of the pinna (auricle), which leads to the external auditory meatus of the outer ear. See also nasal concha.

concomitant adj. at the same time: describing drugs that are administered together or symptoms that occur during the same period.

concordance n. 1. similarity of any physical characteristic that is found in both of a pair of twins. 2. (in ethics) agreement between individuals or points of view.

concretion n. a stony mass formed within such an organ as the kidney, especially the coating of an internal organ (or a foreign body, such as a urinary catheter) with calcium salts. See also calculus.

concussion n. a condition caused by injury to the head, characterized by headache, confusion, and amnesia. These symptoms may be prolonged and constitute a post-concussional syndrome. There may be no recognizable structural damage to the brain, but scans may reveal evidence of *contusion (bruising) within the brain. Repeated concussion eventually causes symptoms suggesting brain damage. See also punch-drunk syndrome.

condenser n. (in microscopy) an arrangement of lenses beneath the stage of a microscope. It can be adjusted to provide correct focusing of light on the microscope slide.

conditioned reflex a reflex in which the response occurs not to the sensory stimulus that normally causes it but to a separate stimulus, which has been learnt to be associated with it. In Pavlov’s classic experiments, dogs learned to associate the sound of a bell with feeding time and would salivate at the bell’s sound whether food was then presented to them or not.

conditioning n. the establishment of new behaviour by modifying the stimulus/response associations. In classical conditioning a stimulus not normally associated with a particular response is presented together with the stimulus that evokes the response automatically. This is repeated until the first stimulus evokes the response by itself (see conditioned reflex). In operant conditioning a response is rewarded (or punished) each time it occurs, so that in time it comes to occur more (or less) frequently (see reinforcement).

condom n. a sheath made of latex rubber, plastic, or silk that is fitted over the penis during sexual intercourse. Use of a condom protects both partners against sexually transmitted diseases (including AIDS) and, carefully used, it is a reasonably reliable contraceptive (between 2 and 10 pregnancies per 100 woman-years). A more recent development is the female condom (e.g. Femidom), which is fitted into the vagina. Manufactured from similar materials as male condoms, they too act as both contraceptives and as barriers to sexually transmitted diseases.

conduct disorder a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive or otherwise antisocial behaviour. It is usually recognized in childhood or adolescence and may include such behaviours as unusually frequent and severe temper tantrums, arguing with adults, defying rules, being angry and resentful, cruelty to animals, lying or breaking promises, use of weapons, sexual aggression, destroying property, truancy, bullying, and general delinquency. It can lead to *antisocial personality disorder. Treatment is usually with *behaviour therapy or *family therapy, although there is some debate as to whether it should be seen as a social rather than a medical problem.

conducting tissue a collection of specialized cells that transmits electricity within the heart. It may be normal (e.g. the *sinoatrial node) or abnormal (e.g. an *accessory pathway).

condylarthrosis (condyloid joint) n. a form of *diarthrosis (freely movable joint) in which an ovoid head fits into an elliptical cavity. Examples are the knee joint and the joint between the mandible (lower jaw) and the temporal bone of the skull.

condyle n. a rounded protuberance that occurs at the ends of some bones, e.g. the *occipital bone, and forms an articulation with another bone.

condyloma n. (pl. condylomata) a raised wartlike growth. Condylomata acuminata (sing. condyloma acuminatum) are warts caused by *human papillomavirus and are found on the vulva, under the foreskin, or on the skin of the anal region. They may be treated with podophyllin, trichloroacetic acid, topical *imiquimod, or cryotherapy; patients should be checked for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases. Condylomata lata (sing. condyloma latum) are flat plaques found in the secondary stage of syphilis, occurring in the anogenital region.

cone n. one of the two types of light-sensitive cells in the *retina of the eye (compare rod). The human retina contains 6–7 million cones; they function best in bright light and are essential for acute vision (receiving a sharp accurate image). The area of the retina called the *fovea contains the greatest concentration of cones. Cones can also distinguish colours. It is thought that there are three types of cone, each sensitive to the wavelength of a different primary colour – red, green, or blue. Other colours are seen as combinations of these three primary colours.

cone beam see image-guided radiotherapy.

cone biopsy surgical removal, by knife or laser, of a cone-shaped segment of tissue from the cervix of the uterus. It may be performed if a cervical biopsy (see colposcopy) reveals evidence of cervical carcinoma in situ (*cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 3): the abnormal tissue is removed and examined microscopically for confirmation of complete removal of the abnormality.

confabulation n. the invention of circumstantial but fictitious detail about events supposed to have occurred in the past. Usually this is to disguise an inability to remember past events. It may be a symptom of any form of loss of memory, but typically occurs in *Korsakoff’s syndrome.

confection n. (in pharmacy) a sweet substance that is combined with a medicinal preparation to make it suitable for administration.

confidence interval (in statistics) a range of values for a parameter of interest that is estimated to contain the true value of the parameter within a given probability. For example, with a 95% confidence interval the parameter value will lie in this interval 95 times out of every 100.

confidential enquiries special enquiries that seek to improve health and health care by collecting evidence on aspects of care and disseminating recommendations based on these findings. MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies; Reducing Risks through Audits and Confidential Enquiries in the UK) investigates maternal deaths, stillbirths, late fetal losses and terminations, and neonatal deaths (see infant mortality rate; maternal death; maternal mortality rate; perinatal mortality rate). It replaced the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), which carried out this work until 2012. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death investigates general medical and surgical care, and the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness covers the care of people with mental illness. *NHS England manages the contracts with the confidential enquiries.

confidentiality n. an ethical and legal obligation that requires doctors to keep information about their patients private. It is the foundation on which trust and the therapeutic relationship is built. A doctor automatically assumes such an obligation during a patient consultation. Confidentiality is generally considered to be held within the health-care team rather than with one particular professional in order to facilitate effective care, although stricter rules can apply in *genitourinary medicine and occupational health (among others). Confidentiality is not an unlimited duty and sometimes it is permissible or even obligatory to breach a patient’s confidence, e.g. for child protection or when a patient suffers from a *notifiable disease. Confidentiality may also be breached where there is a serious risk of physical harm to an identifiable individual or individuals. However, since there is no ‘duty to warn’ in the UK, doctors are not obliged to breach confidentiality where there is a serious risk of harm. The GMC requires that doctors should be prepared to justify their decision whether or not they decide to breach confidentiality in cases of serious risk. See also data protection; privacy. —confidential adj.

conflict n. (in psychology) the state produced when a stimulus produces two opposing reactions. The basic types of conflict situation are approach–approach, in which the individual is drawn towards two attractive – but mutually incompatible – goals; approach–avoidance, where the stimulus evokes reactions both to approach and to avoid; and avoidance–avoidance, in which the avoidance reaction to one stimulus would bring the individual closer to an equally unpleasant stimulus. Conflict has been used to explain the development of neurotic disorders, and the resolution of conflict remains an important part of psychoanalysis. See also conversion.

conflict of interest (in medical ethics) the situation in which a health professional is subject to potential or actual pressures that may conflict with his or her obligation to promote the *best interests of the patient over and above all else. A conflict of interest arises from a particular context or situation and may threaten a doctor’s integrity and undermine trust between professional and patient. For example, a drug company may encourage a doctor to prescribe a particular medicine, which may not be the treatment of choice for a patient, or contractual financial disincentives may discourage a doctor from providing a more expensive treatment of choice for a patient. In medical research, there is always a potential conflict between protecting the individual and benefiting society. Particular problems of this kind occur in randomized controlled trials (see equipoise; intervention study). Doctors will always experience competing pressures and it is important for them to be able to recognize and then, where possible, disclose, resolve, or mitigate morally problematic conflicts.

confluence n. a point of coalescence. The confluence of the sinuses is the meeting point of the superior sagittal, transverse, straight, and occipital venous sinuses in the dura mater in the occipital region of the skull.

confocal microscopy a light microscopic technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast.

confounding n. the situation in which an apparent association between two *variables is in fact explained by a third variable that correlates with one or both of the variables under investigation. If confounding is not recognized, it can lead to the false assumption that two variables are directly related, known as a spurious correlation.

congenital adj. describing a condition that is recognized at birth or that is believed to have been present since birth. Congenital malformations include all disorders present at birth whether they are inherited or caused by an environmental factor.

congenital adrenal hyperplasia a family of autosomal *recessive genetic disorders causing decreased activity of any of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of *cortisol from *cholesterol. The most commonly affected enzymes are 21-hydroxylase and 11-hydroxylase, and each enzyme deficiency can itself be due to a variety of genetic mutations. The clinical manifestations depend on which enzyme is affected and the resultant deficiencies and build-up products produced. The most serious consequence is adrenal crisis and/or severe salt wasting due to lack of cortisol and/or aldosterone, which may prove fatal if undiagnosed. The condition is often easier to spot at birth in females, who may have indeterminate genitalia due to high levels of *testosterone in utero. Adrenal hyperplasia occurs due to excessive stimulation of the glands by *ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) in response to the resultant cortisol deficiency of these conditions. Less complete deficiencies of the enzymes concerned may present for the first time in young women after puberty, with signs of androgen excess and menstrual irregularity mimicking *polycystic ovary syndrome.

congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) herniation of the fetal abdominal organs into the fetal chest, which occurs in one in 2000–5000 live births. This leads to pulmonary *hypoplasia, which is the main cause of the associated high neonatal mortality. The risk of pulmonary hypoplasia is substantially greater where there is herniation of the liver into the thoracic cavity. CDH is commonly associated with additional structural abnormalities (cardiac, neural tube defects, and exomphalos), and the risk of chromosomal abnormality (*aneuploidy) is 10–20%. Demonstration of a fluid-filled bowel at the level of the heart on ultrasound is diagnostic.

congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) an abnormality present at birth in which the head of the femur is displaced or easily displaceable from the acetabulum (socket) of the ilium, which is poorly developed; it frequently affects both hip joints. CDH occurs in about 1.5 per 1000 live births, being more common in first-born girls, in breech deliveries, and if there is a family history of the condition. The leg is shortened and has a reduced range of movement, and the skin creases may be asymmetrical. All babies are routinely screened for CDH at birth and at developmental check-ups by gentle manipulation of the hip causing it to be reduced and dislocated with a clunk (see Barlow manoeuvre; Ortolani manoeuvre). The diagnosis is confirmed by X-ray or ultrasound scan. Treatment is with a special harness holding the hip in the correct position. If this is unsuccessful, the hip is reduced under anaesthetic and held with a plaster of Paris cast or the defect is corrected by surgery. Successful treatment of an infant can give a normal hip; if the dislocation is not detected, the hip does not develop normally and osteoarthritis develops at a young age.

congenitally corrected transposition see transposition of the great vessels.

congestion n. an accumulation of blood within an organ due to back pressure within its veins (for example congestion of the lungs and of the liver occurs in heart failure). Congestion may be associated with *oedema (accumulation of fluid in the tissues). It is relieved by treatment of the cause.

congestive cardiac failure (CCF, congestive heart failure) see heart failure.

Congo red a dark-red or reddish-brown pigment that becomes blue in acidic conditions. It is used as a histological *stain. *Amyloidosis is indicated if over 60% of the dye disappears from the blood within one hour of injection.

coniine n. an extremely poisonous alkaloid, found in hemlock (Conium maculatum), that paralyses the nerves, mainly the motor nerves. Coniine has been included in drug preparations for the treatment of asthma and whooping cough.

coning n. prolapse of the brainstem through the *foramen magnum as a result of raised intracranial pressure: it is usually immediately fatal. A similar emergency can occur through the hiatus of the *tentorium.

conization n. surgical removal of a cone of tissue. The technique is commonly used in excising a portion of the cervix (neck) of the uterus (see cone biopsy) for the treatment of cervicitis or early cancer (carcinoma in situ).

conjoined twins identical twins that are physically joined together at birth, known colloquially as Siamese twins. The condition ranges from twins joined only by the umbilical blood vessels (allantoido-angiopagous twins) to those in whom conjoined heads or trunks are inseparable.

conjugate (conjugate diameter, true conjugate) n. the distance between the front and rear of the pelvis measured from the most prominent part of the sacrum to the back of the pubic symphysis. Since the true conjugate cannot normally be measured during life it is estimated by subtracting 1.3–1.9 cm from the diagonal conjugate, the distance between the lower edge of the symphysis and the sacrum (usually about 12.7 cm). If the true conjugate is less than about 10.2 cm, delivery of an infant through the natural passages may be difficult or impossible, and *Caesarean section may have to be performed.

conjugation n. the union of two microorganisms in which genetic material (DNA) passes from one organism to the other. In bacteria minute projections on the donor ‘male’ cell (pili) form a bridge with the recipient ‘female’ cell; the exact function of the pili is not known, but they are believed to have an important role in conjugation.

conjunctiva n. the delicate mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelids. The conjunctiva lining the eyelids contains many blood vessels but that over the eyeball contains few and is transparent. —conjunctival adj.

conjunctivitis (pink eye) n. inflammation of the conjunctiva, which becomes red and swollen and produces a watery or pus-containing discharge. It causes discomfort rather than pain and does not usually affect vision. Conjunctivitis may be caused by infection by bacteria or viruses (in which case it usually spreads rapidly to the other eye) or physical or chemical irritation. The patient usually recovers with no after-effects in one to three weeks; bacterial infections respond to antibiotic eye drops. Allergic (or vernal) conjunctivitis is acute or chronic inflammation of the cornea usually due to a specific allergen, such as pollen, animal danders, or dust. It is characterized by itching, irritation, redness, watering of the eyes, and light sensitivity. See also inclusion conjunctivitis; trachoma.

connective tissue the tissue that supports, binds, or separates more specialized tissues and organs or functions as a packing tissue of the body. It consists of an amorphous ground substance of mucopolysaccharides in which may be embedded white (collagenous), yellow (elastic), and reticular fibres, fat cells, *fibroblasts, *mast cells, and *macrophages (see illustration). Variations in chemical composition of the ground substance and in the proportions and quantities of cells and fibres give rise to tissues of widely differing characteristics, including bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments as well as *adipose, *areolar, and *elastic tissues.

Connective tissue. Loose (areolar) connective tissue.





connective-tissue disease any one of a group of diseases that are characterized by inflammatory changes in connective tissue and can affect virtually any body system. Formerly known as collagen diseases (connective-tissue disease has been the preferred term since 1978), they include *dermatomyositis, systemic and discoid *lupus erythematosus, *morphoea, *polyarteritis nodosa, and *rheumatoid arthritis.

Conn’s syndrome the combination of muscular weakness, abnormally intense thirst (polydipsia), the production of large volumes of urine (polyuria), and hypertension, resulting from excessive production of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (see aldosteronism). It is a rare cause of hypertension. [W. J. Conn (1907–94), US physician]

consanguinity n. relationship by blood; the sharing of a common ancestor within a few generations.

conscientious objection a refusal to behave in a socially or legally accepted way because such behaviour is counter to one’s personal beliefs, principles, or values. Conscientious objection is commonly, but not always, based on religious belief. In some areas of medical practice, there is legal provision allowing for conscientious objection; for example, by virtue of the Abortion Act 1967, section 4(1), a doctor can lawfully refuse to perform an abortion on the grounds of a conscientious objection but must refer the patient to a colleague who will carry out the procedure. Adherents of some religious denominations, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, may refuse life-saving treatments, frequently those involving blood products, on the grounds of conscience and religious belief, and provided the patient has capacity, a doctor is bound to respect the wishes or *autonomy of the patient.

consent n. agreement to undergo any medical treatment or to participate in medical research. Three criteria must be met for consent to be legally valid, namely that the patient must: (i) have capacity to make a choice; (ii) be provided with sufficient information (see informed consent) as to the nature of treatment, its likely consequences, and the possible effects of not having treatment; (iii) be in a position to decide voluntarily, i.e. without external pressure or influence, which may entail giving the patient time to consider the options. In addition, the patient should be informed that they can change their mind about treatment at any point. Valid consent usually provides a legal defence against the charge of *battery (trespass against the person). Claims of *negligence may be brought if the doctor discloses insufficient or inadequate information or fails to answer the patient’s questions and address his or her concerns. Consent need not be in writing, but the more invasive the treatment proposed the greater the need for evidence of consent to be recorded. Signed consent forms are commonly used for this purpose, and are legally required when recruiting a subject to a clinical trial. Valid consent is not required in an emergency or where a patient lacks capacity. The concept of *therapeutic privilege formerly provided a further exception to the requirement that patients should give valid consent, but its scope of application is now much more narrowly defined. See also assent; autonomy.

consequentialism n. a variety of ethical theories arguing that the morality of an action, rule, or way of life can be determined by its outcome or consequences, rather than by its intrinsic nature or the motives or character of those performing or following it. The best known example of consequentialism is *utilitarianism, which in general seeks to achieve maximum utility or good outcomes for the greatest possible number of people in society.

In medical ethics, the principles of *beneficence and *nonmaleficence can be seen as consequentialist in their concern with outcomes but also as *deontological in that they are regarded as duties. A *cost–benefit analysis or *risk–benefit analysis on utilitarian principles is often carried out when distributing medical resources or deciding between treatments. A calculation of this kind also forms the basis of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) system (see quality of life).

A major objection to consequentialism is that the consequences of actions cannot always be predicted or perceived. Questions also arise regarding the likelihood of the consequences, whom they will affect (individuals, populations, animals, the environment), and by whom and what means they should be evaluated. —consequentialist adj.

conservative treatment treatment aimed at preventing a condition from becoming worse, in the expectation that either natural healing will occur or progress of the disease will be so slow that no drastic treatment will be justified. Compare radical treatment.

consolidation n. 1. the state of the lung in which the alveoli (air sacs) are filled with fluid produced by inflamed tissue, as in *pneumonia. It is diagnosed from its dullness to *percussion, bronchial breathing (see breath sounds) in the patient, and from the distribution of shadows on the chest X-ray. 2. the stage of repair of a broken bone following *callus formation, during which the callus is transformed by *osteoblasts into mature bone.

constipation n. a condition in which bowel evacuations occur infrequently, or in which the faeces are hard and small, or where passage of faeces causes difficulty or pain. The frequency of bowel evacuation varies considerably from person to person. Constipation developing in a person of previously regular bowel habit may be a symptom of intestinal disease and may require further investigation. Recurrent or longstanding constipation is treated by increasing fluid intake, *dietary fibre (roughage), *laxatives, or *enemas, and by withdrawing medications that promote constipation (such as opiates). Faecal impaction, the end-result of chronic constipation (more common in the elderly and the very young), often requires manual removal of the faecal bolus (faecal disimpaction), sometimes under an anaesthetic.

constrictor n. any muscle that compresses an organ or causes a hollow organ or part to contract.

consultant n. a fully trained specialist in a branch of medicine. In Britain, consultants are responsible for the care of patients within a distinct specialty, usually in hospital wards, but they are allowed to opt for some sessions in private practice in addition to any National Health Service commitments. After completion of the *Foundation Programme and (from 2019) the Internal Medicine Training programme doctors continuing in hospital service undertake further training as specialty registrars in their chosen specialty. When a specialty registrar has successfully completed a defined college or faculty specialist training programme, he or she is awarded a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and is eligible to apply for a consultant post. See also Doctor.

Consultant in Health Protection (CHP) a consultant within *Public Health England who is responsible for the surveillance, prevention, and control of communicable disease and noncommunicable environmental exposures. While no longer the preferred term, the older form Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) is still sometimes used. See also public health consultant.

consumption n. any disease causing wasting of tissues, especially (formerly) pulmonary tuberculosis. —consumptive adj.

contact n. transmission of an infectious disease by touching or handling an infected person or animal (direct contact) or by indirect contact with airborne droplets, faeces, etc., containing the infective microorganism.

contact lenses lenses worn directly against the eye, separated from it only by a film of tear fluid. Corneal microlenses cover only the cornea, while haptic lenses cover some of the surrounding sclera as well. Contact lenses are used mainly in place of spectacles, to correct errors of refraction, but also in a protective capacity (see bandage lens). Contact lenses are made of a variety of materials, such as glass, plastic, and silicone; soft gas-permeable lenses have mostly replaced hard Perspex lenses.

contact therapy a form of *radiotherapy in which a radioactive substance is brought into close contact with the part of the body being treated. Needles or capsules of the isotope may be implanted in or around a tumour so that the radiation they emit will destroy it. Compare teletherapy.

contagious disease originally, a disease transmitted only by direct physical contact: now usually taken to mean any *communicable disease.

continent diversion see urinary diversion.

continuity of care a continuous relationship between a patient and an identified health-care professional who is the sole source of care and information for the patient. However, as a patient’s health-care needs over time can rarely be met by a single professional, multiprofessional pathways of continuity exist to achieve both quality of care and patient satisfaction.

continuous patient pathway the route that a patient takes through the health-care system, from first admission to a hospital or treatment centre to final discharge. This may consist of one or more *spells in particular hospitals and one or more *finished consultant episodes. For example, a patient admitted to a district general hospital, transferred to a tertiary hospital for a specialist procedure, and then transferred back to the district general hospital for recovery would experience one continuous patient pathway but three spells.

continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) an air pressure in the range 5–30 cm H2O (1.2–7.5 mPa). It can be applied to the upper airways using a full face mask or a nasal mask only (nCPAP). It is used in high-dependency units to optimize oxygen delivery to patients who are being weaned from ventilators and on patients at home with *obstructive sleep apnoea. It works by improving nasopharyngeal airways, reducing the work of breathing, and preventing basal *atelectasis during sleep.

continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion the administration of insulin by continuous infusion into the subcutaneous tissue via a small pump worn under the clothing and connected to the skin by a tube and a fine needle. The insulin is delivered at a precalculated background rate, but patient-activated *boluses can be administered at meal times. This method is particularly appropriate (as an alternative to regular injections) for patients with repeated or unpredictable episodes of hypoglycaemia.

contra- prefix denoting against or opposite. Example: contraversion (turning away from).

contraception n. the prevention of unwanted pregnancy, which can be achieved by various means. Hormonal contraceptives (combined oestrogen and progestogen or progestogen only) act by preventing ovulation. They are usually taken in regular oral doses (see oral contraceptive), but may also be administered through the skin, by means of an adhesive patch impregnated with the hormones, or by three- or two-monthly injections of a long-acting progestogen. More recently developed methods for continuous administration of the hormones include subcutaneous implants of progestogen (Nexplanon) and hormonal intrauterine devices (see IUS). Methods that aim to prevent fertilization of the ovum include *coitus interruptus, the *condom, the *diaphragm, and surgical intervention (tubal occlusion and vasectomy: see sterilization). Methods that aim to prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum in the uterus include the intrauterine contraceptive device (see IUCD); these methods can be used after intercourse but before implantation (see postcoital contraception). Couples whose religious beliefs forbid the use of mechanical or hormonal contraceptives may use the *rhythm method, in which intercourse is limited to those days in the menstrual cycle when conception is least likely.

contraction n. the shortening of a muscle in response to a motor nerve impulse. This generates tension in the muscle, usually causing movement.

contracture n. *fibrosis of skeletal muscle or connective tissue producing shortening and resulting in deformity of a joint. See also Dupuytren’s contracture; Volkmann’s contracture.

contraindication n. any factor in a patient’s condition that makes it unwise to pursue a certain line of treatment. For example, an attack of pneumonia in a patient would be a strong contraindication against the use of a general anaesthetic.

contralateral adj. on or affecting the opposite side of the body: applied particularly to paralysis (or other symptoms) occurring on the opposite side of the body from the brain lesion that caused them.

contralateral-routing-of-signal hearing aid (CROS hearing aid) a form of hearing aid used to help people with severe or profound unilateral hearing loss. Sound information is collected by a microphone worn on the affected side and then transmitted by a thin wire or Bluetooth wireless technology to a device worn on the opposite side. If the hearing in the better ear is normal, no amplification is applied to the signal. If the better ear has a hearing loss the device also acts as a conventional hearing aid and amplifies the signal from both sides: this is known as a BICROS hearing aid.

contrast n. 1. short for *contrast medium, e.g. post-contrast CT scan. 2. the difference in the shade of grey between different tissues on a diagnostic image, such as radiograph or CT scan (see grey scale).

contrast medium (contrast agent) a substance administered to enhance the visibility of structures (i.e. increase the contrast) during imaging. In *radiography a positive contrast agent (e.g. *barium sulphate or a water-soluble iodine-containing compound) increases the density of a structure. Gas is a negative contrast agent. Positive and negative contrast media can be used together (e.g. barium sulphate and gas in a double-contrast *barium enema). Magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents contain either a positive contrast atom (usually gadolinium) to increase the signal or a negative contrast atom (such as iron) to decrease it. Ultrasound contrast medium consists of tiny (1–10 μm diameter) bubbles of gas, which reflect back the sound waves strongly. They can also be made to resonate or rupture to increase the signal to the ultrasound probe.

contrast nephropathy deterioration in renal function (of more than 25%) after administration of radiocontrast material. Development of this condition is more likely when there is pre-existing renal disease (the most important factor) or diabetes, vasoconstriction, simultaneous use of NSAIDs, and large amounts of radiocontrast are used. It is thought that the radiocontrast induces vasoconstriction in the vessels supplying the medulla of the kidney and aggravates hypoxia in this part of the kidney.

contrecoup n. injury of a part resulting from a blow on its opposite side. This may happen, for example, if a blow on the back of the head causes the front of the brain to be pushed against the inner surface of the skull.

controlled drug see Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) see superovulation.

controlled trial see intervention study.

contusion n. 1. see bruise. 2. any of various degrees of bruising of the brain (cerebral contusion), resulting from *head injury or surgery. Clinical signs range from *concussion to *coma, reflecting the severity of the trauma.

conus arteriosus the front upper portion of the right ventricle adjoining the pulmonary arteries.

conus medullaris the conical end of the spinal cord, at the level of the lower end of the first lumbar vertebra.

convergence n. 1. (in neurology) the formation of nerve tracts by fibres coming together into one pathway from different regions of the brain. 2. (in ophthalmology) the ability of the eyes to turn inwards and focus on a near point so that a single image is formed on both retinas. The closer the object, the greater the degree of convergence.

convergence insufficiency a condition in which the eyes fail to turn inwards enough to achieve fusion of separate images during near vision. In some cases, convergence exercises (see orthoptics) can improve the condition.

conversion n. (in psychiatry) the expression of *conflict as physical symptoms. Psychoanalysts believe that the repressed instinctual drive is manifested as motor or sensory loss, such as paralysis, rather than as speech or action. This is thought to be one of the ways in which *conversion disorder is produced. An easier way to conceptualize conversion is as a physical expression of emotional distress.

conversion disorder a psychological conflict or need that manifests itself as an organic dysfunction or physical symptom. The sufferer may display symptoms of blindness, deafness, loss of sensation, gait abnormalities, false memory, or paralysis of various parts of the body. None of these can be accounted for by organic disease. Conversion disorder was formerly known as *hysteria. It is classified with *dissociative disorders (as dissociative (conversion) disorders) in ICD-11 (see International Classification of Diseases). It is also included under the classification of *somatoform disorders.

conversion seizure see non-epileptic seizure.

convolution n. a folding or twisting, such as one of the many that cause the fissures, sulci, and gyri of the surface of the *cerebrum.

convulsion n. an involuntary contraction of the muscles producing contortion of the body and limbs. Rhythmic convulsions of the limbs are a feature of major *epilepsy. *Febrile convulsions are provoked by fever in otherwise healthy infants and young children.

Cooksey–Cawthorne exercises a series of physical exercises used in the rehabilitation of patients with certain forms of *vertigo.

Cooley’s anaemia see thalassaemia. [T. B. Cooley (1871–1945), US paediatrician]

Coombs’ test a means of detecting rhesus antibodies on the surface of red blood cells that precipitate proteins (globulins) in the blood serum. The test is used in the diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia in babies with rhesus incompatibility in whom there is destruction of red blood cells (see haemolytic disease of the newborn). [R. R. A. Coombs (1921–2006), British immunologist]

Copaxone n. see glatiramer.

COPD see chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

co-phenotrope n. a drug used in the treatment of diarrhoea. It consists of a mixture of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (an opioid that reduces *peristalsis) and atropine (which relaxes the smooth muscle of the gut) in a ratio of 100 to 1.

copr- (copro-) combining form denoting faeces. Example: coprophobia (abnormal fear of).

coprolalia n. the repetitive speaking of obscene words. It can be involuntary, as part of *Tourette’s syndrome.

coprolith n. see faecalith.

coproporphyrin n. a *porphyrin compound formed during the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX, a precursor of *haem. Coproporphyrin is excreted in the faeces in hereditary coproporphyria.

copulation n. see coitus.

cor n. the heart.

coracoid process a beaklike process that curves upwards and forwards from the top of the *scapula, over the shoulder joint.

cord n. any long flexible structure, which may be solid or tubular. Examples include the spermatic cord, spinal cord, umbilical cord, and vocal cord.

cordectomy n. surgical removal of a vocal cord or, more usually, a piece of the vocal cord (partial cordectomy).

cordocentesis n. the removal of a sample of fetal blood by inserting a fine hollow needle through the abdominal wall of a pregnant woman, under ultrasound guidance, into the umbilical vein. Cordocentesis is most commonly performed for confirmation of fetal *packed cell volume prior to intrauterine transfusion in cases of haemolytic disease of the newborn or for confirmation of infection in the fetus. See also fetal blood sampling.

cordotomy n. a surgical procedure for the relief of severe and persistent pain in the pelvis or lower limbs. The nerve fibres that transmit the sensation of pain to consciousness pass up the spinal cord in special tracts (the spinothalamic tracts). In cordotomy the spinothalamic tracts are severed in the cervical (neck) region.

cord presentation the position of the umbilical cord when it lies below the presenting part of the fetus in an intact bag of membranes. See also cord prolapse.

cord prolapse rupture of the membranes in cases of a *cord presentation. It is an obstetric emergency: there is a severe risk of cord compression and spasm causing fetal asphyxia (see hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy). Delivery must occur as soon as possible and the presenting part displaced away from the cord.

Cordylobia n. see tumbu fly.

corectopia n. displacement of the pupil towards one side from its normal position in the centre of the iris. When present from birth, the displacement is usually inwards towards the nose. Scarring of the iris from inflammation may also draw the pupil out of position.

co-registration (fusion imaging) n. (in diagnostic imaging) the process of taking two images obtained by different techniques and (usually electronically) laying them on top of each other after suitable adjustment, so that the anatomical landmarks coincide. This can give more accurate information as one technique shows the anatomy and the other shows the pathology. Co-registering can thus show which part of the body is involved in the disease process. It is typically used in *PET/CT scanning. CT or MRI scans can also be fused onto real time ultrasound images to target a lesion for biopsy or treatment.

corium n. see dermis.

corn n. an area of hard thickened skin on or between the toes or elsewhere on the foot: a type of *callosity produced by ill-fitting shoes. The horny skin layers form an inverted pyramid that presses down into the deeper skin layers, causing pain. A corn may be treated by applying salicylic acid or by podiatry.

cornea n. the transparent circular part of the front of the eyeball. It refracts the light entering the eye onto the lens, which then focuses it onto the retina. The cornea contains no blood vessels and it is extremely sensitive to pain. The innermost layer (corneal endothelium) consists of a single layer of cells that cannot regenerate. —corneal adj.

corneal arcus a white or greyish line in the periphery of the cornea, concentric with but separated from the edge by a clear zone. It begins above and below but may become a continuous ring. It consists of an infiltration of fatty material and is common in the elderly (arcus senilis). When it occurs in younger people (arcus juvenilis) it may indicate *hyperlipidaemia. It does not affect vision.

corneal graft see keratoplasty.

corneal reflex reflex blinking of both eyes normally elicited by lightly touching the cornea of one eye. This reflex is lost in deep coma, during general anaesthesia, and in death; it is therefore one of the tests used to confirm brainstem death.

corneal ring a ring designed to be inserted into the peripheral tissue of the cornea in order to alter the curvature of the corneal surface. It is undergoing trials to assess its ability to correct errors of refraction. In myopia (short-sightedness), for example, the ring would be required to stretch the corneal tissue peripherally and thus flatten the central corneal curvature in order to correct the myopia.

corneal topography (videokeratography) an imaging technique used to study the shape and refractive power of the cornea in detail. An image projected onto the cornea is analysed by a computer to produce a representation of the shape and refractive power of the corneal surface. Corneal topography has an important role in the management of corneal disease and refractive surgery.

cornification n. see keratinization.

cornu n. (pl. cornua) (in anatomy) a horn-shaped structure, such as the horn-shaped processes of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. See also horn.

coronary angiography an X-ray technique for examination of the coronary arteries, often taken to also include examination of the chambers of the heart. A catheter is introduced via the radial artery at the wrist or the femoral artery at the groin and manipulated into the heart under X-ray control. *Contrast medium is then injected to outline the ventricles and coronary arteries. Digital video images are recorded during contrast-medium injection. Coronary angiography is used to diagnose cardiac disease, specifically narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries, and plan treatment by surgery or radiological interventional techniques (see coronary artery bypass graft; percutaneous coronary intervention). It has now largely been replaced by CT coronary angiography.

coronary angioplasty a procedure in which a narrowed segment of coronary artery is stretched (dilated) by the inflation of a balloon introduced into it by means of cardiac *catheterization under X-ray screening (see angioplasty). In most cases a *stent is then implanted into the angioplastied segment as this improves duration.

coronary arteries the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The right and left coronary arteries arise from the aorta, just above the aortic valve, and form branches encircling the heart. See coronary angioplasty; coronary artery bypass graft.

coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) *coronary revascularization in which a segment of a coronary artery narrowed by atheroma is bypassed by an *autologous section of healthy saphenous vein or internal mammary artery at *thoracotomy. The improved blood flow resulting from one or more such grafts relieves *angina pectoris and reduces the risk of *myocardial infarction. Recently developed techniques of *minimally invasive surgery have enabled the operation to be performed without the need for thoracotomy.

coronary artery disease (CAD) *atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, which may cause *angina pectoris and lead to *myocardial infarction. One of the leading causes of death in Western countries, the disease occurs most frequently in populations with diets high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. Other risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.

coronary care unit (CCU) a designated ward of a hospital to which the most serious cardiac cases are transferred for specialist monitoring and treatment.

coronary revascularization the restoration of blood flow to ischaemic heart muscle (see ischaemia) by *coronary angioplasty and *stenting or by a *coronary artery bypass graft.

coronary thrombosis the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in the coronary artery, which obstructs the flow of blood to the heart. This is usually due to underlying *atheroma of the arterial wall, and results in the death (infarction) of part of the heart muscle. For symptoms and treatment, see myocardial infarction.

coroner n. the official who presides at an *inquest. He or she must be either a medical practitioner or a lawyer of at least five years’ standing.

coronoid process 1. a process on the upper end of the *ulna. It forms part of the notch that articulates with the humerus. 2. the process on the ramus of the *mandible to which the temporalis muscle is attached.

cor pulmonale enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart due to excessive pressure loading that results from diseases of the lungs or the pulmonary arteries. Such diseases include those affecting the structure of the lungs (e.g. emphysema) or their function (e.g. obesity) except when these changes result from congenital heart disease or diseases primarily affecting the left side of the heart.

corpus n. (pl. corpora) any mass of tissue that can be distinguished from its surroundings.

corpus albicans the residual body of scar tissue that remains in the ovary at the point where a *corpus luteum has regressed after its secretory activity has ceased.

corpus callosum the broad band of nervous tissue that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, containing an estimated 300 million fibres. See cerebrum.

corpus cavernosum either of a pair of cylindrical blood sinuses that form the erectile tissue of the *penis and clitoris. In the penis a third sinus, the corpus spongiosum, encloses the urethra and extends into the glans. All these sinuses have a spongelike structure that allows them to expand when filled with blood.

corpuscle n. any small particle, cell, or mass of tissue.

corpus luteum the glandular tissue in the ovary that forms at the site of a ruptured *Graafian follicle after ovulation. It secretes the hormone *progesterone, which prepares the uterus for implantation. If implantation fails the corpus luteum becomes inactive and degenerates. If an embryo becomes implanted the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone until the fourth month of pregnancy, by which time the placenta has taken over this function.

corpus spongiosum the blood sinus that surrounds the urethra of the male. Together with the corpora cavernosa, it forms the erectile tissue of the *penis. It is expanded at the base of the penis to form the urethral bulb and at the tip to form the glans penis.

corpus striatum the part of the *basal ganglia in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain consisting of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus.

correlation n. (in statistics) the degree of linear relationship between two or more *variables. Pairs of observations can be plotted as a series of points on a graph. The correlation coefficient measures the extent to which the points on the resulting scatter diagram form a straight line. The correlation coefficient varies within the range of +1 (where an increase of one variable is associated with a corresponding increase in the other, and vice versa) to −1 (where an increase of one variable is associated with a corresponding decrease of the other); a coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables. The statistical technique known as multivariate analysis can be used to investigate the relationships between several variables.

Corrigan’s pulse (collapsing pulse) a type of pulse that has an exaggerated rise followed by a sudden fall. It is typical of *aortic regurgitation. [Sir D. J. Corrigan (1802–80), Irish physician]

cortical evoked response audiometry (CERA) an objective test of hearing that measures the electrical activity in the *cerebral cortex following sound stimulation.

cortical Lewy body disease a disorder characterized by a combination of *parkinsonism and *dementia, which typically fluctuates. Visual hallucinations are common, and there is exquisite sensitivity to phenothiazine drugs. Abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies are found within the nerve cells of the cortex and the basal ganglia. It is the third most common cause of dementia (dementia with Lewy bodies) after *Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.

corticosteroid (corticoid) n. any steroid hormone synthesized by the adrenal cortex. There are two main groups of corticosteroids. The glucocorticoids (e.g. *cortisol, *cortisone, and corticosterone) are essential for the utilization of carbohydrate, fat, and protein by the body and for a normal response to stress. Naturally occurring and synthetic glucocorticoids have very powerful anti-inflammatory effects and are used to treat conditions that involve inflammation. The mineralocorticoids (e.g. *aldosterone) are necessary for the regulation of salt and water balance.

corticosterone n. a steroid hormone (see corticosteroid) synthesized and released in small amounts by the adrenal cortex.

corticotrophin n. see ACTH.

corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) a peptide hypothalamic hormone (of 41 amino acids) stimulating the release of *ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) from the anterior pituitary. Its own release is suppressed by a *negative feedback loop involving cortisol, and its action is increased by antidiuretic hormone (see vasopressin) and *angiotensin II. It can be administered intravenously as part of the CRH test, during which blood is analysed at 15-minute intervals for one hour for the ACTH response, which is excessive in cases of primary adrenal failure and suppressed in cases of anterior *hypopituitarism.

cortisol n. a steroid hormone: the major glucocorticoid synthesized and released by the human adrenal cortex (see corticosteroid). It is important for normal carbohydrate metabolism and for the normal response to any stress. See also hydrocortisone.

cortisone n. a naturally occurring *corticosteroid that is used mainly to treat deficiency of corticosteroid hormones in *Addison’s disease and following surgical removal of the adrenal glands. It is administered by mouth or injection and may cause serious side-effects such as stomach ulcers and bleeding, nervous and hormone disturbances, muscle and bone damage, and eye changes.

cor triloculare a rare congenital condition in which there are three instead of four chambers of the heart due to the presence of a single common ventricle. *Cyanosis (blueness) is common. Most patients die in infancy.

Corynebacterium n. a genus of Gram-positive, mostly aerobic, nonmotile rodlike bacteria that frequently bear club-shaped swellings. Many species cause disease in humans, domestic animals, birds, and plants; some are found in dairy products. The species C. diphtheriae (Klebs–Loeffler bacillus) is the causative organism of *diphtheria, producing a powerful *exotoxin that is harmful to heart and nerve tissue. It occurs in one of three forms: gravis, intermedius, and mitis.

coryza (cold in the head) n. a catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose due to either a *cold or *hay fever.See also catarrh.

COSHH (control of substances hazardous to health) (in occupational health) legislation and resulting regulations concerning the duties and responsibilities of employers and employees to ensure that hazardous substances used in a workplace (e.g. toxic chemicals in factories, anaesthetic gases in operating theatres) do not affect adversely the workforce or others.

cost- (costo-) combining form denoting the ribs. Example: costectomy (excision of).

costal adj. of or relating to the ribs.

costal cartilage a cartilage that connects a *rib to the breastbone (*sternum). The first seven ribs (true ribs) are directly connected to the sternum by individual costal cartilages. The next three ribs are indirectly connected to the sternum by three costal cartilages, each of which is connected to the one immediately above it.

costalgia n. pain localized to the ribs. This term is now rarely used.

cost–benefit analysis an analytical process for weighing up the possible losses (costs) and gains (benefits) of an action or policy, often in monetary or numerical form, and usually as a means of deciding between alternatives. In medicine, it is particularly associated with the setting of priorities in allocating limited health-care resources. Analysis may result in a cost–benefit ratio. Compare risk–benefit analysis. See also consequentialism; quality of life; rationing.

costochondritis n. a painful condition of the chest wall, caused by inflammation in the joints between ribs and cartilage, breastbone and cartilage, or breastbone and clavicles. It can be caused by strenuous or repetitive movements. The condition is usually shortlived and resolves without treatment. Compare Tietze’s syndrome.

co-trimoxazole n. an antibacterial drug consisting of sulfamethoxazole (a *sulphonamide) and *trimethoprim, each of which potentiates (increases) the action of the other. Because of the severity of its side-effects, which are those of the sulphonamides, co-trimoxazole is now usually limited to treating *Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and nocardiasis.

cotton-wool spots soft fluffy spots in the retina resulting from accumulations of *axoplasm in the nerve-fibre layer of the retina. These may indicate diseases causing hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) in the nerve-fibre layer (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, connective-tissue disease, or AIDS).

cotyloid cavity see acetabulum.

couching n. an operation for cataract in which the lens is pushed out of the pupil downwards and backwards into the jelly-like vitreous humour by a small knife inserted through the edge of the cornea. It was widely employed in ancient Hindu civilizations but developments in surgery and anaesthesia leave little place for it today.

coughing n. a form of violent exhalation by which irritant particles in the airways can be expelled. Stimulation of the cough reflexes results in the glottis being kept closed until a high expiratory pressure has built up, which is then suddenly released. Medical name: tussis.

cough suppressant see antitussive.

coulomb n. the *SI unit of electric charge, equal to the quantity of electricity transferred by 1 ampere in 1 second. Symbol: C.

counselling n. 1. a method of approaching psychological difficulties in adjustment that aims to help the client work out his own problems. The counsellor listens sympathetically, attempting to identify with the client, tries to clarify current problems, and sometimes gives advice. It involves less emphasis on insight and interpretation than does psychotherapy or psychoanalytic therapy. See also client-centred therapy. 2. see genetic counselling.

counterextension n. *traction on one part of a limb, while the remainder of the limb is held steady: used particularly in the treatment of a fractured femur (thigh bone).

counterirritant n. an agent, such as methyl salicylate, that causes irritation when applied to the skin and is used in order to relieve more deep-seated pain or discomfort. —counterirritation n.

countertraction n. the use of an opposing force to balance that being applied during *traction, when a strong continuous pull is applied, for example, to a limb so that broken bones can be kept in alignment during healing.

coupling agents items that help to improve contact between the two paddles of a manual *defibrillator and the chest wall of the patient, thus reducing the *transthoracic impedance and the risk of contact burns. The most common agents are defibrillation gel pads, thin pads of electrically conductive material placed between the patient’s skin and the defibrillation paddles. The two pads must not touch during defibrillation or a short circuit will form between the paddles. Liquid gels can also be used, but there is a greater risk of short-circuiting as the gel can spread between the two paddles.

couvelaire n. the appearance of the uterus following a massive placental abruption (*abruptio placentae) when blood has extravasated (leaked) through the *myometrium to the subserosal surface of the uterus. The uterus is hard and tender and a bruised discoloration can be seen at the time of Caesarean section.

covariate (covariable) n. (in statistics) a continuous *variable that is not part of the main experimental manipulation but has a statistical relationship with the dependent variable. For example, in a study of weight gain, age may be a significant covariate. The inclusion of covariates increases the power of the statistical test and minimizes the effect of *confounding variables.

cover-slip n. an extremely thin square or circle of glass used to protect the upper surface of a preparation on a microscope slide.

cover test a test used to detect a squint. The observer looks at a target object, one eye at a time being covered. If the uncovered eye deviates to focus on the target, then a squint is confirmed. The movement can be up, down, sideways, or a combination, depending on the type of squint (see strabismus).

Cowper’s glands (bulbourethral glands) a pair of small glands that open into the urethra at the base of the penis. Their secretion contributes to the seminal fluid, but less than that of the prostate gland or seminal vesicles. [W. Cowper (1660–1709), English surgeon]

cowpox n. a virus infection of cows’ udders, transmitted to humans by direct contact, causing very mild symptoms similar to *smallpox. An attack confers immunity to smallpox. Medical name: vaccinia.

cox- (coxo-) combining form denoting the hip. Example: coxalgia (pain in).

coxa n. (pl. coxae) 1. the hip bone. 2. the hip joint.

Coxiella n. a genus of rickettsiae that cause disease in animals and humans. They are transmitted to humans by inhalation and produce disease characterized by inflammation of the lungs, without a rash (compare typhus). The single species, C. burnetii, causes *Q fever.

COX-2 inhibitor any one of a group of anti-inflammatory drugs (see NSAID) that selectively block the action of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), which mediates the production of *prostaglandin at sites of inflammation, especially in joints; they are less likely to inhibit COX-1, which controls the production of prostaglandin in the stomach (where it is involved in the production of protective mucus), and therefore less likely than nonselective NSAIDs to cause peptic bleeding or ulceration. COX-2 inhibitors are used in the treatment of arthritis, acute gout, and moderate or severe pain. They include *celecoxib and etoricoxib. However, because their use is associated with an increased incidence of heart attack and stroke, COX-2 inhibitors should be taken only by those who are not at risk of developing these conditions and who have a high risk of developing peptic ulceration. Other side-effects include fluid retention (oedema), intestinal upset, dizziness, insomnia, and sore throat.

Cox maze procedure a cardiac surgical procedure performed to prevent atrial *fibrillation. Multiple atrial incisions are made in a mazelike pattern. These incisions heal with scar tissue that does not conduct electricity, thus interrupting the abnormal electrical impulses that trigger atrial fibrillation. [J. Cox (21st century), US surgeon]

Coxsackie virus (echovirus) one of a group of RNA-containing viruses that are able to multiply in the gastrointestinal tract (see enterovirus). About 30 different types exist. Type A Coxsackie viruses generally cause less severe and less well-defined diseases, such as *hand, foot, and mouth disease, although some cause meningitis and severe throat infections (see herpangina). Type B Coxsackie viruses cause inflammation or degeneration of heart tissue, resulting in pericarditis or myocarditis, or brain tissue, producing meningitis or encephalitis. They can also attack the muscles of the chest wall, the bronchi, pancreas, thyroid, or conjunctiva and recent evidence suggests they may be implicated in diabetes in children and in motor neuron disease. See also Bornholm disease.

CPAP see continuous positive airways pressure.

C-peptide n. a peptide (so-called because of its C shape) formed when insulin is produced from its precursor molecule, proinsulin. It is secreted in equal molar amounts to insulin. However, as it remains detectable in the plasma much longer than insulin it can be more easily assayed as a marker of the degree of insulin secretion. This can be useful to assess the ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin, for example when trying to determine whether somebody has type 1 or type 2 diabetes or to distinguish an insulin-secreting tumour (an *insulinoma) from surreptitious insulin usage in somebody presenting with unexplained hypoglycaemia.

CPR see cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

CQC see Care Quality Commission.

crab louse see Phthirus.

cradle n. a framework of metal strips or other material that forms a cage over an injured part of the body of a patient lying in bed, to protect it from the pressure of the bedclothes.

cradle cap a common condition in young babies in which crusty white or yellow scales form a ‘cap’ on the scalp. It is treated by applying oil or using a special shampoo and usually resolves in the first year of life, although it may represent the start of seborrhoeic *eczema.

CRAFFT screening test a screening tool for young people under the age of 21 to identify alcohol and drug use. The first part consists of three questions about drug or alcohol use over the past year. Participants giving positive answers to two or more questions proceed to the second part (from which the name derives), which contains six questions with the key words car, relax, alone, family/friends, forget, trouble, used to assess the need for further input.

cramp n. prolonged painful contraction of a muscle. It is sometimes caused by an imbalance of calcium and potassium in the body, but is more often a result of fatigue, imperfect posture, or stress. Spasm in the muscles making it impossible to perform a specific task but allowing the use of these muscles for any other movement is called occupational cramp. It most often affects the hand muscles for writing (writer’s cramp), a form of *dystonia.

crani- (cranio-) combining form denoting the skull. Example: cranioplasty (plastic surgery of).

cranial nerves the 12 pairs of nerves that arise directly from the brain and leave the skull through separate apertures; they are conventionally given Roman numbers, as follows: I *olfactory; II *optic; III *oculomotor; IV *trochlear; V *trigeminal; VI *abducens; VII *facial; VIII *vestibulocochlear; IX *glossopharyngeal; X *vagus; XI *accessory; XII *hypoglossal. Compare spinal nerves.

craniopagus (dicephalus) n. *conjoined twins united by their heads.

craniopharyngioma n. a brain tumour, situated above the *sella turcica, that is derived from remnants of Rathke’s pouch, the earliest detectable embryonic precursor of the pituitary gland. The patient may show raised intracranial pressure and *diabetes insipidus due to reduced secretion of the hormone *vasopressin. An X-ray of the skull typically shows calcification within the tumour and loss of the normal skull structure around the pituitary gland.

craniostenosis n. premature closing of the *sutures and fontanelles between the cranial bones during development, resulting in the skull remaining abnormally small. Compare craniosynostosis.

craniosynostosis n. premature fusion of some of the cranial bones, usually before birth, so that the skull is unable to expand in certain directions to assume its normal shape under the influence of the growing brain. Depending on which cranial *sutures fuse early, the skull may become elongated from front to back, broad and short, peaked (oxycephaly or turricephaly), or asymmetrical. Craniosynostosis is a feature of several related inherited disorders (see acrocephalosyndactyly). Compare craniostenosis.

craniotomy n. 1. surgical removal of a portion of the skull (cranium), performed to expose the brain and *meninges for inspection or biopsy or to relieve excessive intracranial pressure (as in a subdural *haematoma). 2. surgical perforation of the skull of a dead fetus during difficult labour, so that delivery may continue. For both operations the instrument used is called a craniotome.

cranium n. the part of the skeleton that encloses the brain. It consists of eight bones connected together by immovable joints (see skull). —cranial adj.

C-reactive protein (CRP) a protein whose plasma concentrations are raised in infections and inflammatory states and in the presence of tissue damage or necrosis.

cream n. a preparation for use on the skin consisting of an emulsion of oil in water, which may or may not contain medication. It rubs into the skin easily and contains preservatives, which may be allergenic. Compare ointment.

creatinase (creatine kinase) n. an enzyme involved in the metabolic breakdown of creatine to creatinine.

creatine n. a product of protein metabolism found in muscle. Its phosphate, creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine, phosphagen), acts as a store of high-energy phosphate in muscle and serves to maintain adequate amounts of *ATP (the source of energy for muscular contraction).

creatine kinase an enzyme involved in the metabolic breakdown of creatine to creatinine. Isomers of creatine kinase originate from brain and thyroid (BB), skeletal muscle (MM), and cardiac muscle (MB). Any damage to these tissues causes an increase of the isomer in the serum, which can be used in diagnosis, particularly of myocardial infarction.

creatinine n. a substance derived from creatine and creatine phosphate in muscle. Creatinine is excreted in the urine.

creatinuria n. an excess of the nitrogenous compound creatine in the urine.

creeping eruption (larva migrans) a skin disease caused either by larvae of certain nematode worms (e.g. Ancylostoma braziliense) normally parasitic in dogs and cats or by the maggots of certain flies (see Hypoderma; Gasterophilus). The larvae burrow within the skin tissues, their movements marked by long thin red lines that cause the patient intense irritation. The nematode infections are treated with albendazole, ivermectin, or tiabendazole; maggots can be surgically removed.

cremasteric reflex a superficial reflex in males elicited by stroking the inner side of the upper thigh with a sharp object. If the reflex is intact the scrotum on that side is pulled upwards as the cremaster muscle contracts. Absence or reduction of both cremasteric reflexes indicates an upper *motor neuron lesion; absence of the reflex on one side suggests a lower motor neuron lesion at the level of the first lumbar spinal nerve.

crenation n. an abnormal appearance of red blood cells seen under a microscope, in which the normally smooth cell margins appear crinkly or irregular. Crenation may be a feature of certain blood disorders, but most commonly occurs as a result of prolonged storage of a blood specimen prior to preparation of a blood film. See also burr cell.

Creon n. see pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

crepitation (rale) n. a soft fine crackling sound heard in the lungs through the stethoscope. Crepitations are made either by air passages and alveoli (air sacs) opening up during inspiration or by air bubbling through fluid. They are not normally heard in healthy lungs.

crepitus n. 1. a crackling sound or grating feeling produced by bone rubbing on bone or roughened cartilage, detected by palpation on movement of an arthritic joint. Crepitus in the knee joint is a common sign of *chondromalacia patellae in the young and *osteoarthritis in the elderly. 2. a similar sound heard with a stethoscope over an inflamed lung when the patient breathes in. 3. a similar sound heard over an inflamed extensor tendon in the hand in *scleroderma caused by thickening of the skin, or over a tendon injured by repetitive use in de Quervain’s *tendovaginitis.

crest n. a ridge or linear protuberance, particularly on a bone. Examples include the crest of fibula and the iliac crest (of the ilium).

CREST syndrome a disease characterized by the association of *calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon (see Raynaud’s disease), (o)esophageal malfunction, sclerodactyly (tapering fingers), and *telangiectasia (see telangiectasis). It represents a variant of *systemic sclerosis and is also called limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. It may be associated with severe pulmonary hypertension.

cretinism n. a syndrome of *dwarfism, learning disabilities, and coarseness of the skin and facial features due to lack of thyroid hormone from birth (congenital *hypothyroidism).

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) a rapidly progressive rare neurological disease, a form of human *spongiform encephalopathy in which dementia progresses to death after a period of 3–12 months. There is no effective treatment. The causative agent is an abnormal *prion protein that accumulates in the brain and causes widespread destruction of tissue. CJD typically affects middle-aged to elderly people. Some 15% of cases are due to a form of the disease that is inherited as an autosomal *dominant trait but most cases are sporadic, susceptibility being genetically determined. A few cases of CJD are acquired: the agent is known to have been transmitted by tissue and organ transplantation and by human growth hormone injections, but the disease may take years to manifest itself. Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) is the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is most likely acquired by the ingestion of infected beef products. Patients are younger than those affected with sporadic CJD and present with psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety) and hypersensitivity to touch, which are followed after months by myoclonic jerks (see myoclonus) and dementia. [H. G. Creutzfeldt (1885–1964) and A. M. Jakob (1884–1931), German psychiatrists]

CRH see corticotrophin-releasing hormone.

cribriform plate see ethmoid bone.

cricoid cartilage the cartilage, shaped like a signet ring, that forms part of the anterior and lateral walls and most of the posterior wall of the *larynx.

cricoid pressure a technique in which a trained assistant presses downwards on the *cricoid cartilage of a supine patient to aid endotracheal *intubation.

cricothyroid membrane the fibrous tissue in the anterior aspect of the neck between the lower border of the *thyroid cartilage (the ‘Adam’s apple’) and the upper border of the *cricoid cartilage, lying immediately below it. It is the site where certain emergency airway devices can be inserted.

cricothyroidotomy n. a technique for obtaining an emergency airway through the *cricothyroid membrane when standard airway techniques have failed. There are two main techniques. In needle cricothyroidotomy, a large-bore intravenous cannula is inserted directly through the membrane. Ventilation by this technique can only be through a high-pressure system, must only be performed by trained personnel, and must only continue for a maximum of 45 minutes. Damage to the lungs can ensue. In surgical cricothyroidotomy, a surgical hole is made in the membrane and a cuffed tube, similar to a short endotracheal tube (see intubation), is inserted directly. This affords much better airway protection.

cri-du-chat syndrome a congenital condition of severe learning disabilities associated with an abnormal facial appearance, spasticity, and a characteristic catlike cry in infancy. It results from a chromosomal abnormality in which there is a loss (*deletion) of part of the short arm of chromosome no. 5.

Crigler–Najjar syndrome a rare genetic disease in which the liver enzyme glucuronyl transferase, responsible for dealing with bilirubin, is absent. A large amount of unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in the blood leading to refractory jaundice in early childhood. The definitive treatment is a liver transplant; if left untreated, life expectancy is usually less than two years. [J. F. Crigler and V. A. Najjar (20th century), US paediatricians]

Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever a disease caused by bunyaviruses that has occurred in the former USSR, the Middle East, and Africa. It causes bleeding into the intestines, kidneys, genitals, and mouth with up to 50% mortality. The virus is spread by various types of tick from wild animals and birds to domestic animals (especially goats and cattle) and thus to humans.

crisantaspase n. see asparaginase.

Crohn’s disease a condition in which segments of the gastrointestinal tract become inflamed, thickened, ulcerated, and scarred. It can affect any part of the tract from mouth to anus; common areas affected are the small bowel and colon. It commonly affects the terminal ileum and may mimic acute *appendicitis. The main symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tiredness, and loss of weight. Longstanding poorly controlled Crohn’s disease may predispose to *malabsorption, strictures, and intestinal obstruction. *Fistulae around the anus, between adjacent loops of intestine, or from intestine to skin, bladder, etc., may complicate Crohn’s disease. The cause is unknown, but various environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved.

It may be made of porcelain (sometimes bonded to a metal substructure), gold, a combination of these, or less commonly other materials. Most crowns are like thimbles and are custom made to fit over a trimmed-down tooth. Preformed metal crowns may be used on primary teeth. A post crown is used to restore a tooth when insufficient of the natural crown remains. A post is inserted into the root and the missing centre of the tooth is built up as a core; over it is fitted a thimble-like crown to restore the natural shape of the tooth. *Root canal treatment is required before a post crown can be made.

crude rate the total number of events (e.g. cases of lung cancer) expressed as a rate per 1000 population. When factors such as age structure or sex of populations can significantly affect the rates (as in *mortality or *morbidity rates) it is more meaningful to compare age/sex specific rates using one or more age groups of a designated sex (e.g. lung cancer in males aged 55–64 years). More complex calculations, which take account of the age and sex structure of a population as a whole, can produce *standardized rates and *standardized mortality ratios (SMR).

cruising n. (in child development) taking steps while holding onto furniture for support. At first, the toddler probably faces the furniture and shuffles sideways. Cruising usually begins in the 9th month, but can begin as early as 7 months and as late as 12 months. Babies generally progress from sitting to crawling to supported standing to cruising. Regardless of developmental order, cruising always comes after supported standing and before unsupported walking.

The technique is mostly used to destroy abnormal conducting tissue in the heart, especially abnormal cells around the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium in patients with atrial *fibrillation. However, it is also used for kidney, prostate, and bone tumours. *Radiofrequency ablation is an alternative approach.

cryoglobulin n. an abnormal protein – an *immunoglobulin (see paraprotein) – that may be present in the blood in certain diseases. Cryoglobulins become insoluble at low temperatures, leading to obstruction of small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in cold weather and producing a characteristic rash. The presence of cryoglobulins (cryoglobulinaemia) may be a feature of a variety of diseases, including *macroglobulinaemia, systemic *lupus erythematosus, and certain infections.

cryoprecipitate n. a precipitate produced by freezing and thawing under controlled conditions. An example of a cryoprecipitate is the residue obtained from fresh frozen blood plasma that has been thawed at 4°C.

Cryosurgery is commonly used for the treatment of retinal detachment (see cryoretinopexy), the destruction of certain bone tumours, and the obliteration of skin blemishes.

cryotherapy n. the destruction of diseased or unwanted tissue based on freezing. For example, prostate cryotherapy involves two alternate freeze-thaw cycles using specialized needles introduced into the prostate through the perineum to destroy cancer cells, either after failed radiotherapy or as a primary treatment. Freezing is performed by the infusion of argon gas through the needles and thawing by the infusion of helium. See also cyclocryotherapy; cryosurgery; hypothermia.

cryptophthalmos n. apparent absence of the eyes due to failure of normal eyelid formation during embryonic development, resulting in absence of the opening between the upper and lower eyelids.

cryptorchidism (cryptorchism) n. the condition in which the testes fail to descend into the scrotum and are retained within the abdomen or inguinal canal. The operation of *orchidopexy is necessary to bring the testes into the scrotum, ideally before the age of two years, in order to allow subsequent normal development; it is thought that the higher temperature in the abdomen interferes with sperm production. —cryptorchid adj., n.

cryptosporidiosis n. an intestinal infection of mammals and birds caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium, which is usually transmitted to humans via farm animals. Ingestion of water or milk contaminated with infective oocysts results in severe diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, caused by release of a toxin. Most patients recover in 7–14 days, but the disease can persist in the immunocompromised (including AIDS patients), the elderly, and young children.

cupola n. 1. the small dome at the end of the cochlea. 2. any of several dome-shaped anatomical structures.

cupping n. the traditional Chinese practice of applying a heated cup to the skin and allowing it to cool, which causes swelling of the tissues beneath and an increase in the flow of blood in the area. This is thought to draw out harmful excess blood from diseased organs nearby and so promote healing. In wet cupping the skin is previously cut, so that blood will flow into the cup and can be removed.

cupula n. a small dome-shaped structure consisting of sensory hairs embedded in gelatinous material, forming part of a *crista in the ampullae of the semicircular canals of the ear.

cupulolith n. a particle derived from *otoliths in the *utricle of the inner ear, displaced from its normal site and attached to the *cupula within the ampullary portion of one of the semicircular canals. Cupuloliths are implicated in *benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

Used for centuries as an arrow poison by South American Indians, curare was formerly employed to control the muscle spasms of tetanus and as a muscle relaxant in surgical operations.

curettage n. the scraping of the skin or the internal surface of an organ or body cavity by means of a spoon-shaped instrument (curette), usually to remove diseased tissue or to obtain a specimen for diagnostic purposes (see also dilatation and curettage). Curettage of the skin is combined with cauterization; it may be used for the removal of *basal cell carcinoma, seborrhoeic *keratoses, etc., and usually causes little scarring.

curette n. a spoon-shaped instrument for scraping tissue from a cavity (see curettage; dilatation and curettage).

Symptoms include weight gain, reddening of the face and neck, excess growth of body and facial hair, raised blood pressure, loss of mineral from the bones (osteoporosis), raised blood glucose levels, and sometimes mental disturbances. The syndrome may be due to overstimulation of the adrenal glands by excessive amounts of the hormone ACTH, secreted either by a tumour of the pituitary gland (Cushing’s disease) or by a malignant tumour in the lung or elsewhere. Other causes include a benign or malignant tumour of the adrenal gland(s), resulting in excess activity of the gland, and prolonged therapy with high doses of corticosteroid drugs. [H. W. Cushing (1869–1939), US surgeon]

Cushing’s ulcers see stress ulcers. [H. W. Cushing]

cusp n. 1. any of the cone-shaped prominences on teeth, especially the molars and premolars. 2. a pocket or fold of the membrane (endocardium) lining the heart or of the layer of the wall of a vein, several of which form a *valve. When the blood flows backwards the cusps fill up and become distended, so closing the valve.

cyan- (cyano-) combining form denoting blue.

cyanide n. any of the notoriously poisonous salts of hydrocyanic acid. Cyanides combine with and render inactive the enzymes of the tissues responsible for cellular respiration, and therefore they kill extremely quickly; unconsciousness is followed by convulsions and death. Hydrogen cyanide vapour is fatal in less than a minute when inhaled. Sodium or potassium cyanide taken by mouth may also kill within minutes. Prompt treatment with sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulphate or dicobalt *edetate may save life. Cyanides give off a smell of bitter almonds.

cyanocobalamin n. see vitamin B12.

cyanopsia n. a condition in which everything looks bluish.

Common side-effects are nausea, vomiting, and – particularly at high doses – hair loss. See also mesna.

cyclophotoablation n. the use of light or lasers to destroy the *ciliary body of the eye in order to reduce production of aqueous humour and hence reduce intraocular pressure. It is used in the treatment of glaucoma.

cycloplegia n. paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye (see ciliary body). This causes inability to alter the focus of the eye and is usually accompanied by paralysis of the muscles of the iris, resulting in fixed dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). It is induced by the use of atropine or similar drugs in order to inactivate the muscle in cases of inflammation of the iris and ciliary body and to objectively assess the refractive status of the eye, particularly in children. It may also occur after injuries to the eye.

cycloserine n. an *antibiotic, active against a wide range of bacteria, that may be used as supporting treatment in resistant tuberculosis. Side-effects, which can be severe, include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, convulsions, and mental confusion.

Because of a risk of liver damage, liver function tests should be carried out before and during treatment.

cyrtometer n. a device for measuring the shape of the chest and its movements during breathing.

cyst n. 1. an abnormal sac or closed cavity lined with *epithelium and filled with liquid or semisolid matter. There are many varieties of cysts occurring in different parts of the body. Retention cysts arise when the outlet of a glandular duct is blocked, as in *sebaceous cysts. Some cysts are congenital, due to abnormal embryonic development; for example, *dermoid cysts. Others are tumours containing cells that secrete mucus or other substances, and another type of cyst is formed by parasites in the body (see hydatid). Cysts may occur in the jaws: a periapical cyst occurs at the apex of a tooth, a dentigerous cyst occurs around the crown of an unerupted tooth, and an eruption cyst forms over an erupting tooth. See also fimbrial cyst; ovarian cyst; pseudocyst. 2. a dormant stage produced during the life cycle of certain protozoan parasites of the alimentary canal, including *Giardia and *Entamoeba.

The ureters draining the urine from the kidneys are reimplanted into an isolated segment of intestine (usually the ileum), which is brought to the skin surface as a spout (see ileal conduit). Alternatively, in bladder replacement, a segment of ileum or colon is reconstructed to form a pouch (the Studer pouch is created from approximately 50 cm of ileum), which is anastomosed to the urethra and acts as a reservoir for the urine. Emptying may be achieved by abdominal straining or *intermittent self-catheterization.

cysteine n. a sulphur-containing *amino acid that is an important constituent of many enzymes. The disulphide (S–S) links between adjacent cysteine molecules in polypeptide chains contribute to the three-dimensional molecular structure of proteins.

cystic adj. 1. of, relating to, or characterized by cysts. 2. of or relating to the gall bladder or urinary bladder.

cystic duct see bile duct.

cysticercosis n. a disease caused by the presence of tapeworm larvae (see cysticercus) of the species *Taenia solium in any of the body tissues. Humans become infected on ingesting tapeworm eggs in contaminated food or drink. The presence of cysticerci in the muscles causes pain and weakness; in the brain the symptoms are more serious, including mental deterioration, paralysis, giddiness, epileptic attacks, and convulsions, which may be fatal. There is no specific treatment for this cosmopolitan disease although surgical removal of cysticerci may be necessary to relieve pressure on the brain.

cysticercus (bladderworm) n. a larval stage of some *tapeworms in which the scolex and neck are invaginated into a large fluid-filled cyst. The cysts develop in the muscles or brain of the host following ingestion of tapeworm eggs. See cysticercosis.

cystic fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas, mucoviscidosis) a hereditary disease affecting cells of the exocrine glands (including mucus-secreting glands, sweat glands, and others). The faulty gene responsible for the most common form of the disease has been identified as lying on chromosome no. 7 and is recessive, i.e. both parents of the patient can be *carriers without being affected by the disease. Affected individuals have abnormalities in a protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), that enables the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes: this results in the production of thick mucus, which obstructs the intestinal glands (causing meconium *ileus in newborn babies), pancreas (causing deficiency of pancreatic enzymes resulting in *malabsorption and *failure to thrive), and bronchi (causing *bronchiectasis). Respiratory infections, which may be severe, are a common complication. Common agents include *Haemophilus, *Pseudomonas, *Staphylococcus, and Burkholderia cepacia. The sweat contains excessive amounts of sodium and chloride, which is an aid to diagnosis.

Treatment consists of minimizing the effects of the disease by administration of pancreatic enzymes and physiotherapy for the lungs and by preventing and combating secondary infection. Sputum viscosity can be reduced by nebulized recombinant human *DNAse. *Genetic counselling is essential, as each subsequent child of carrier parents has a one in four chance of being affected (see also mouthwash test; preimplantation genetic diagnosis). Some patients are benefiting from revolutionary new treatments, including transplantation of heart and lungs and treatment aimed at altering the genetic content of the faulty cells (see gene therapy).

cystitis n. inflammation of the urinary bladder, often caused by infection (most commonly by the bacterium Escherichia coli). It is usually accompanied by the desire to pass urine frequently, with a degree of burning. More severe attacks are often associated with the painful passage of blood in the urine, which is accompanied by a cramplike pain in the lower abdomen persisting after the bladder has been emptied. An acute attack is treated by antibiotic administration and a copious fluid intake. See also interstitial cystitis.

Cystography is most commonly performed to detect reflux of urine from the bladder to the ureters, usually in children (see vesicoureteric reflux). In adults it is often performed to detect bladder injury or perforation. If films are taken during voiding (micturating cystourethrogram) then the urethra can also be observed (see urethrography). The examination can also be performed in conjunction with manometry (see bladder pressure study).

cystoid macular oedema swelling of the central area of the retina (macula), usually occurring as a result of trauma, posterior *uveitis, or ocular surgery.

cystolithiasis n. the presence of stones (calculi) in the urinary bladder. The stones are either formed in the bladder, due to obstruction, urinary statis, and infection (primary calculi), or pass to the bladder after being formed in the kidneys (secondary calculi). They cause pain, the passage of bloody urine, and interruption of the urinary stream and should be removed surgically. See calculus.

cystometry n. a measurement of the pressure within the bladder to assess filling and voiding phases of urination in a patient with incontinence. Two catheters are placed into the bladder, one for filling the bladder and the other (a cystometer) for recording pressure. Modern investigations also include measurement of urine flow, and the resultant bladder pressure/flow study (urodynamic investigation) provides useful information regarding bladder function.

cystopexy (vesicofixation) n. a surgical operation to fix the urinary bladder (or a portion of it) in a different position. It may be performed as part of the repair or correction of a prolapsed bladder.

cystoplasty n. an operation to enlarge the capacity of and to decrease the pressure within the bladder by incorporating a segment of bowel. In a clam cystoplasty, the bladder is cut across transversely from one side of the neck to the other side through the dome (fundus) of the bladder and a length of the ileum, jejunum, or colon is inserted as a patch. In the operation of ileocaecocystoplasty, the dome is removed by cutting across the bladder transversely or sagittally above the openings of the ureters; it is replaced by an isolated segment of caecum and terminal ileum. In ileocystoplasty the bladder is enlarged by an opened-out portion of small intestine. The bladder may be totally replaced by a reservoir constructed from either small or large intestine (see cystectomy).

cystosarcoma phylloides a malignant tumour of the connective tissue of the breast: it accounts for approximately 1% of all breast cancers. Such tumours may show a wide variation in cell structure and they often present as a large mass but without distant spread. The best treatment for a localized tumour is simple *mastectomy.

cystoscopy n. examination of the bladder by means of an instrument (cystoscope) inserted via the urethra. The cystoscope consists of either a metal sheath surrounding a telescope and light-conducting bundles or a flexible tube with built-in optical fibres for viewing and illumination. Irrigating fluid is conducted through a channel into the bladder. When using the rigid instrument, additional channels are available for the insertion of guidewires, ureteric catheters, diathermy electrodes, or biopsy forceps for taking specimens of tumours or other growths. When using the flexible cystoscope, only small instruments can be passed through the additional channel, such as biopsy forceps, diathermy electrodes, or laser fibres for the destruction of tumours or stones.

cystostomy n. the operation of creating an artificial opening between the bladder and the anterior abdominal wall. This provides a temporary or permanent drainage route for urine.

cystotomy n. surgical incision into the urinary bladder, usually by cutting through the abdominal wall above the pubic symphysis (suprapubic cystotomy). This is necessary for such operations as removing stones or tumours from the bladder and for gaining access to the prostate gland in the operation of transvesical *prostatectomy.

cytokeratin n. a member of a family of proteins – *keratins – found in the cytoplasm of epithelial tissues and the cancers arising in them (*carcinomas). Any given carcinoma has its unique pattern of cytokeratins, which can be identified on histochemical analysis of a specimen and can help in the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma when the primary site of metastasis is unknown.

cytokine inhibitor (cytokine modulator) any one of a group of agents that inhibit the activity of cytokines, especially *tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). They include *infliximab, *etanercept, and *adalimumab, known as anti-TNF drugs, which are used as *disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and to treat inflammatory bowel disease.

cytokines pl. n. protein molecules, released by cells when activated by antigen, that are involved in cell-to-cell communications, acting as enhancing mediators for immune responses through interaction with specific cell-surface receptors on leucocytes. Kinds of cytokines include *interleukins (produced by leucocytes), *lymphokines (produced by lymphocytes), *interferons, and *tumour necrosis factor.

cytokinesis n. division of the cytoplasm of a cell, which occurs at the end of cell division, after division of the nucleus, to form two daughter cells. Compare karyokinesis.

cytology n. the study of the structure and function of cells. The examination of cells under a microscope is used in the diagnosis of various diseases. These cells are obtained by scraping an organ, as in cervical cytology (see cervical smear; liquid-based cytology), by aspiration (see aspiration cytology), or they are collected from cells already shed (exfoliative cytology). See also biopsy. —cytological adj.

cytolysis n. the breakdown of cells, particularly by destruction of their outer membranes.

cytomegalovirus (CMV) n. a member of the herpes group of viruses (see herpesvirus). It commonly occurs in humans and normally produces symptoms milder than the common cold. However, in individuals whose immune systems are compromised (e.g. by cancer or AIDS) it can cause more severe effects (such as *retinitis), and it has been found to be the cause of congenital impairment in infants born to women who have contracted the virus during pregnancy.

cytometer n. an instrument for determining the number of cells in a given quantity of fluid, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine. See haemocytometer.

cytomorphosis n. the changes undergone by a cell in the course of its life cycle.

cytophotometry n. the study of chemical compounds in living cells by means of a cytophotometer, an instrument that measures light intensity through stained areas of cytoplasm.

cytoplasm n. the jelly-like substance that surrounds the nucleus of a cell. See also ectoplasm; endoplasm; protoplasm. —cytoplasmic adj.

cytoplasmic inheritance the inheritance of characters controlled by genes present in the cell cytoplasm rather than by genes on the chromosomes in the cell nucleus. An example of cytoplasmic inheritance is that controlled by mitochondrial genes (see mitochondrion).

cytosine n. one of the nitrogen-containing bases (see pyrimidine) that occurs in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.

cytosome n. the part of a cell that is outside the nucleus.

cytotoxic drug any drug that damages or destroys cells: usually refers to those drugs used to treat various types of cancer. There are various classes of cytotoxic drugs, including *alkylating agents (e.g. *chlorambucil, *cyclophosphamide, *melphalan), *antimetabolites (e.g. *fluorouracil, *methotrexate, *mercaptopurine), *anthracycline antibiotics (e.g. *doxorubicin, *daunorubicin, *dactinomycin), *vinca alkaloids, and platinum compounds (e.g. *carboplatin, *cisplatin). Other cytotoxic drugs include *taxanes and *topoisomerase inhibitors, and some *monoclonal antibodies (e.g. *bevacizumab, *trastuzumab) have cytotoxic activity. All these drugs offer successful treatment in some conditions and help reduce symptoms and prolong life in others. Cytotoxic drugs destroy cancer cells by interfering with cell division, but they also affect normal cells, particularly in bone marrow (causing *myelosuppression), hair follicles (causing hair loss), the stomach lining (resulting in severe nausea and vomiting), mouth (causing soreness), and fetal tissue (they should not be taken during the later stages of pregnancy). Dosage must therefore be carefully controlled. See also chemotherapy.

cytotoxic T cell a type of T *lymphocyte that destroys cancerous cells, virus-infected cells, and *allografts. Cytotoxic T cells recognize peptide antigens attached to proteins that are encoded by the *HLA system.

cytotrophoblast n. see trophoblast.

dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) n. an operation to relieve blockage of the nasolacrimal duct (which drains tears into the nose), in which a communication is made between the lacrimal sac and the nose by removing the intervening bone. It is done via a skin incision (external DCR) or through the nose (endonasal DCR). See dacryocystitis; lacrimal apparatus.

dactinomycin (actinomycin D) n. a *cytotoxic drug (an antibiotic) used mainly to treat cancers in children. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, blood disorders, and bone-marrow damage.

dactylitis n. inflammation of a finger or toe caused by bone infection (as in tuberculous *osteomyelitis) or rheumatic diseases, such as spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, or sarcoidosis or seen in infants with sickle-cell disease. The whole digit is swollen and may resemble a sausage (known as ‘sausage digit’). The diffuse swelling arises from the flexor tendon, its sheath, and adjacent soft tissue.

dactylology n. the representation of speech by finger movements: sign language.

DAFNE (dose adjustment for normal eating) a structured five-day education programme for patients with insulin-dependent *diabetes. It teaches participants to adjust their insulin dosage according to their carbohydrate intake. Outcomes show improved glycaemic control and quality of life.

dalteparin sodium see low-molecular-weight heparin.

Daltonism (protanopia) n. red-blindness: a defect in colour vision in which a person cannot distinguish between reds and greens. The term has been used to refer to *colour blindness in general. [J. Dalton (1766–1844), British chemist]

damp n. (in mining) any gas encountered underground other than air. See blackdamp; firedamp.

danazol n. a synthetic *progestogen that inhibits the secretion by the pituitary gland of gonadotrophins. It is used to treat endometriosis, severe pain associated with cystic breast tumours, and severe urticaria. Possible side-effects include nausea, rashes, swelling of the feet and ankles, weight gain, oiliness of the skin, and, in women, menstrual disturbances, excessive growth of facial and body hair, and irreversible voice changes. Because of the severity of these effects, danazol is now rarely used in gynaecology.

Dance’s sign see sign of Dance.

D and C see dilatation and curettage.

dandruff n. visible scaling from the surface of the scalp. It is extremely common, occurring in about 50% of the population, and is associated with the presence of the yeast Malassezia furfur. It is the precursor of seborrhoeic *eczema of the scalp, in which there is a degree of inflammation in addition to the greasy scaling. Dandruff can be controlled by shampoos containing tar, selenium sulphide, pyrithione zinc, or imidazole antifungals. Medical name: pityriasis capitis.

Dandy–Walker syndrome a form of *cerebral palsy in which the *cerebellum is usually the part of the brain affected. It leads to unsteadiness of balance and an abnormal gait and may be associated with *hydrocephalus. [W. E. Dandy (1886–1946) and A. E. Walker (1907–95), US surgeons]

dangerous drugs see Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

dantrolene n. a *muscle relaxant drug used to relieve spasticity in such conditions as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury.

DAPT see dual antiplatelet therapy.

dark adaptation the changes that take place in the retina and pupil of the eye enabling vision in very dim light. Dark adaptation involves activation of the *rods – the cells of the retina that function best in dim light – and the reflex enlargement of the pupil (see pupillary reflex). Compare light adaptation.

dasatinib n. see tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

data protection legal safeguards relating to the use and storage of personal information about a living person. Under the Data Protection Act 2018, which implements the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and supersedes the Data Protection Act 1998, individuals have a basic right to control information stored about them. Information concerning health, considered ‘sensitive personal data’ under the legislation, must be used only for the purpose (health care of the individual) for which it was gathered, must be kept secret, and cannot be used or passed on to others without the knowledge of the subject. However, anonymized health data from individual patients’ electronic records may be used for research purposes or to improve medical treatment and health-service delivery.

daunorubicin n. an *anthracycline antibiotic that interferes with DNA synthesis and is used in the treatment of acute leukaemias and AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Possible side-effects include loss of hair and damage to bone marrow and heart muscle.

da Vinci robot see prostatectomy.

dawn phenomenon (Somogyi effect) the phenomenon of high fasting blood-sugar levels in the morning due to an unrecognized hypoglycaemic episode during the night in a person with diabetes. The low blood sugar has resulted in an outpouring of regulatory hormones, such as adrenaline and glucagon, which have raised the blood sugar to supranormal levels by the time of waking. It is important to recognize the cause, since increasing the evening insulin dose, thinking this will bring the morning sugars down, could actually cause a more severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic attack, which the body may not be able to counteract: coma might ensue. The condition can be tested for by measuring blood sugars at the time of the assumed low level.

day blindness (hemeralopia) comparatively good vision in poor light but poor vision in good illumination. The condition is usually congenital and associated with poor *visual acuity and defective colour vision. Acquired cases occur when the *cones (light-sensitive cells) are selectively destroyed by disease. Compare night blindness.

day-case surgery surgical procedures that can be performed in a single day, without the need to admit the patient for an overnight stay in hospital. Modern techniques of surgery and anaesthesia now enable many surgical cases of minor and intermediate degrees of severity to be treated in this way: examples include many breast lesions, dilatation and curettage, and operations for hernia and varicose veins. Special units are established in many hospitals.

day hospital a hospital in which patients spend a substantial part of the day under clinical supervision but do not stay overnight. Day hospitals are mainly used for the assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of elderly patients and those with mental disorders. Patients may attend on one or more days during the week.

DBS see deep brain stimulation.

D cells see islets of Langerhans.

DCIS see ductal carcinoma in situ.

DCR see dacryocystorhinostomy.

D-dimer n. a protein measured in a blood test to diagnose thrombosis. Although a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but also has other potential causes. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. This test is now widely used in protocols for the diagnosis of *pulmonary embolism.

DDT (chlorophenothane, dicophane) n. a powerful insecticide that was formerly widely used against lice, fleas, flies, bed bugs, cockroaches, and other disease-carrying and destructive insects. It is a relatively stable compound that is stored in animal fats, and the quantities now present in the environment – in the form of stores accumulated in animal tissues – have led to its use being restricted. Acute poisoning, from swallowing more than 20 g, produces nervous irritability, muscle twitching, convulsions, and coma, but only a few fatalities have been reported.

de- prefix denoting 1. removal or loss. Examples: demineralization (of minerals from bones or teeth); devascularization (of blood supply). 2. reversal.

deafness n. partial or total loss of hearing in one or both ears, now becoming more commonly called hearing loss. Conductive deafness is due to a defect in the conduction of sound from the external ear to the inner ear. This may be due to perforations of the eardrum, fluid or infection in the middle ear (see glue ear; otitis), or disorders of the small bones in the middle ear (*ossicles). Sensorineural (or perceptive) deafness may be due to a lesion of the *cochlea in the inner ear, the cochlear nerve, or the auditory centres in the brain. It may be present from birth (for example if the mother was affected with German measles during pregnancy). In adults it may be brought on by injury, disease (e.g. *Ménière’s disease), or prolonged exposure to loud noise; progressive sensorineural deafness (presbyacusis) is common with advancing age. Some forms of deafness have both conductive and sensorineural components, in which case it is called a mixed hearing loss.

The type of deafness can be diagnosed by various hearing tests (see Rinne’s test; Weber’s test; audiogram), and the treatment depends on the cause. See also cochlear implant; hearing aid; hearing therapy.

deamination n. a process, occurring in the liver, that occurs during the metabolism of amino acids. The amino group (–NH2) is removed from an amino acid and converted to ammonia, which is ultimately converted to *urea and excreted.

death n. absence of vital functions. Death is diagnosed by permanent cessation of the heartbeat. Brain death is defined as permanent functional death of the centres in the brainstem that control breathing, heart rate, and other vital reflexes (including pupillary responses). Many decisions in medicine depend on death being clearly defined and objectively observed. Particular problems arise when a potential organ donor is being kept artificially alive. Legally, two independent medical opinions are required before brain death is agreed and organs can be removed for transplantation. In medical ethics, death is of crucial interest because it elucidates debates about *personhood and prompts consideration of the duties owed to the living and the deceased. Religious perspectives on death may inform the ways in which people perceive the withdrawal of medical treatment and organ donation. See dying.

death certificate a legal document, signed by a doctor, stating (in Part 1) the immediate cause of a person’s death followed by diseases underlying the condition. For example, if the immediate cause of death was a myocardial infarction, the underlying disease might have been ischaemic heart disease or hypertension. Other diseases, which were not directly linked with the immediate cause of death but may have contributed to the patient’s overall condition, are mentioned in Part 2 of the certificate. The document usually states the decedent’s gender and date and place of death; other details, such as occupation, may also be included. The death certificate forms a vital record in most countries throughout the world; without a death certificate, there can be no funeral. For England and Wales, this information is held at the General Register Office, which is now in Southport. In Scotland death certificates are kept at the National Records of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland at the General Register Office for Northern Ireland. Following the case of the serial killer Dr Harold Shipman and the subsequent public enquiry, legislation has introduced greater checks on, and scrutiny of, death certification by doctors.

debridement n. 1. the process of cleaning an open wound by the removal of foreign material and damaged or dead tissue, so that healing may occur without hindrance. 2. (in dentistry) the cleaning of the root canal in *root canal treatment.

dec- (deca-) prefix denoting ten.

decalcification n. loss or removal of calcium salts from a bone or tooth.

decapitation n. removal of the head, usually the head of a dead fetus to enable delivery to take place. This procedure is very rare nowadays, being undertaken only in dire circumstances when the fetal head is too large to pass through the birth canal, the mother’s life is endangered, and Caesarean section impossible.

decapsulation n. see decortication.

decay n. (in bacteriology) the decomposition of organic matter due to microbial action.

deception n. the act of deliberately misleading, misrepresenting, or withholding information. Respect for patient *autonomy and the importance of trust in therapeutic relationships require that doctors should always strive to be honest with patients. The use of deception in research (see intervention study) is ethically highly controversial. See also therapeutic privilege; truth-telling.

decerebrate adj. denoting a neurological state in which the functions of the higher centres of the brain are eliminated. This is brought about in experimental animals by cutting across the brain below the cerebrum, but certain injuries to the brain in humans may cause the same severe neurological signs as occur in a decerebrate animal.

deci- prefix denoting a tenth.

decibel (dB) n. one tenth of a bel: a unit for comparing levels of power (especially sound) on a logarithmic scale. A power source of intensity P has a power level of 10 log10 P/P0 decibels, where P0 is the intensity of a reference source. The decibel is much more widely used than the bel. In humans, the threshold of hearing is 0 dB; a whisper is approximately 30 dB, normal speech 60 dB, a shout 90 dB, and a jet aircraft 120 dB.

decidua n. the modified mucous membrane that lines the wall of the uterus during pregnancy and is shed with the afterbirth at parturition (see endometrium). There are three regions: the decidua capsularis, a thin layer that covers the embryo; the decidua basalis, where the embryo is attached; and the decidua parietalis, which is not in contact with the embryo. —decidual adj.

deciduous teeth see primary teeth.

de Clérambault syndrome see erotomania. [G. G. de Clérambault (1872–1934), French physician]

declive n. an area of the upper surface of the *cerebellum, posterior to the culmen and anterior to the folium of the middle lobe.

decomposition n. the temperature-dependent gradual disintegration of dead organic matter, usually foodstuffs or tissues, by the chemical action of bacteria and/or fungi.

decompression n. 1. the reduction of pressure on an organ or part of the body by surgical intervention. Surgical decompression can be effected at many sites: the pressure of tissues on a nerve may be relieved by incision; raised pressure in the fluid of the brain can be lowered by cutting into the *dura mater; and cardiac compression – the abnormal presence of blood or fluid round the heart – can be cured by cutting the sac (pericardium) enclosing the heart. 2. the gradual reduction of atmospheric pressure for deep-sea divers, who work at artificially high pressures. See compressed air illness.

decompression sickness see compressed air illness.

decongestive therapy an approach that combines many of the different treatments (such as compression and physiotherapy) used to minimize the pain and swelling associated with *lymphoedema following breast surgery and radiotherapy. There are two phases: reduction (which lasts up to 12 weeks) and maintenance (which continues for life).

decontamination n. 1. a combination of processes used to remove adherent proteins, microorganisms, and infectious agents or other contaminants from surgical instruments and the environment so there is no risk or spread of infection or disease. Instruments are sterilized in an autoclave to finish the decontamination process. 2. the reduction or removal of chemical agents from a site following a terrorist attack or industrial accident; this includes decontaminating people who have come into contact with such agents.

decortication n. 1. the removal of the outside layer (cortex) from an organ or structure, such as the kidney. 2. an operation for removing the blood clot and scar tissue that forms after bleeding into the chest cavity (haemothorax). 3. (decapsulation) the surgical removal of a *capsule from an organ; for example, the stripping of the membrane that envelops the kidney or of the inflammatory capsule that encloses a chronic abscess, as in the treatment of *empyema.

decubitus 1. n. the recumbent position. 2. adj. describing a radiograph taken with the patient lying on his or her side and the X-ray beam travelling horizontally. Such films reveal *free gas in the peritoneal cavity following perforation of a hollow organ and *fluid levels in the bowel when it is obstructed. They are commonly used in barium enema examinations. Compare anteroposterior; posteroanterior.

decubitus ulcer see pressure sore.

decussation n. a point at which two or more structures of the body cross to the opposite side. The term is used particularly for the point at which nerve fibres cross over in the central nervous system.

deep brain stimulation (DBS) a surgical treatment involving the implantation of a medical device that sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS in selected brain regions can provide benefits for treatment-resistant movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, tremor, and *dystonia.

deep vein thrombosis (DVT) see phlebothrombosis.

deer fly see Chrysops.

defecation n. a bowel movement in which faeces are evacuated through the rectum and anus. The amount and composition of the food eaten determine to a large degree the bulk of the faeces, and the transit time through the intestinal tract determines the water content. See constipation; diarrhoea.

defence mechanism the means whereby an undesirable impulse or emotion can be avoided or controlled. Defence mechanisms are regarded as normal forms of self-protection; however, used excessively, they can become pathological. Many defence mechanisms have been described, including *repression, *projection, *reaction formation, *sublimation, and *splitting.

defensive medicine health care that becomes distorted by real or exaggerated fear of legal action so that medical decisions are taken with a view to protecting the professional against legal liability. See also negligence.

deferent adj. 1. carrying away from or down from. 2. relating to the vas deferens.

defervescence n. the disappearance of a fever, a process that may occur rapidly or take several days, depending upon the cause and treatment given.

defibrillation n. administration of a controlled electric shock to restore normal heart rhythm in cases of cardiac arrest due to ventricular *fibrillation. The apparatus used is a *defibrillator.

defibrillation gel pads see coupling agents.

defibrillator n. the apparatus used for *defibrillation, which may be internal (see implantable cardiovertor defibrillator) or external. External defibrillators may be fully automated (see automated external defibrillator), semiautomated, or manual and usually deliver the electric current via two defibrillation paddles. They are now all manufactured to deliver a biphasic current waveform (until recently they were all monophasic). The efficacy of the first shock during *cardiac arrest is higher with biphasic systems, which also use less battery power per shock.

defibrination n. the removal of *fibrin, one of the plasma proteins that causes coagulation, from a sample of blood. It is normally done by whisking the blood with a bundle of fine wires, to which the strands of fibrin that form in the blood adhere.

deficiency n. (in genetics) see deletion.

deficiency disease any disease caused by the lack of an essential nutrient in the diet. Such nutrients include *vitamins, minerals, *essential amino acids, and *essential fatty acids.

degarelix n. a *gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer that does not cause an initial increase in testosterone levels. Side-effects include hot flushes and pain at the injection site.

degeneration n. the deterioration and loss of specialized function of the cells of a tissue or organ. The changes may be caused by a defective blood supply or by disease. Degeneration may involve the deposition of calcium salts, fat (see fatty degeneration), or fibrous tissue in the affected organ or tissue. See also infiltration.

deglutition n. see swallowing.

dehiscence n. 1. a splitting open, as of a surgical wound. 2. (in dentistry) loss of alveolar bone from the facial aspect of a tooth that leaves a root-exposing defect, typically oval in shape, extending from the *cemento-enamel junction towards the apex.

dehydration n. 1. loss or deficiency of water in body tissues. The condition may result from inadequate water intake and/or from excessive removal of water from the body; for example, by sweating, vomiting, or diarrhoea. Symptoms include great thirst, nausea, and exhaustion. The condition is treated by drinking plenty of water; severe cases require *oral rehydration therapy or intravenous administration of water and salts (which have been lost with the water). 2. the removal of water from tissue during its preparation for microscopical study, by placing it successively in stronger solutions of ethyl alcohol. Dehydration follows *fixation and precedes *clearing.

dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) n. a weak androgen produced and secreted by the adrenal glands after the stage of adrenal maturation known as *adrenarche. It is produced from 17-hydroxypregnenolone and itself is largely converted to dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and androstenedione. All three of these molecules can cause a degree of mild *androgenization but can also be converted in the circulation to the more potent androgens *testosterone and *dihydrotestosterone.

dehydrogenase n. see oxidoreductase.

déjà vu a vivid psychic experience in which immediately contemporary events seem to be a repetition of previous happenings. It is a symptom of some forms of *epilepsy. See also jamais vu.

delayed suture (delayed primary closure) a technique used in the closure of contaminated wounds and wounds associated with tissue necrosis, such as those produced by missile injuries. The wound is partially closed after it has been cleaned sufficiently to allow adequate healing.

deletion (deficiency) n. (in genetics) a type of mutation involving the loss of DNA. The deletion may be small, affecting only a portion of a single gene, or large, resulting in loss of a part of a chromosome and affecting many genes.

Delhi boil see oriental sore.

deliberate self-harm any attempt at self-injury or self-poisoning, as often occurs in the context of acute stress, personality disorder, depression, and alcoholism. It may or may not involve suicidal intent. Treatment begins with a psychosocial assessment, on the basis of which the patient may be offered various forms of *psychotherapy and occasionally *antipsychotic medication, *lithium, or *SSRIs. If the attempt is serious, immediate treatment may be necessary in a medical ward or (more rarely), if suicidal intent persists, in a psychiatric ward. Patients who do not have a mental disorder should be assessed using the criteria set out in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and, if found to have *capacity, are entitled to consent to or refuse treatment like any other capacitous adult. See also suicide.

delirium n. an acute disorder of the mental processes characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness, responsiveness, and cognitive ability. It may be manifested by delusions, disorientation, hallucinations, or extreme excitement. There are many possible causes, ranging from head injury to hip or other fracture, infection, constipation, dehydration, pain, or drug side-effects. Treatment is by removal of the underlying cause and supportive medical measures.

delirium tremens an acute confusional state often seen as a withdrawal syndrome in chronic alcoholics (see alcoholism) and caused by sudden cessation of drinking alcohol. Features include anxiety, tremor, sweating, and vivid and terrifying visual and sensory hallucinations, often of animals and insects. Without medical treatment severe cases may end fatally.

delivery n. see labour.

dellen pl. n. localized areas of corneal thinning, usually at the limbus (the junction of the cornea with the sclera), due to local dehydration. They may occur after surgery to correct a squint, due to elevated conjunctiva at the limbus causing poor wetting of the adjacent cornea.

deltoid n. a thick triangular muscle that covers the shoulder joint (see illustration). It is responsible for raising the arm away from the side of the body.

The deltoid muscle.





delusion n. a belief that is held with unshakable conviction, cannot be altered by rational argument, and is outside the person’s normal cultural or subcultural belief system. The belief is usually wrong, but can occasionally be true: the abnormal pathology lies in the irrational way in which the person comes to the belief. In mental illness it may be a false belief that the individual is persecuted by others (paranoid delusion; see paranoia), is very powerful (grandiose delusion), is guilty of something they have not actually done, is poor, or is a victim of physical disease. Delusions may be a symptom of *schizophrenia, acute intoxication, *mania, *delirium, or an organic *psychosis. The intensity of the delusional belief may vary over time.

delusional infestation a *monodelusional disorder in which patients believe they or their environment are infested by living or non-living pathogens. These can range from rats in the patient’s house to microspores in the air. Most commonly, patients claim they are infested with insects, worms, parasites, mites, or inanimate threads or fibres, often underneath their skin. Many present the alleged parasite as a specimen for examination. If compliance can be established, most patients respond well to *antipsychotic medication. The term delusional infestation was first introduced by Roland W. Freudenmann and Peter Lepping in 2009, and has gradually superseded the terms delusional parasitosis and Ekbom’s syndrome.

delusional intensity the intensity with which a delusional belief is held. This can vary over time and sometimes shifts quite rapidly. Some factors, such as treatment, may temporarily or permanently reduce the intensity of a delusion, while others may work to reinforce it.

delusional jealousy a *delusional belief that one’s partner is unfaithful when there is no reasonable evidence for this. It often occurs in the context of *alcoholism.

delusional parasitosis see delusional infestation.

delusional perception a *Schneiderian first-rank symptom in which a person believes that a normal percept (product of perception) has a special meaning for him or her. For example, a cloud in the sky may be misinterpreted as meaning that someone has sent that person a message to save the world. While the symptom is particularly indicative of *schizophrenia, it also occurs in other psychoses, including *mania (in which it often has grandiose undertones).

delusion by proxy a delusion in which the patient believes that another person or an animal (usually the patient’s pet) has certain physical symptoms, even though these cannot be objectively verified. The patient with the delusional belief is called the inducer; the person or pet that is allegedly affected is the proxy. Some *monodelusional disorders, such as *delusional infestation, have a prevalence of delusion by proxy of up to 5%. Treatment is usually with *antipsychotics. In some situations it may be necessary to remove the proxy to provide safety from the behaviour associated with the delusion. See also double delusion; folie à deux.

delusion of reference a *delusion in which the patient believes that unsuspicious occurrences refer to him or her in person. Patients may, for example, believe that certain news bulletins have a direct reference to them, that music played on the radio is played for them, or that car licence plates have a meaning relevant to them. Ideas of reference differ from delusions of reference in that insight is retained.

demeclocycline n. a *tetracycline antibiotic that is used to treat infections caused by Chlamydia, rickettsiae, and mycoplasmas. It is also used to treat *syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Common side-effects are nausea, diarrhoea, and symptoms resulting from the growth of organisms not sensitive to the drug.

dementia n. a chronic and progressive deterioration of behaviour and higher intellectual function due to organic brain disease. It is marked by memory disorders, changes in personality, deterioration in personal care, impaired reasoning ability, and disorientation. Dementia is usually a condition of old age, but it can occur in young or middle-aged people. The most common causes are *Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia resulting from the destruction of brain tissue by a series of small strokes, and dementia due to diffuse *cortical Lewy body disease (see also frontotemporal dementia). Also common is mixed dementia, which combines aspects of vascular damage and Alzheimer’s disease. It is important to distinguish these organic conditions from psychological disorders that can cause similar symptoms such as *depression (see pseudodementia).

demi- prefix denoting half.

Demodex n. a genus of harmless parasitic mites, the follicle mites, found in the hair follicles and associated sebaceous glands of the face. They resemble tiny worms, about 0.4 mm in length, and their presence may give rise to dermatitis.

demography n. the study of populations on a national, regional, or local basis in terms of age, sex, and other *variables, including patterns of migration and survival. It is used in *public health medicine to help identify health needs and *risk factors. See also biostatistics.

demulcent n. a soothing agent that protects the mucous membranes and relieves irritation. Demulcents form a protective film and are used in mouth washes, gargles, etc., to soothe irritation or inflammation in the mouth.

demyelination n. damage to the *myelin sheaths surrounding the nerve fibres in the central or peripheral nervous system. This in turn affects the function of the nerve fibres, which the myelin normally supports. Demyelination may be a primary disorder, as in *multiple sclerosis. There may be associated nerve-fibre damage.

denaturation n. the changes in the physical and physiological properties of a protein that are brought about by heat, X-rays, or chemicals. These changes include loss of activity (in the case of enzymes) and loss (or alteration) of antigenicity (in the case of *antigens).

dendrite n. one of the shorter branching processes of the cell body of a *neuron, which makes contact with other neurons at synapses and carries nerve impulses from them into the cell body.

dendritic cell a type of haemopoietic cell with specialized antigen-presenting functions. The head and neck are common sites for dendritic cell pathology. See antigen-presenting cell.

dendritic ulcer a branching ulcer of the surface of the cornea caused by *herpes simplex virus. A similar appearance may be produced by a healing corneal abrasion. Dendritic ulcers tend to recur because the virus lies dormant in the corneal sensory nerves; years may elapse between recurrences.

denervation n. interruption of the nerve supply to the muscles and skin. The muscle is paralysed and its normal tone (elasticity) is lost. The muscle fibres atrophy (shrink) and are replaced by fat. A denervated area of skin loses all forms of sensation and its subsequent ability to heal and renew its tissues may be impaired.

dengue (breakbone fever) n. a disease caused by arboviruses and transmitted to humans principally by the mosquito *Aëdes aegypti. Symptoms, which last for a few days, include severe pains in the joints and muscles, headache, sore throat, fever, running of the eyes, and an irritating rash. These symptoms recur in a usually milder form after an interval of two or three days. Death rarely occurs, but the patient is left debilitated and requires considerable convalescence. A more severe form, dengue haemorrhagic fever, characterized by a breakdown of the blood-clotting mechanism with internal bleeding, can affect children. Dengue occurs throughout the tropics and subtropics. Patients are given aspirin and codeine to relieve the pain and calamine lotion is helpful in easing the irritating rash.

denominator n. the part of the fetus that is used to describe positions for *presentation. For vertex (back of the head) presentation, it is the *occiput; for breech presentation, the sacrum; for face presentation, the mentum (chin).

denosumab n. a *monoclonal antibody most commonly used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis to prevent fractures but also indicated at a higher dose to prevent bone damage in patients with bone metastases. Side-effects include a risk of low calcium, infections, joint pains, fatigue, and headache, all more common with the higher doses.

dens n. a tooth or tooth-shaped structure.

dense deposit disease see mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis.

dens invaginatus literally, an infolded tooth: a specific type of tooth malformation that mainly affects upper lateral incisors to varying degrees. Also known as a dens in dente (‘tooth within a tooth’), it involves an infolding of enamel into dentine.

dent- (denti-, dento-) combining form denoting the teeth. Example: dentoalveolar (relating to the teeth and associated jaw).

dental care professional any of several professionals supporting a dentist, formerly referred to as dental auxiliaries and professionals complementary to dentistry. A dental hygienist performs scaling and instruction in oral hygiene. A dental nurse helps the dentist at the chairside by preparing materials, passing instruments, and aspirating fluids from the patient’s mouth. A dental technician constructs dentures, crowns, and orthodontic appliances in the laboratory for the dentist. A clinical dental technician provides dentures directly to patients. A dental therapist performs non-complex treatment under the prescription of a dentist. In the UK dental care professionals are required to be statutorily registered with the General Dental Council (GDC).

dental caries the decay and crumbling of the substance of a tooth. Dental caries is caused by the metabolism of the bacteria in *plaque attached to the surface of the tooth. Acid formed by bacterial breakdown of sugar in the diet causes demineralization of the enamel of the tooth. If no preventive measure or treatment is carried out it spreads into the dentine and progressively destroys the tooth. It is the most common cause of toothache, and once infection has spread to the pulp it may extend through the root canal into the periapical tissues to cause an *apical abscess.

Frequent intake of sugar as well as poor oral hygiene is a major cause. The disease is more common in young people and has a predilection for specific sites. Dental caries can be most effectively prevented by restricting the frequency of sugar intake and avoiding sweet food and drinks at bedtime. The resistance of enamel to dental caries can be increased by the application of *fluoride salts to the tooth surface from toothpastes or mouth rinses. *Fluoridation of water also makes teeth resistant to caries during the period of tooth development. Once caries has spread into the dentine, treatment usually consists of removing the decayed part of the tooth using a *drill and replacing it with a *filling.

dental chair a reclinable chair on which a patient lies for dental treatment. Electric switches change the position of the patient, and the chair is frequently attached to the *dental unit.

dental floss a fine thread, usually of nylon, used to clean the surfaces between teeth. A thicker version is known as dental tape. It may be waxed to help the user slide it past the tooth contacts.

dental handpiece a piece of dental equipment (high-speed or low-speed) for holding a dental *bur or *file. It is made of corrosion-resistant materials to allow sterilization. See drill.

dental implant see implant.

dental nerve either of two nerves that supply the teeth; they are branches of the trigeminal nerve. The inferior dental nerve supplies the lower teeth and for most of its length exists as a single large bundle; thus anaesthesia of it has a widespread effect (see inferior dental block). The superior dental nerve, which supplies the upper teeth, breaks into separate branches at some distance from the teeth and it is possible to anaesthetize these individually with less widespread effect for the patient.

dental nurse see dental care professional.

dental pantomogram (DPT) a special form of tomogram (see tomography) that provides a picture of all the teeth of both jaws on one film. Newer equipment can produce three-dimensional images of part of the jaw.

dental unit a major fixed piece of dental equipment to which are attached the dental drills, aspirator, compressed air syringe, and ultrasonic scaler. It is frequently integral with the *dental chair.

dentate adj. 1. having teeth. 2. serrated; having toothlike projections.

dentifrice n. any paste, powder, gel, or liquid used for cleaning the teeth. See toothpaste.

dentine n. the hard tissue that forms the main structure of a tooth. It is the second hardest tissue in the body after *enamel and is about 70% mineral (hydroxyapatite crystals), the remainder being organic matter and water. The dentine of the crown is covered by enamel and that of the root by cementum. The dentine is permeated by fine tubules, which near the centre of the tooth contain cellular processes from the pulp. Exposed dentine is sensitive to touch, heat, and cold.

dentinogenesis n. the formation of *dentine by *odontoblasts. Although dentinogenesis continues throughout life, very little dentine is formed later than a few years after tooth eruption unless it is stimulated by caries, abrasion, or trauma. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary condition in which dentine formation is disturbed; this may result in loss of overlying enamel and excessive wear of the dentine.

dentist n. a person who is qualified to examine, diagnose, and treat diseases and other conditions that affect the teeth and gums. In the UK, dentists must be registered with the General Dental Council (GDC).

dentistry n. the study, management, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and conditions affecting the mouth, jaws, teeth, and their supporting tissues. Subdisciplines include dental public health, *endodontics, oral medicine, oral surgery, *orthodontics, *paediatric dentistry, *periodontology, preventive dentistry, *prosthodontics, and restorative dentistry.

dentition n. the arrangement of teeth in the mouth. The primary dentition comprises the teeth of young children. It consists of 20 teeth, made up of incisors, canines, and molars only. The lower incisor erupts first at about 6 months of age, and all the primary teeth have usually erupted by the age of 2½ years. The lower incisors are shed first at about 6 years of age, and from this time until about 13 years old both primary and permanent teeth are present; i.e. there is a mixed dentition. The permanent dentition consists of up to 32 teeth, made up of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The first tooth to erupt is the first molar (at the age of 6 years) and most permanent teeth have appeared by the age of 14 years, although the third molars may not erupt until the age of 18–21 years. See illustrations.

Primary dentition.





Permanent dentition.





Dent’s disease a rare X-linked (see sex-linked) recessive inherited condition usually presenting in childhood or early adult life with polyuria, microscopic haematuria, renal stone disease, or rickets. The majority of patients have a mutation of the gene encoding chloride channel 5 (CLCN5); others have a defect of the OCRL1 gene, normally associated with Lowe’s syndrome, but do not present with the cataracts, learning disability, and tubular acidosis associated with this condition. In still others the genetic defect has yet to be defined but is not associated with either CLCN5 or OCRL1. Patients with Dent’s disease have evidence of proximal tubular dysfunction. [C. E. Dent (1911–76), British physician]

denture n. a removable replacement for one or more teeth carried on some type of plate or frame. A complete denture replaces all the teeth in one jaw. It is usually made entirely of acrylic resin. A partial denture replaces some teeth because others still remain. It is designed to restore function with the least potential damage to the remaining teeth. The framework of the denture base is often made of metal (*cobalt-chromium) because of its strength. (See also prosthesis.) Denture sore mouth is inflammation of the gum under the denture, caused by a mixed infection of Candida and bacteria under a poorly cleaned denture or removable orthodontic appliance. Denture hyperplasia is an overgrowth of fibrous tissue covered by mucous membrane, which results from chronic irritation by a denture.

Denys–Drash syndrome a rare disorder consisting of the triad of *nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour), congenital nephropathy, and intersex disorders, resulting from mutations in the Wilm’s tumour suppressor gene (WT1). Incomplete forms exist; congenital nephropathy, with diffuse mesangial sclerosis, is the constant feature with either Wilms’ tumour or intersex disorders, usually in the form of male *pseudohermaphroditism. [P. Denys (20th century), French physician; A. Drash (20th century), British physician]

deodorant n. an agent that reduces or removes unpleasant body odours by destroying bacteria that live on the skin and break down sweat. Deodorant preparations often contain an antiseptic.

deontology n. an approach to ethics that is concerned with what makes an action inherently right or wrong. Deontology’s emphasis on the primacy of observing duties and respecting rights is at odds with the approach that judges actions by their outcomes (see consequentialism). This tension is central to many issues in medical ethics; for example, in relation to *euthanasia, the wrong of killing versus the good outcome of ending suffering, and is further complicated when rights or duties are in conflict with one another, e.g. in relation to *abortion, the rights of the mother versus the rights of the fetus. See also Kantian ethics. —deontological adj.

deoxycholic acid see bile acids.

deoxycorticosterone n. a hormone, synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex, that regulates salt and water balance. See also corticosteroid.

deoxyribonuclease n. an enzyme, located in the *lysosomes of cells, that splits DNA at specific places in the molecule.

deoxyribonucleic acid see DNA.

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the major US government agency providing health care. The department was created in 1953 and assumed its current name in 1980. HHS administers more than 300 health and health-related programmes and services, including *Medicare and *Medicaid. Other activities include research, immunization services, and providing financial assistance for low-income families. Almost a quarter of federal spending occurs through HHS.

Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) (in Britain) a department of central government that supports the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in meeting his or her obligations, which include the *National Health Service, the promotion and protection of the health of the nation, and social care, including some oversight of personal social services provided by local authorities. The department is staffed by civil servants, including some health professionals. Following the reforms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the Department no longer has direct control of the NHS, which has passed to *NHS England. The name of the department was expanded from ‘Department of Health’ in 2018. Equivalent departments support the ministers responsible for health services in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

dependence (drug dependence) n. the physical and/or psychological effects produced by the habitual taking of certain drugs, characterized by a compulsion to continue taking the drug; in ICD-11 (see International Classification of Diseases) it is known as drug dependency syndrome. In physical dependence withdrawal of the drug causes specific symptoms (withdrawal symptoms), such as sweating, vomiting, or tremors, that are reversed by further doses. Substances that may induce physical dependence include alcohol and the ‘hard’ drugs morphine, heroin, and cocaine. Dependence on ‘hard’ drugs carries a high mortality, partly because overdosage may be fatal and partly because their casual injection intravenously may lead to infections such as *hepatitis and *AIDS. Treatment is difficult and requires specialist skills. Much more common is psychological dependence, in which repeated use of a drug induces reliance on it for a state of wellbeing and contentment, but there are no physical withdrawal symptoms if use of the drug is stopped. Substances that may induce psychological dependence include nicotine, cannabis, barbiturates, cocaine, and amphetamines.

dependent practitioner in the USA, a paraprofessional or subprofessional health-care worker who is allowed to provide a limited amount of treatment to patients, usually under the supervision of a licensed practitioner, such as a physician. Examples include a nurse practitioner or occupational therapist.

depersonalization n. a state in which a person feels him- or herself becoming unreal or strangely altered, or feels that the mind is becoming separated from the body. Minor degrees of this feeling are common in normal people under stress. Severe feelings of depersonalization occur in *anxiety disorder, in states of *dissociation, in depression and schizophrenia, and in epilepsy (particularly temporal-lobe epilepsy). See also derealization; out-of-body experience.

depilatory n. an agent applied to the skin to remove hair.

depolarization n. the sudden surge of charged particles across the membrane of a nerve cell or a muscle cell that accompanies a physicochemical change in the membrane and cancels out, or reverses, its resting potential to produce an *action potential. The passage of a *nerve impulse is a rapid wave of depolarization along the membrane of a nerve fibre.

depot injection the administration of a sustained-action drug formulation that allows slow release and gradual absorption, so that the active agent can act for much longer periods than is possible with standard injections. Depot injections are usually given deep into a muscle; some contraceptive hormones are available in a depot formulation.

depressant n. an agent that reduces the normal activity of any body system or function. Drugs such as general *anaesthetics, *barbiturates, and opioids are depressants of the central nervous system and respiration. *Cytotoxic drugs, such as azathioprine, are depressants of the levels of white blood cells.

depression n. 1. a mental state characterized by excessive sadness. 2. a mood disorder characterized by the pervasive and persistent presence of core and somatic symptoms on most days for at least two weeks. Core symptoms include low mood and loss or impairment of motivation, energy, interest, and enjoyment. Somatic symptoms include impaired memory and concentration, loss of appetite and libido, insomnia, early morning wakening (more than two hours earlier than normal), physical and mental activity that is either agitated and restless or slow and retarded, and a diurnal variation of mood (usually patients feel particularly depressed in the mornings). Additional symptoms include automatic negative thoughts, pessimistic views of oneself, the future, and the present (Beck’s triad of depression), suicidal *ideation, tearfulness, *alexithymia, and a poor frustration tolerance. A single period of experiencing these symptoms is called a major depressive episode; experiencing one or more of such episodes (without mania) is known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression. Depression may or may not be triggered by stressful events or trauma. Risk factors include genetic and social elements (e.g. poverty, lack of confidants, substance abuse) and psychological elements (e.g. the presence of personality disorder, a history of abuse or *dysthymia). Treatment is with *antidepressant drugs, *cognitive behavioural therapy, and/or *psychotherapy. Severe cases may need *electroconvulsive therapy. The course of the illness can be a single episode or recurrent episodes, or it may become chronic. —depressive adj.

depressor n. 1. a muscle that causes lowering of part of the body. The depressor labii inferioris is a muscle that draws down and everts the lower lip. 2. a nerve that lowers blood pressure.

derealization n. a feeling of unreality in which the environment is experienced as unreal and as flat, dull, or strange. The experience is unwelcome and often frightening. It occurs in association with *depersonalization or with the conditions that cause depersonalization, for example schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, or *dissociative disorder.

derm- (derma-, dermo-, dermat(o)-) combining form denoting the skin.

-derm combining form denoting 1. the skin. 2. a germ layer.

Dermacentor n. a genus of hard *ticks, worldwide in distribution, the adults of which are parasites of humans and other mammals. The wood tick, D. andersoni, transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever to humans in the western USA and the dog tick, D. variabilis, is the vector of this disease in the east.

dermal adj. relating to or affecting the skin, especially the *dermis.

Dermanyssus n. a genus of widespread parasitic mites. The red poultry mite, D. gallinae, is a common parasite of wild birds in temperate regions but can also infest poultry. It occasionally attacks and takes a blood meal from humans, causing itching and mild dermatitis.

dermatitis n. an inflammatory condition of the skin caused by outside agents (compare eczema, an endogenous disease in which such agents do not play a primary role, although some use the two terms interchangeably). Irritant contact dermatitis may occur in anyone who has sufficient contact with such irritants as acids, alkalis, solvents, and (especially) detergents. It is the commonest cause of occupational dermatitis in hairdressers, nurses, cooks, etc. (See also napkin rash.) In allergic contact dermatitis skin changes resembling those of eczema develop as a delayed (type IV) reaction to a particular allergen, which may be present at low concentrations. Common examples include nickel dermatitis (from costume jewellery, clothing fasteners, zips, etc.) and fragrance allergy (from toiletries, deodorants, perfumes, etc.). Treatment of dermatitis depends on identifying the allergen by *patch testing and removing the cause, which is not always possible.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is an uncommon very itchy rash with symmetrical blistering, especially on the knees, elbows, buttocks, and shoulders. It is associated with *gluten sensitivity and responds well to treatment with dapsone or a gluten-free diet.

Dermatobia n. a genus of nonbloodsucking flies inhabiting lowland woods and forests of South and Central America. The parasitic maggots of D. hominis can cause a serious disease of the skin in humans (see myiasis). The maggots burrow into the skin, after emerging from eggs transported by bloodsucking insects (e.g. mosquitoes), and produce painful boil-like swellings. Treatment involves surgical removal of the maggots.

dermatochalasis n. redundant eyelid skin, which may cause drooping of the upper lid. It usually occurs as a result of ageing. Compare blepharochalasis.

dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans a tumour probably derived from *histiocytes that may occur in any part of the body. It is locally invasive but tends not to metastasize. It often recurs locally despite excision.

dermatoglyphics n. 1. the patterns of finger, palm, toe, and sole prints. These patterns are formed by skin ridges, the distribution of which is unique to each individual. Abnormalities are found in those with chromosomal variants, such as *Down’s syndrome. 2. the study of these patterns. In addition to its use in medicine, dermatoglyphics is also of value in criminology and is of interest to anthropologists. See also fingerprint.

dermatology n. the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of skin disorders. —dermatological adj. —dermatologist n.

dermatology life quality index (DLQI) a validated questionnaire designed by Finlay in 1994 to assess the impact of skin diseases on psychological and social wellbeing. It is the most common *quality of life tool used as an endpoint in dermatology clinical trials. DLQI scores of more than 10 (indicating a severe impact on life) are required before biological treatments for psoriasis may be administered in the UK.

dermatome n. 1. a surgical instrument used for cutting thin slices of skin in some skin grafting operations. 2. that part of the segmented mesoderm in the early embryo that forms the deeper layers of the skin (dermis) and associated tissues. See somite.

dermatomyositis n. an inflammatory disorder of the skin and underlying tissues, including the muscles (in the absence of a rash it is known as *polymyositis). The condition is one of the *connective-tissue diseases. A pink/purple skin eruption occurs on the face, scalp, neck, shoulders, and knuckles (known as Gottron’s papules) and is later accompanied by severe swelling (see also heliotrope rash). Dermatomyositis is often associated with internal cancer in adults, though not in children.

Dermatophagoides n. a genus of *mites that have been detected in samples of dust taken from houses in various parts of Europe. House-dust mites feed on human skin and scales and cause dermatitis of the scalp. Waste products from the mites produce an allergic response in susceptible people that is an important trigger for some forms of *rhinitis and *asthma.

dermatophyte n. a fungus belonging to any one of the three genera (Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton) that can feed on *keratin and cause various forms of *ringworm (tinea); these infections may be referred to as dermatophytoses.

dermatosis n. any disease of skin, particularly one without inflammation. In juvenile plantar dermatosis, which affects children up to the age of 14, the skin on the front of the sole becomes red, glazed, and symmetrically cracked. This condition, which settles spontaneously after a number of years, is believed to be related to the wearing of trainers.

dermis (corium) n. the true *skin: the thick layer of living tissue that lies beneath the epidermis. It consists mainly of loose connective tissue within which are blood capillaries, lymph vessels, sensory nerve endings, sweat glands and their ducts, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and smooth muscle fibres. —dermal adj.

dermographism n. a common local reaction caused by stroking the skin, which develops itchy *weals. People with such highly sensitive skin can ‘write’ on it with a finger or blunt instrument. A rare delayed form exists. Dermographism can be confirmed with a calibrated instrument called a dermographometer. Antihistamines are first-line treatment.

dermoid cyst (dermoid) a benign tumour – a type of *teratoma – containing developmentally mature skin complete with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and often pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nails, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue, which may give rise to symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. It is usually found at sites marking the fusion of developing sections of the body in the embryo and is the most common benign ovarian tumour in girls and young women. Sometimes a dermoid cyst may develop after an injury. Treatment is complete surgical removal, preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents. Tumours in the skin are best removed by a plastic surgeon. Because of the risks of surgery and anaesthesia to pregnant women, it is usually considered more feasible to remove bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries discovered during pregnancy only if they grow beyond 6 cm in diameter. The procedure is usually performed through laparotomy or very carefully through laparoscopy and should preferably be done in the second trimester.

dermoscopy (dermatoscopy) n. the process whereby skin lesions are examined by a dermatoscope (an instrument with a magnifier and a nonpolarized light source). The dermatoscope is pressed firmly on the skin with a liquid medium (e.g. oil) between the instrument and the skin. The technique allows closer examination of pigment networks, vascular structures, etc., and may help to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.

descemetocele n. thinning of the *stroma of the cornea to such an extent that *Descemet’s membrane is all that is maintaining the integrity of the eyeball. It occurs in severe ulceration of the cornea.

Descemet’s membrane the membrane that forms the deepest layer of the *stroma of the cornea of the eye. The endothelium lies between it and the aqueous humour. [J. Descemet (1732–1810), French anatomist]

desensitization n. 1. (hyposensitization) a method for reducing the effects of a known allergen by injecting, over a period, gradually increasing doses of the allergen, until resistance is built up. See allergy. 2. a technique used in the *behaviour therapy of phobic states. The thing that is feared is very gradually introduced to the patient, first in imagination and then in reality. At the same time the patient is taught relaxation to inhibit the development of anxiety (see relaxation therapy). In this way he or she is able to cope with progressively closer approximations to the feared object or situation.

desert n. the state of deserving something. In medical ethics it is controversial to argue that some patients may be more deserving of treatment than others on the basis of their past or present conduct. See also need.

desferrioxamine n. a drug that combines with iron in body tissues and fluids and is used to treat iron poisoning, iron overload (including that resulting from prolonged or constant blood transfusion, as for thalassaemia), diseases involving iron storage in parts of the body (see haemochromatosis), and for the diagnosis of such diseases.

designer drug a psychoactive drug produced by minor chemical modification of existing illegal substances so as to circumvent prohibitive legislation. These drugs are manufactured in secret laboratories for profit, without regard to any probable medical and social dangers to the consumers.

desmoid tumour a dense connective-tissue tumour with a dangerous propensity for repeated local recurrence after treatment. Intra-abdominal desmoids have an association with familial adenomatous *polyposis (FAP).

DESMOND (diabetes education and self-management for ongoing and newly diagnosed) a structured one-day education programme for patients with type 2 diabetes, developed in 2003. Outcomes show an increase in participants’ understanding of diabetes and risk factors associated with coronary heart disease.

desmoplasia n. 1. the proliferation of *fibroblasts to produce a fibrous *stroma in response to a malignant tumour. It is a feature of the more aggressive tumours. 2. the formation of fibrous *adhesions. —desmoplastic adj.

desmopressin n. a synthetic derivative of *vasopressin that causes a decrease in urine output and is used to treat diabetes insipidus and nocturnal *enuresis. It is also effective in mild haemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease. Side-effects include stomach cramps, headache, and flushing of the skin.

desmosome n. an area of contact between two adjacent cells, occurring particularly in epithelia. The cell membranes at a desmosome are thickened and fine fibres (tonofibrils) extend from the desmosome into the cytoplasm.

desogestrel n. a *progestogen used in various *oral contraceptives, either alone or in combination with ethinylestradiol.

desquamation n. the process in which the outer layer of the *epidermis of the skin is removed by scaling.

detached retina see retinal detachment.

detergent n. a synthetic cleansing agent that removes all impurities from a surface by reacting with grease and suspended particles, including bacteria and other microorganisms. Detergents are used for cleansing or as *antiseptics and *disinfectants.

detoxification (detoxication) n. 1. the process whereby toxic substances are removed or toxic effects neutralized. It is one of the functions of the liver. 2. the period of withdrawal when a person stops long-term consumption of alcohol or some other drug. Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. *delirium tremens) may occur during detoxification.

detrition n. the process of wearing away solid bodies (e.g. bones) by friction or use.

detrusor n. the muscle of the urinary bladder wall. The functioning of the detrusor and urethral sphincter is assessed by a urodynamic investigation (see urodynamics). This is used to diagnose dysfunction, absent and exaggerated reflexes, and overactivity of the muscle (detrusor instability, overactive bladder syndrome). Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is due to neurological damage, as occurs in multiple sclerosis or in suprasacral spinal cord injury.

detumescence n. 1. the reverse of erection, whereby the erect penis or clitoris becomes flaccid after orgasm. 2. subsidence of a swelling.

deut- (deuto-, deuter(o-)) combining form denoting two, second, or secondary.

deuteranopia n. a defect in colour vision in which reds, yellows, and greens are confused. It is thought that the mechanisms for perceiving red light and green light are in some way combined in people with this defect. Compare protanopia; tritanopia. See also colour blindness.

deutoplasm n. see yolk.

developmental delay considerable delay in the physical or mental development of children when compared with their peers. There are many causes. Global delay is when there is delay in several areas of development (gross motor skills, fine motor skills and vision, language and hearing, personal and social).

developmental disorder any one of a group of conditions in infancy or childhood, that are characterized by delays in biologically determined psychological functions, such as language. They are more common in males than females and tend to follow a course of disability with gradual improvement. They are classified into pervasive conditions, in which many types of development are involved (e.g. *autism), and specific disorders, in which the disability is an isolated problem (such as *dyslexia).

developmental milestones skills gained by a developing child, which should be achieved by a given age. Examples of such milestones include smiling by six weeks and sitting unsupported by eight months. Failure to achieve a particular milestone by a given age is indicative of *developmental delay. See table.





deviance n. variation from normal behaviour beyond the limits acceptable to the majority of the conforming peer group; particularly (though not exclusively) applied to sexual habits (see also sexual deviation).

deviation n. 1. (in ophthalmology) any abnormal position of one or both eyes. For example, if the eyes are both looking to one side when the head is facing forwards, they are said to be deviated to that side. Such deviations of both eyes may occur in brain disease. Deviations of one eye, such as *dissociated vertical deviation, come into the category of squint (see strabismus). 2. see sexual deviation.

Devic’s disease see neuromyelitis optica. [E. Devic (1869–1930), French physician]

devitalization n. (in dentistry) 1. tooth death, normally as a result of disease, trauma, or (less commonly) orthodontic treatment. 2. the removal of a diseased pulp from a tooth. In primary teeth the coronal pulp alone may be removed, while the pulp in the root is kept alive or root canal treatment undertaken. For permanent teeth, see root canal treatment.

dew-point hygrometer see hygrometer.

DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) a method of measuring bone density based on the proportion of a beam of photons that passes through the bone. The results of a DEXA scan are expressed as a *T score. See also osteoporosis.

dexamethasone n. a *corticosteroid drug used principally to treat severe allergies, eye inflammation, rheumatic and other inflammatory conditions, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Side-effects include sodium and fluid retention, muscle weakness, convulsions, vertigo, headache, and hormonal disturbances (including menstrual irregularities). In the form of an implant into the vitreous humour, it is also used to treat oedema associated with *retinal vein occlusion. Dexamethasone is also used in a series of tests for Cushing’s syndrome (see dexamethasone suppression tests).

dexamethasone suppression tests (DSTs) tests based on the principle that appropriate doses of *dexamethasone can suppress the output of cortisol from the adrenal glands in the normal state and that this ability is reduced or lost in *Cushing’s syndrome. In the overnight DST 1 mg of dexamethasone is administered at midnight and the serum cortisol level is measured at 9.00 am the next morning. Failure to suppress cortisol output may indicate Cushing’s syndrome but also occurs in patients with obesity and depressive illness. In the low-dose DST (0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours), cortisol suppression occurs in patients with obesity and depression but not in those with Cushing’s syndrome. In the high-dose DST (2 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours), cortisol is suppressed in patients with Cushing’s disease (in which excess amounts of ACTH are secreted by the pituitary gland) but not in those with Cushing’s syndrome due to other causes. Although the low- and high-dose tests are unreliable, all three tests should be performed to aid the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome.

dexamfetamine (dexamphetamine) n. see amphetamines.

dextr- (dextro-) combining form denoting 1. the right side. Example: dextroposition (displacement to the right). 2. (in chemistry) dextrorotation.

dextran n. a carbohydrate, consisting of branched chains of glucose units, that is a storage product of bacteria and yeasts. Preparations of dextran solution are used in transfusions, to increase the volume of plasma.

dextrin n. a carbohydrate formed as an intermediate product in the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase. Dextrin is used in the preparation of pharmaceutical products (as an *excipient) and surgical dressings.

dextrocardia n. a congenital defect in which the position of the heart is a mirror image of its normal position, with the apex of the ventricles pointing to the right. It may be associated with other congenital defects and is often combined with situs invertus, in which the appendix and liver lie on the left side of the abdomen and the stomach lies on the right side. Isolated dextrocardia produces no adverse effects.

dextrose n. see glucose.

DFT dental foundation training: see foundation training.

DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) see omega-3 fatty acids.

DHEA see dehydroepiandrosterone.

DI see artificial insemination.

di- prefix denoting two or double.

dia- prefix denoting 1. through. 2. completely or throughout. 3. apart.

diabetes n. any disorder of metabolism causing excessive thirst and the production of large volumes of urine. Used alone, the term most commonly refers to *diabetes mellitus. See also diabetes insipidus; haemochromatosis (bronze diabetes). —diabetic adj., n.

diabetes insipidus a rare metabolic disorder in which the patient produces large quantities of dilute urine and is constantly thirsty. It is due to deficiency of the pituitary hormone *vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which regulates reabsorption of water in the kidneys, and is treated by administration of the hormone. See also water-deprivation test.

diabetes mellitus a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism leading to an abnormally high blood sugar (glucose) level (hyperglycaemia). As the blood sugar rises the typical symptoms of urinary frequency and increased thirst emerge. Tiredness, blurring of vision, and weight loss are also common. The long-term complications of diabetes are damage to the eye (diabetic *retinopathy), the kidney (*diabetic nephropathy), and the nerve supply to the feet (*diabetic neuropathy), as well as accelerated vascular disease leading to coronary heart disease or stroke. These can be delayed or avoided by good control of blood glucose levels, combined with blood pressure control and a healthy lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the *insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are damaged or destroyed, thought to be triggered by a viral environmental factor. It typically starts in childhood or adolescence (more than 80% of type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in people under the age of 20 years). Treatment with insulin injections needs to be started within a few weeks of the onset of symptoms and is almost invariably lifelong. Type 2 diabetes is a genetically determined resistance to insulin action on target tissues, primarily the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, and has become increasingly common in the UK and the developed world with the associated rise in obesity. People with type 2 diabetes outnumber those with type 1 diabetes by at least ten to one. The mainstay of treatment is a healthy diet, regular physical activity, weight control, and avoidance of tobacco in conjunction with *oral hypoglycaemic drugs. Insulin treatment is often required after 5–10 years from diagnosis, although less likely in people who have followed successful lifestyle management and have lost weight over time. A relatively new class of injectable treatment – the *GLP-1 receptor agonists – can help with both blood glucose and weight control. The rarer forms of diabetes mellitus include *maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and diabetes secondary to destruction of the pancreas (e.g. by pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and surgery). *Gestational diabetes mellitus is any form of diabetes first diagnosed in pregnancy.

Diabetes UK the main British support charity for patients with diabetes and workers in the diabetes field.

diabetic amyotrophy an acute mononeuropathy of the femoral nerve, usually of microvascular origin, associated with chronic poor diabetic control. Symptoms are thigh pain and progressive weakness of knee extension. Examination reveals wasting of the quadriceps muscle group and loss of the knee jerk. It may affect both legs and recovery is usually slow. Treatment is with physiotherapy and improved control of the diabetes; the condition never seems to recur in the same leg. The main *differential diagnosis is of compression of the nerve roots in the spinal canal.

diabetic glomerulosclerosis the characteristic microscopic changes seen in a diabetic kidney after many years of progressive damage.

diabetic hand syndrome the combination of features, often found in the hands of long-standing diabetic subjects, consisting of *Dupuytren’s contractures, knuckle pads, *carpal tunnel syndrome, *cheiroarthropathy, and sclerosing *tenosynovitis.

diabetic holiday foot syndrome a condition in which patients with diabetic sensory polyneuropathy (see diabetic neuropathy) suffer significant trauma to their insensate feet through holiday activities. These may include walking on hot flagstones or sand and wearing ill-fitting shoes. The condition may be prevented with prior education and advice and by maintaining safe footcare practices.

diabetic honeymoon period a well-recognized period just after the diagnosis of type 1 *diabetes mellitus when only very low insulin doses are required to control the condition. It lasts from months to a few years but inevitably ends, when dose requirements will increase quite quickly.

diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) a metabolic state resulting from a profound lack of insulin, usually found only in type 1 *diabetes mellitus but sometimes arising in people of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity with type 2 diabetes. Inability to inhibit glucose production from the liver results in *hyperglycaemia, which can be extreme and lead to severe dehydration. The concurrent failure to suppress fatty-acid production from adipose tissue results in the excess conversion of fatty acids to ketones in the liver (*ketosis) and the development of a metabolic *acidosis, which can be severe. Patients often present with vomiting (from the ketosis), which contributes to the dehydration. The condition is treated as a medical emergency with intravenous fluid and insulin; patients should be monitored in high-dependency units.

diabetic nephropathy progressive damage to the kidneys seen in some people with long-standing diabetes. Excessive leakage of protein into the urine is followed by gradual decline of the kidney function and even kidney failure. See also diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

diabetic neuropathy progressive damage to the peripheral nerves seen in some people with long-standing diabetes. It most commonly affects the legs, causing pain or numbness working up from the feet. There is no cure but drugs can sometimes be used to control the discomfort experienced, and good blood glucose control may prevent deterioration over time. See also diabetic holiday foot syndrome.

diabetic retinopathy see retinopathy.

diabetologist n. a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of *diabetes mellitus and the prevention of its long-term complications. In the UK most diabetologists are also endocrinologists.

diaclast n. a surgical instrument used for the destruction of the skull of a fetus. This rare procedure enables a dead fetus to be delivered through the birth canal (see decapitation).

diagnosis n. the process of determining the nature of a disorder by considering the patient’s *signs and *symptoms, medical background, and – when necessary – results of laboratory tests and X-ray examinations. Unlike therapeutic procedures, diagnostic processes usually do not directly benefit the patient in terms of treatment. See also differential diagnosis; prenatal diagnosis. Compare prognosis. —diagnostic adj.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders see DSM.

diagnostic peritoneal lavage the instillation of saline directly into the abdominal cavity and its subsequent aspiration a few minutes later. If the fluid is bloodstained on recovery an intra-abdominal haemorrhage is indicated. This is a useful diagnostic tool in trauma patients.

diakinesis n. the final stage in the first prophase of *meiosis, in which homologous chromosomes, between which crossing over has occurred, are ready to separate.

dialysate n. fluid used in the dialysis process. In *haemodialysis the dialysate is purified tap water to which has been added a precise amount of electrolyte solution. In *peritoneal dialysis the dialysate is a commercially produced fluid containing electrolytes with glucose, glucose polymers, or amino acids.

dialyser (dialyzer) n. a medical device designed to allow controllable transfer of solutes and water across a semipermeable membrane separating blood and *dialysate solutions flowing countercurrent to each other. Most modern dialysers are based on hollow-fibre technology and are tube-shaped. Blood enters the top of the tube and travels, by capillary action, down a large number of hollow microfibres, which are embedded in polyurethane at each end of the dialyser tube for support. Dialysate enters the tube from the side, near the bottom of the tube. It runs in the opposite direction to the blood, around the hollow fibres and separated from the blood by the semipermeable membrane that constitutes the microfibre wall. A number of different dialyser membranes are in use, displaying a wide variety of permeabilities (related to pore size), biocompatibilities (not activating *cytokine or alternate pathway *complement responses in the blood), and costs.

dialysis n. a method of separating particles of different dimensions in a liquid mixture, using a thin semipermeable membrane whose pores are too small to allow the passage of large particles, such as proteins, but large enough to permit the passage of dissolved crystalline material. A solution of the mixture is separated from distilled water by the membrane; the solutes pass through the membrane into the water while the proteins, etc., are retained. The principle of dialysis is used in the *dialyser (see also haemodialysis). The peritoneum is used as an autogenous semipermeable membrane in the technique of *peritoneal dialysis.

diamorphine n. the chemical name for heroin: a powerful opioid analgesic (see opiate) that is administered orally or by injection for the relief of acute and chronic pain, especially in terminal illness, and pulmonary oedema.

Dianette n. see cyproterone.

diapedesis n. migration of cells through the walls of blood capillaries into the tissue spaces. Diapedesis is an important part of the reaction of tissues to injury (see inflammation).

diaphoresis n. the process of sweating, especially excessive sweating. See sweat.

diaphoretic (sudorific) n. a drug that causes an increase in sweating. *Antipyretic drugs have diaphoretic activity, which helps reduce the body temperature in fevers.

diaphragm n. 1. (in anatomy) a thin musculomembranous dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The diaphragm is attached to the lower ribs at each side and to the breastbone and the backbone at the front and back. It bulges upwards against the heart and the lungs, arching over the stomach, liver, and spleen. There are openings in the diaphragm through which the oesophagus, blood vessels, and nerves pass. The diaphragm plays an important role in *breathing. It contracts with each inspiration, becoming flattened downwards and increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. With each expiration it relaxes and is restored to its dome shape. 2. a hemispherical rubber cap fitted inside the vagina over the neck (cervix) of the uterus as a contraceptive. When combined with the use of a chemical spermicide the diaphragm provides reliable contraception with a failure rate as low as 2–10 pregnancies per 100 woman-years.

diaphyseal aclasia see exostosis.

diaphysis n. the body, or shaft, of a long bone, which ossifies from a primary centre. It comprises a thick cylinder of compact bone surrounding a large medullary cavity. Compare epiphysis; physis. —diaphyseal adj.

diaphysitis n. inflammation of the diaphysis (shaft) of a bone, through infection or rheumatic disease. It may result in impaired growth of the bone and consequent deformity.

diarrhoea n. frequent bowel evacuation or the passage of abnormally soft or liquid faeces. It may be caused by intestinal infections, inflammation (such as *ulcerative colitis or *Crohn’s disease), *malabsorption, anxiety, drugs, and *irritable bowel syndrome. Severe or prolonged diarrhoea may lead to excessive loss of water, salts, and nutrients.

diarthrosis (synovial joint) n. a freely movable joint. The ends of the adjoining bones are covered with a thin cartilaginous sheet, and the bones are linked by a ligament (capsule) lined with *synovial membrane, which secretes synovial fluid (see illustration). Such joints are classified according to the type of connection between the bones and the type of movement allowed. See arthrodic joint; condylarthrosis; enarthrosis; ginglymus; saddle joint; trochoid joint.

A diarthrosis.





diaschisis n. a temporary loss of reflex activity in the brainstem or spinal cord following destruction of the cerebral cortex. As time passes this state of suppressed reflex activity is replaced by one of unduly exaggerated reflexes and spasticity of the limbs.

diastase n. an enzyme that hydrolyses starch in barley grain to produce maltose during the malting process. It has been used to aid the digestion of starch in some digestive disorders.

diastema n. a gap between two teeth.

diastole n. the period between two contractions of the heart, when the muscle of the heart relaxes and allows the chambers to fill with blood. The term usually refers to ventricular diastole, which lasts about 0.5 seconds in a normal heart rate of about 70/minute. During exertion this period shortens, so allowing the heart rate to increase. See also blood pressure; systole. —diastolic adj.

diastolic dysfunction impairment of heart function due to increased stiffness of the left *ventricle, which results in reduced capacity of the heart to fill with blood during diastole. The clinical effects of this are described as heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HEFNEF). Compare systolic dysfunction.

diastolic pressure see blood pressure.

diathermy n. the production of heat in a part of the body by means of a high-frequency electric current passed between two electrodes. Diathermy is utilized to coagulate tissues and seal off blood vessels, thus effecting *haemostasis. In bipolar diathermy electric current passes between the two electrodes of the instrument. In monopolar diathermy the instrument is one electrode, the other being a large pad applied to another part of the patient’s body. Examples of instruments used to deliver diathermy include diathermy knives, forceps, and scissors. Diathermy snares and needles can be used to destroy unwanted tissue and to remove small superficial neoplasms. See also electrosurgery.

diathesis n. a higher than average tendency to acquire certain diseases, such as allergies, rheumatic diseases, or gout. Such diseases may run in families, but they are not inherited.

diazepam n. a long-acting *benzodiazepine used for the short-term relief of acute anxiety and insomnia and in the treatment of delirium tremens, status epilepticus, and febrile convulsions; it is also used as a *premedication. Diazepam is administered by mouth, injection, or rectally and can cause dependence; side-effects include drowsiness and lethargy, confusion, and muscle weakness.

diazoxide n. a drug given to treat conditions in which the levels of blood sugar are chronically low (including *insulinoma).

DIC see disseminated intravascular coagulation.

dicephalus n. see craniopagus.

dichorionicity n. see chorionicity; twins. —dichorionic adj.

dichromatic adj. describing the state of colour vision of those who can appreciate only two of the three primary colours. People with such vision match any given colour by a mixture of the two they can distinguish. Compare trichromatic.

Dick test an obsolete immunological test for susceptibility to *scarlet fever. [G. F. Dick (1881–1967) and G. R. H. Dick (1881–1963), US physicians]

diclofenac n. an anti-inflammatory drug (see NSAID) used to relieve joint pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute gout, and actinic *keratosis, and also for pain relief after surgery. Possible side-effects include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhoea; gastric ulceration can be prevented by administering diclofenac in combination with *misoprostol.

dicophane n. see DDT.

dicrotism n. a condition in which the pulse is felt as a double beat for each contraction of the heart. It may be seen in typhoid fever. —dicrotic adj.

didanosine (ddI) n. an antiretroviral drug that interferes with the action of the enzyme *reverse transcriptase, by means of which HIV, the cause of AIDS, is able to incorporate itself into the human host cell. In combination with other antiretroviral drugs, it is used to treat HIV infection and AIDS. Possible side-effects include damage to nerves, severe pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, and headache.

DIDMOAD syndrome see Wolfram syndrome.

didym- (didymo-) combining form denoting the testis.

dieldrin n. an insecticide that attacks the central nervous system of insects and has proved useful in the control of various beetles, flies, and larvae that attack crops. Because of its persistence in and contamination of the environment, its use in the UK is now severely restricted.

diencephalon n. an anatomical division of the forebrain, consisting of the epithalamus, thalamus (dorsal thalamus), hypothalamus, and ventral thalamus (subthalamus). See brain.

diet n. 1. the mixture of foods that a person eats. A balanced diet contains the correct proportions of all the nutrients, i.e. vitamins, minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chlorine, sulphur, magnesium, the *trace elements), and *dietary fibre, as well as water, carbohydrates and fats (which provide energy), and proteins (required for growth and maintenance). 2. a restrictive regime of food intake used by an individual to lose weight.

dietary fibre (roughage) nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), which cannot be digested and absorbed to produce energy; specifically, sources of NSP that do not contain lignin or resistant starch. Fibre is divided into two types: insoluble (cellulose and hemicelluloses) and soluble (pectins). Highly refined foods, such as sucrose, do not contain dietary fibre. Foods with a high fibre content include wholemeal cereals, vegetables, nuts, and fruit. A diet high in insoluble fibre (e.g. wheat bran, wholegrain and wholemeal bread and cereals) may help prevent bowel diseases, such as constipation, diverticulitis, and colon cancer. Soluble fibre (e.g. oats, barley, beans, pulses, fruit, and vegetables) slows the reabsorption of *bile salts and so helps to lower cholesterol as well as dampening the glycaemic response to glucose (see glycaemic index). A high-fibre diet used to be the first-line advice for irritable bowel syndrome; however, a low *FODMAP diet can be more effective.

Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) a set of statistical terms used to describe nutritional requirements.

EAR estimated average requirement: the amount of energy or a nutrient that will meet the needs of 50% of the population.

RDA recommended daily amount: the average amount of a nutrient that should be provided per head of a group of people if the needs of practically all members of the group are to be met.

LRNI lowest recommended nutrient intake: the amount of a nutrient that provides only 2.5% of the population with their requirements.

RNI reference nutrient intake: the amount that is sufficient for almost 97.5% of individuals in a population. It is the term usually used when expressing dietary requirements.

safe level: used when there is insufficient data to determine the RNI, set as the average requirement plus 20%.

RI reference intake: a guide to how many calories and nutrients an average person can consume each day for a healthy balanced diet. This is used in labelling information for energy, protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fat, saturated fat, fibre, and salt.





dietetics n. the application of the principles of *nutrition to the selection of food and the feeding of individuals and groups. It is practised by dietitians, who use the most up-to-date public health and scientific research on food, health, and disease, which they translate into practical guidance to enable people to make appropriate lifestyle and food choices.

diethylcarbamazine n. an anthelmintic drug that destroys filariae and is therefore used in the treatment of filariasis and loiasis. Side-effects may include headache, malaise, joint pains, nausea, and vomiting.

diethylstilbestrol (DES) n. a synthetic female sex hormone (see oestrogen) that was prescribed in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. It was subsequently found to increase the risk of cancers of the uterus, ovary, and breast, particularly the risk of *clear-cell carcinoma of the genital tract in the daughters of patients who were treated with it. Although licensed to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women and prostate cancer, DES is rarely used because of its toxicity.

Dietl’s crisis acute obstruction of a kidney causing severe pain in the loins. The obstruction usually occurs at the junction of the renal pelvis and the ureter, causing the kidney to become distended with accumulated urine (see hydronephrosis). Sometimes the pelvis drains spontaneously, with relief of pain, but acute decompression of the kidney may be required with surgical relief of the obstruction (*pyeloplasty). [J. Dietl (1804–78), Polish physician]

Dieulafoy’s lesion an abnormality of small blood vessels (microscopically, an arteriovenous malformation), identified predominantly in the mucosal lining of the upper stomach, that may cause severe spontaneous haemorrhage. It can rarely be found in the duodenum, colon, jejunum, or oesophagus. If detected endoscopically, curative therapy is often possible, although the abnormality is often difficult to see at gastroscopy. Surgical exploration may be required if the bleeding is unresponsive to endoscopic treatment. [G. Dieulafoy (1839–1911), French physician]

differences of sexual development (DSDs) see intersex.

differential diagnosis *diagnosis of a condition whose signs and/or symptoms are shared by various other conditions. For example, abdominal pain may be due to any of a large number of different disorders, most of which must be ruled out in arriving at a correct diagnosis.

differential leucocyte count (differential blood count) a determination of the proportions of the different kinds of white cells (leucocytes) present in a sample of blood. Usually 100 white cells are counted and classified under the microscope or by electronic apparatus, so that the results can readily be expressed as percentages of the total number of leucocytes and the absolute numbers per litre of blood. The information often aids diagnosis of disease.

differentiation n. 1. (in embryology) the process in embryonic development during which unspecialized cells or tissues become specialized for particular functions. 2. (in oncology) the degree of similarity of tumour cells to the structure of the organ from which the tumour arose. Tumours are classified as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated: well differentiated tumours appear similar to the cells of the organ in which they arose; poorly differentiated tumours do not. Such classification is often of prognostic significance and determines the *grade of the tumour. Well-differentiated tumours are low-grade; poorly differentiated tumours are high-grade.

diffuse oesophageal spasm a disorder affecting the gullet (oesophagus) in which uncoordinated, sometimes simultaneous, oesophageal contractions precipitate difficulty in swallowing (*dysphagia), regurgitation of food, and chest pain. The cause is unclear. Diagnosis is suggested by characteristic appearances during a *barium swallow (corkscrew oesophagus) and confirmed by oesophageal manometry. Medical treatment comprises the use of calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, and sildenafil; endoscopic treatment may include infiltration of *botulinum toxin in specific oesophageal segments and, infrequently, endoscopic dilatation. Surgical myotomy is reserved for extreme cases.

diffusion tensor imaging a variant of *diffusion weighted imaging in which both the direction and the amount of diffusion of water molecules in a tissue are coded in the image. This MRI technique can be valuable in linear structures, such as nerves and muscle fibres. In the brain the major tracts and their communications can be studied with this technique (see tractography).

diffusion weighted imaging a method of creating images by *magnetic resonance imaging that relies on the amount of available space that individual water molecules have to move in, which depends on the local microstructure. Pathological tissues generally are less organized, with more space for diffusion and a higher signal.

di George syndrome a hereditary condition resulting in an inability to fight infections (immunodeficiency) associated with absence of the parathyroid gland and the thymus, abnormalities of the heart, and low calcium levels. Affected children are prone to *Candida infections and often present with *failure to thrive. The condition has also been named CATCH-22: Cardiac abnormalities, Abnormal facies, T-cell deficiency (from absent thymus), Cleft palate, Hypocalcaemia, chromosome 22 (in which the defect lies). [A. M. di George (1921–2009), US paediatrician]

digestion n. the process in which ingested food is broken down in the alimentary canal into a form that can be absorbed and assimilated by the tissues of the body. Digestion includes mechanical processes, such as chewing, churning, and grinding food, as well as the chemical action of digestive enzymes and other substances (bile, acid, etc.). Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with the action of *saliva on food, but most of it takes place in the stomach and small intestine, where the food is subjected to *gastric juice, *pancreatic juice, and *succus entericus.

digit n. any one of the terminal divisions of a limb: a finger or toe.

digital adj. 1. (in anatomy) relating to a digit. 2. (in radiology) relating to or utilizing *digitization.

digital hearing aid see hearing aid.

digital image an image made up of *pixels. Each pixel has numbers (digits) to describe its position and shade on the *grey scale. The more shades available, described by the number of computer bits required to store the shade of grey, the more accurately the image represents the original tissue contrast. An 8-bit computer image shows 28 (256) possible shades of grey, close to the maximum the human eye can differentiate. 12-bit (4096 levels of grey) images are of much higher quality and take up more memory. They can be manipulated more easily by computer using image enhancement techniques. Compare analogue image.

digitalis n. an extract from the dried leaves of foxgloves (Digitalis species), which contains various substances, including the *glycoside *digoxin (known as a cardiac glycoside), which stimulates heart muscle and is used medicinally.

digitalization n. the administration of a derivative of *digitalis to a patient with heart failure until the optimum level has been reached in the heart tissues. At this stage the control of heart failure should be adequate and there should be few side-effects. The process of digitalization may take several days.

digital radiography (DR) an alternative to film radiography, by acquiring X-ray images from a large number of individual X-ray detectors on a matrix in a digital format directly. This contrasts with *computerized radiography, in which an *analogue image is taken and then put into a reader to be converted into a *digital image. The technique allows the storage of images and their subsequent retrieval, manipulation, and interpretation using computers (see PACS).

digital spot imaging (DSI) the production of static images using an *image intensifier, usually during a fluoroscopic examination. The images can be stored digitally (see digitization) and either transferred to photographic film or viewed on a TV monitor.

digital subtraction a radiological technique that enhances visualization of blood vessels (see angiography). A digitized image is taken before the contrast medium (a ‘mask’) is injected, and this is subtracted by computer from the images taken after contrast injection. Only the blood vessels remain on the image. The technique enables blood-vessel anatomy and blood supply to an organ to be demonstrated more clearly. The quality of the image is very dependent on the patient remaining still, since movement causes severe loss of image (movement *artifact). The technique can also be used in nuclear medicine using two different tracers to look for parathyroid gland tumours.

digitization n. (in radiology) the conversion of an *analogue image to a *digital image. The image is broken down to pixels and numerical values assigned to each pixel for its position and to describe its shade on the *grey scale. This allows storage, electronic manipulation, and transfer via computer links of any images, including radiographs or CT, MRI, or ultrasound scans.

dignity n. (in clinical practice) a patient’s sense that they are respected as an individual and that they are not being exposed unnecessarily or without their agreement to procedures they might find degrading. The preservation of dignity is important whenever people are undressed, asked very personal questions, seen by more than one clinician, discussed in a group in the third person, or involved in activities that are not essential (such as teaching). Clinical failures here may lead to lack of compliance with treatment (see adherence) or even *complaint or depression (because of humiliation and loss of self-worth). Dignity is important when patients have lost abilities or have learning difficulties, and is vital in the care of any client group where help is needed with personal functions or when someone is *dying. See also autonomy.

digoxin n. a cardiac glycoside – a drug extracted from *digitalis – that increases the force of heart muscle contraction and decreases heart rate. It is used mainly to control atrial fibrillation. Possible side-effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and abnormal heart activity.

dihydrocodeine n. an opioid *analgesic used to relieve moderate to severe pain (see opiate). It sometimes causes nausea, dizziness, and constipation. Dependence of the *morphine type can also occur, but this is rare. Dihydrocodeine may be administered in combination with *paracetamol (as co-dydramol).

dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor any of various drugs that interfere with the conversion of folate to its active form in the body. They include *pyrimethamine, *trimethoprim, and *methotrexate. When such drugs are necessary, folate deficiency is treated with *folinic acid rather than folic acid.

dihydrotestosterone (DHT) n. a product formed from the action of the enzyme 5α-reductase on *testosterone. Mostly derived from the peripheral conversion of testosterone, some DHT is also secreted directly by the testes. DHT is an estimated 2.5 times more potent than testosterone but is present in much smaller amounts in the circulation.

diiodotyrosine n. an iodine-containing substance produced in the thyroid gland from which the *thyroid hormones are derived.

dilaceration n. a condition affecting some teeth after traumatic injury, in which the incomplete root continues to form at an abnormal angle to the part already formed. In severe cases it may be necessary to remove the tooth.

dilatation n. the enlargement or expansion of a hollow organ (such as a blood vessel) or cavity.

dilatation and curettage (D and C) an operation in which the cervix (neck) of the uterus is dilated, using an instrument called a *dilator, and the lining (endometrium) of the uterus is lightly scraped off with a manual curette (see curettage) or removed by suction using an aspirator. It is performed for a variety of reasons, including the removal of any material remaining after miscarriage and obtaining an endometrial biopsy for histological examination.

dilator n. 1. an instrument used to enlarge a body opening or cavity. For example, a dilator can be used to widen the male urethra if it becomes narrowed by disease. Dilators (such as Hegar’s dilator) are also used to enlarge the canal in the cervix of the uterus in the procedure of *dilatation and curettage. 2. a drug, applied either locally or systemically, that causes expansion of a structure, such as the pupil of the eye or a blood vessel. See also vasodilator. 3. a muscle that, by its action, opens an aperture or orifice in the body.

diltiazem n. a *calcium-channel blocker used in the prevention and treatment of angina and high blood pressure (hypertension), acting as a vasodilator. Side-effects include oedema, headache, nausea, dizziness, and skin rash. Diltiazem may also be administered as a topical cream for chronic anal fissures.

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) a drug that is instilled (in solution) into the bladder for the relief of symptoms of *interstitial cystitis.

dimeticone (dimethicone) n. a silicone preparation used to treat head lice; it forms a coating around the parasites that prevents their excretion of water.

dioptre n. the unit of measurement of the power of *refraction of a lens. One dioptre is the power of a lens that brings parallel light rays to a focus at a point one metre from the lens, after passing through it. A stronger lens brings light rays to a focus at a point closer to it than a weaker lens and has a higher dioptric power.

Dioralyte n. see oral rehydration therapy.

dipeptidase n. an enzyme, found in digestive juices, that splits certain products of protein digestion (dipeptides) into their constituent amino acids. The latter are then absorbed by the body.

dipeptide n. a compound consisting of two amino acids joined together by a peptide bond (e.g. glycylalanine, a combination of the amino acids glycine and alanine). See dipeptidase.

diphenoxylate n. see co-phenotrope.

diphtheria n. an acute highly contagious infection, caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, generally affecting the throat but occasionally other mucous membranes and the skin. The disease is spread by direct contact with a patient or carrier or by contaminated milk. After an incubation period of 2–6 days a sore throat, weakness, and mild fever develop. Later, a soft grey membrane forms across the throat, constricting the air passages and causing difficulty in breathing and swallowing; a *tracheostomy may be necessary. Bacteria multiply at the site of infection and release a toxin into the bloodstream, which damages heart and nerves. Death from heart failure or general collapse can follow within 4 days but prompt administration of antitoxin and penicillin arrests the disease. An effective immunization programme has now made diphtheria rare in most Western countries (see also Schick test).

diphtheroid adj. resembling diphtheria (especially the membrane formed in diphtheria) or the bacteria that cause it.

diphyllobothriasis n. an infestation of the intestine with the broad tapeworm, *Diphyllobothrium latum, which sometimes causes nausea, malnutrition, diarrhoea, and anaemia resulting from impaired absorption of vitamin B12 through the gut. The infestation, common in Baltic countries, is contracted following ingestion of uncooked fish infected with the larval stage of the tapeworm. The tapeworm can be expelled from the gut with the anthelmintic *mepacrine.

Diphyllobothrium n. a genus of large tapeworms that can grow to a length of 3–10 m. The adult of D. latum, the broad (or fish) tapeworm, infects fish-eating mammals including humans, in whom it may cause serious anaemia (see diphyllobothriasis). The parasite has two intermediate hosts: a freshwater crustacean and a fish (see also plerocercoid).

diploë n. the lattice-like tissue that lies between the inner and outer layers of the *skull.

diploid adj. describing cells, nuclei, or organisms in which each chromosome except the Y sex chromosome is represented twice. Compare haploid; triploid. —diploid n.

diplopia n. double vision: the simultaneous awareness of two images of one object. It is usually due to limitation of movement of one eye so that the two eyes cannot simultaneously look at the same object. This may be caused by a defect of the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement or a mechanical restriction of eyeball movement in the orbit (binocular diplopia). Double vision that does not disappear on covering one eye (monocular diplopia) can be caused by early cataract (see also polyopia).

diplotene n. the fourth stage in the first prophase of *meiosis, in which *crossing over occurs between the paired chromatids of homologous chromosomes, which then begin to separate.

diprosopus n. a fetal disorder, with a single trunk and normal limbs but with some degree of duplication of the face.

dipsomania n. morbid and insatiable craving for alcohol, occurring in paroxysms. A small proportion of alcoholics show this symptom (see alcoholism). The term (meaning ‘compulsive thirst’) has occasionally been used in relation to individuals with schizophrenia, who drink water or juices excessively.

Diptera n. a large group of insects, including *mosquitoes, gnats, midges, house flies, and *tsetse flies, that possess a single pair of wings. The mouthparts of many species, e.g. mosquitoes and tsetse flies, are specialized for sucking blood; these forms are important in the transmission of disease (see vector). See also fly.

Dipylidium n. a genus of tapeworms. D. caninum, a common parasite of the small intestine of dogs and cats, occasionally infects humans but usually produces no obvious symptoms. Fleas are the intermediate hosts, and children in close contact with pets become infected on ingesting fleas harbouring the parasite.

dipyridamole n. a drug that dilates the blood vessels of the heart and reduces platelet aggregation. It is given by mouth to prevent thrombosis around prosthetic heart valves. It may cause headache, stomach upsets, and dizziness. A combination of modified-release dipyridamole and aspirin is given to prevent recurrent stroke in patients who have had a transient ischaemic attack or an ischaemic stroke.

directly observed therapy (DOT) see tuberculosis.

director n. an instrument used to guide the extent and direction of a surgical incision.

direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) a relatively recently introduced class of drugs that reduce coagulation of the blood by inhibition of one of the coagulation factors (Factor Xa). They may be used as an alternative to *warfarin in many (but not all) cases, their advantage being that regular blood tests are not required for dose adjustment. Examples include, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.

Director of Public Health (DPH) a senior public health consultant or specialist in a local authority. Responsibilities include advising on the health needs of the local population. See also public health consultant; public health specialist.

dis- prefix denoting separation.

disability n. a substantial long-term restriction of functional ability or activity as a result of *impairment of the body or mind. Most modern definitions of disability, including that supplied by the World Health Organization, recognize that it is a complex condition that includes a social dimension. In other words, an individual’s experience of being disabled may in part reflect social and environmental factors that deny opportunities and full participation in society. See also handicap.

disability-adjusted life year (DALY) a common research measure of disease burden that accounts for both morbidity and mortality. One year lived in full health is equivalent to one DALY. Disabilities and disease states are assigned a weighting that reduces this figure, such that a year lived with disability is equivalent to less than one DALY. Some studies also use social weighting, in which years lived as a young adult receive a greater DALY weight than those lived as a young child or older adult. See also health-adjusted life expectancy; quality of life.

disability living allowance (DLA) (in Britain) a state benefit payable to help with the extra costs of looking after a child under the age of 16 with special needs. It has two components: a care component, payable at three rates to children needing help with personal care; and a mobility component, payable at two rates to those aged 3 years or over who need help with walking. The rates depend on the level of help required. DLA for adults aged 16–64 years has been replaced by the *personal independence payment (PIP). People aged over 65 years with a disability and requiring help may be eligible for the attendance allowance.

Disability Rights Commission see Equality and Human Rights Commission.

disaccharide n. a carbohydrate consisting of two linked *monosaccharide units. The most common disaccharides are *maltose, *lactose, and *sucrose.

disarticulation n. separation of two bones at a joint. This may be the result of an injury or it may be done by the surgeon at operation in the course of amputation; for example of a limb, finger, or toe.

disc n. (in anatomy) a rounded flattened structure, such as an *intervertebral disc or the *optic disc.

disc cupping an abnormal enlargement of the central depression of the *optic disc due to loss of nerve fibres, as occurs in glaucoma.

discectomy n. surgical removal of part (partial discectomy) or all (total discectomy) of a diseased or damaged intervertebral disc. It is performed for the relief of neurological symptoms arising from a displaced intervertebral disc compressing a nerve root or the spinal cord (see prolapsed intervertebral disc) or as part of a more extensive procedure. See also microdiscectomy.

disc herniation displacement of an intervertebral disc through a tear in the fibrous outer coat of the disc. See prolapsed intervertebral disc.

discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) see lupus erythematosus.

discontinuation syndrome symptoms that arise from the sudden cessation of certain centrally acting drugs, such as antidepressants, beta blockers, and antihypertensives. Experiences include a rebound effect in which the original symptoms return but are temporarily worse than before, flulike symptoms and headaches, nausea, and giddiness that is usually short-lived and stops within 36 hours. This syndrome is not a sign of addiction and it does not indicate dependency.

discrimination n. treating individuals differently on the basis of morally insignificant characteristics, such as race, sex, or religion. In medicine, any discrimination of this kind (e.g. when deciding on treatments or allocating resources) offends against the ethical principle of *justice. Legally, discrimination can be direct (i.e. overtly differentiating between people and groups) or indirect (i.e. behaviour that will disproportionately affect particular people or some groups more than others). See also equality; stigma.

disease n. a disorder with a specific cause (which may or may not be known) and recognizable signs and symptoms; any bodily abnormality or failure to function properly, except that resulting directly from physical injury (the latter, however, may open the way for disease). It is often contrasted with illness, where the abnormal symptoms, thoughts, or feelings may be subjective and difficult to assess objectively.

disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) any of various drugs used in the treatment of rheumatic disease: they affect the progression of the disease by suppressing the disease process. DMARDs include drugs affecting the immune response (immunomodulators), such as *immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate) and *cytokine inhibitors; *gold salts; *penicillamine; *sulfasalazine; and *hydroxychloroquine.

disembarkment syndrome see mal de debarquement.

disimpaction n. 1. the process of separating the broken ends of a bone when they have been forcibly driven together during a fracture. 2. (faecal disimpaction) see constipation.

disinfectant n. an agent that destroys or removes bacteria and other microorganisms. In medicine disinfectants are used to cleanse unbroken skin. An example is *cetrimide.

disinfection n. the process of eliminating infective microorganisms from contaminated instruments, clothing, or surroundings by using physical means or chemicals (*disinfectants).

disinfestation n. the destruction of insect pests and other animal parasites. This generally involves the use of insecticides applied either topically, as in delousing, or as a spray for eliminating an infestation of fleas or bed bugs in the home.

disjunction n. the separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes during meiosis or of the chromatids of a chromosome during *anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Compare nondisjunction.

dislocation (luxation) n. displacement from their normal position of bones meeting at a joint such that there is complete loss of contact of the joint surfaces. It usually results from trauma (e.g. dislocation of the shoulder, which is common in sports injuries, and dislocation of the mandible from the temporomandibular joint) but may be congenital, in which case it usually affects the hip (see congenital dislocation of the hip). In a traumatic dislocation the bones are restored to their normal positions by manipulation under local or general anaesthesia (see reduction). Compare subluxation.

dismemberment n. the separating of body parts or the amputation of a leg, arm, or part of a limb.

disodium pamidronate see pamidronate.

disoma n. a double-bodied fetus with a single head.

disopyramide n. an *anti-arrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Side-effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, difficulty in urination, and digestive upsets may occur.

disorders of sexual development (DSDs) see intersex.

disorganized schizophrenia see hebephrenia.

disorientation n. the state produced by loss of awareness of space, time, or personality. It can be the result of drugs, mental illness, or organic disease and is one of the symptoms tested for in the *mental state examination.

dispensary n. a place where medicines are made up by a pharmacist according to the doctor’s prescription and dispensed to patients. A dispensary is often part of an out-patient department in a hospital.

dispensing practice (in Britain) a general practice with a dispensary on site to issue prescribed medications to patients. See also general practitioner.

displacement n. (in psychology) the substitution of one type of behaviour for another, usually the substitution of a relatively harmless activity for a harmful one; for example, kicking the cat instead of one’s boss.

dissection n. the cutting apart and separation of the body tissues along the natural divisions of the organs and different tissues in the course of an operation. In *interventional radiology, dissection refers specifically to pathological dissection of the intimal layer of an aorta or artery that allows blood to pass through *subintimal space. This may result in occlusion of the vessel branches. Dissection of corpses is carried out for the study of anatomy.

disseminated adj. widely distributed in an organ (or organs) or in the whole body. The term may refer to disease organisms or to pathological changes.

disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) a condition resulting from overstimulation of the blood-clotting mechanisms in response to disease or injury, such as severe infection, malignancy, acute leukaemia, burns, severe trauma, or severe haemorrhage during childbirth (see also abruptio placentae). The overstimulation results in generalized blood coagulation and excessive consumption of coagulation factors. The resulting deficiency of these may lead to spontaneous bleeding. Transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate are given along with blood to replace the depleted clotting factors; treatment of the underlying cause is essential.

disseminated sclerosis see multiple sclerosis.

dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) a condition in which one eye looks upwards when the amount of light entering it is reduced, e.g. when it is covered. The eye returns to its original position when the cover is removed. DVD is an acquired condition chiefly associated with infantile esotropia (convergent *strabismus). The deviation is dissociated since there is no movement of the focusing (i.e. uncovered) eye during the deviation or return phase.

dissociation n. (in psychiatry) the process whereby thoughts and ideas can be split off from consciousness and may function independently, thus (for example) allowing conflicting opinions to be held at the same time about the same object. Dissociation may be the main factor in cases of dissociative *fugue and multiple personalities.

dissociative disorder any one of a group of mental disorders characterized by a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between awareness of one’s own identity, memories of the past, and control of bodily movements. They tend to remit spontaneously after hours, days, or months. The symptoms are explained psychoanalytically as extreme *defence mechanisms. They include loss of memory for important personal details (see amnesia), wandering away from home (see fugue), the assumption of a new identity, and trancelike states with severely reduced response to external stimuli. *Conversion disorder is classified with dissociative disorders (as dissociative (conversion) disorders) in ICD-10 (see International Classification of Diseases).

distal adj. 1. (in anatomy) situated away from the origin or point of attachment or from the median line of the body. For example, the term is applied to a part of a limb that is furthest from the body; to a blood vessel that is far from the heart; and to a nerve fibre that is far from the central nervous system. Compare proximal. 2. (in dentistry) describing the surface of a tooth away from the midline of the jaw.

distichiasis n. a very rare condition in which there is an extra row of eyelashes behind the normal row. They may rub on the cornea.

distraction n. (in orthopaedics) increasing the distance between two points. In *limb lengthening procedures callus can be stretched longitudinally by increasing the distance between pins attached to the bone (see callotasis).

distraction test a hearing test used for screening infants between the ages of six and ten months. The infant is placed on its carer’s knee, one examiner sits in front of the infant and gains its attention, and a second examiner is situated just behind the infant. At a given moment the first examiner becomes very still and the second examiner makes a sound at the level of the infant’s ear to one side or the other. If the infant can hear it turns in the direction of the sound. The sounds made should be of different pitches and a given loudness.

distribution n. the dispersion of a set of observations (e.g. of heights, weights, or blood pressures) about their arithmetic *mean. A normal or Gaussian distribution is a continuous distribution that is symmetrical around the mean value and in which a large majority of the observations fall within one *standard deviation of the mean in either direction: such a distribution forms the familiar symmetrical bell curve when plotted on a graph. In a skewed or asymmetrical distribution, the measurements are clustered on one side of the mean and spread out over a wider range on the other. See also frequency distribution; significance.

district nurse a trained nurse with special training in *domiciliary services, usually employed by a clinical commissioning group or health board. District nurses may also be allocated to a designated general practice, an arrangement known as *attachment.

disulfiram n. a drug used in the treatment of chronic alcoholism. It acts as a deterrent by producing unpleasant effects when taken with alcohol, including flushing, breathing difficulties, headache, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. Common side-effects are fatigue, nausea, and constipation.

dithranol n. a drug applied to the skin to treat *psoriasis.

diuresis n. increased secretion of urine by the kidneys. This normally follows the drinking of more fluid than the body requires, but it can be stimulated by the administration of a *diuretic. A temporary diuresis can also occur following the relief of urinary tract obstruction.

diuretic n. a drug that increases the volume of urine produced by promoting the excretion of salts and water from the kidney. The main classes of diuretics act by inhibiting the reabsorption of salts and water from the kidney tubules into the bloodstream. Thiazide diuretics (e.g. *bendroflumethiazide, *chlortalidone) act at the distal convoluted tubules (see nephron), preventing the reabsorption of sodium and potassium. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. *amiloride, *spironolactone, *triamterene) prevent excessive loss of potassium at the distal convoluted tubules, and loop diuretics (e.g. *furosemide) prevent reabsorption of sodium and potassium in *Henle’s loop. Diuretics are used to reduce the oedema due to salt and water retention in disorders of the heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs. Thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics are also used – in conjunction with other drugs – in the treatment of high blood pressure. Treatment with thiazide and loop diuretics often results in potassium deficiency; this is corrected by simultaneous administration of potassium salts or a potassium-sparing diuretic.

diurnal adj. relating to the daylight hours; daily. See circadian.

diurnal variation of mood a common symptom of *depression, in which the patient regularly experiences different mood states at different times of day. Classically, a depressed patient will complain of particularly low mood in the morning and this gradually improves during the day.

divarication n. the separation or stretching of bodily structures. Rectus divarication is stretching of the *rectus abdominis muscle, a common condition associated with pregnancy or obesity.

divaricator n. 1. a scissor-like surgical instrument used to divide portions of tissue into two separate parts during an operation. 2. a form of retractor used to open out the sides of an abdominal incision and facilitate access.

divergence n. 1. (in ophthalmology) simultaneous abduction of the eyes. Divergence excess is a divergent squint (see strabismus) in which the eyes are deviated outwards more when looking in the distance than when looking at near objects. Divergence insufficiency is a convergent squint (see strabismus) in which the eyes are deviated slightly inwards only when looking in the distance. 2. (in ethics) a difference of opinion.

diverticular disease a condition in which there are diverticula (see diverticulum) in the colon associated with symptoms. Symptoms in uncomplicated disease may include lower abdominal pain (usually left-sided) and altered stool frequency or consistency. The pain is often due to spasm of the muscle of the intestine, but other factors may be involved. The cause of the disease has historically been ascribed to low-fibre diets, but recent evidence challenges this hypothesis.

diverticulitis n. inflammation of a *diverticulum, most commonly of one or more colonic diverticula. Faecal stasis or obstruction in a colonic diverticulum predisposes to bacterial infection and ischaemia, precipitating acute inflammation. Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain and fever with or without a change in bowel habit. Blood tests reveal leucocytosis. A minority of patients may develop complications, including abscess formation, rectal bleeding, fistulae, *strictures, and peritonitis. Surgery is often required in complicated diverticulitis. Compare diverticular disease.

diverticulosis n. the presence of noninflamed diverticula (compare diverticulitis).

diverticulum n. (pl. diverticula) a sac or pouch formed at weak points in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. They may be caused by increased pressure from within (pulsion diverticula) or by pulling from without (traction diverticula). A pharyngeal diverticulum occurs in the pharynx and may cause difficulty in swallowing. Oesophageal diverticula occur in the middle or lower oesophagus (gullet); they may be associated with muscular disorders of the oesophagus but rarely cause symptoms. Gastric diverticula, which are rare, affect the stomach (usually the upper part) and cause no symptoms. Duodenal diverticula occur on the concave surface of the duodenal loop; they are usually asymptomatic but a small minority may be associated with *dyspepsia, choledocholithiasis, and an increased risk of pancreatitis. Jejunal diverticula affect the small intestine, are often multiple, and may give rise to abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea, and *malabsorption due to overgrowth of bacteria within them. Meckel’s diverticulum occurs in the ileum, about 35 cm from its termination, as a congenital abnormality. It may become inflamed, mimicking *appendicitis; if it contains embryonic remnants of stomach mucosa it may form a *peptic ulcer, causing pain, bleeding, or perforation. Colonic diverticula, affecting the colon (particularly the left side), become commoner with increasing age and often cause no symptoms. However they are sometimes associated with abdominal pain or altered bowel habit (see diverticular disease) or they may become inflamed (see diverticulitis).

division n. 1. the separation of an organ or tissue into parts by surgery. 2. see cell division.

Dix–Hallpike test (Hallpike test) a test for *benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), performed with the patient first sitting upright on an examination couch and then lying supine with the head and neck extended beyond the edge of the couch. The patient’s head is rotated to the left (or right) and supported by the examiner while the patient assumes the supine position and keeps his or her eyes focused on the examiner’s eyes. The test is then repeated with the other ear facing down. In patients with BPPV, after a short delay rotatory *nystagmus is seen, in association with severe vertigo and nausea, which gradually abates. The effect diminishes with repeated manoeuvres. In conditions affecting the cerebellum or brainstem, the nystagmus occurs immediately, in any direction, and does not diminish, and patients do not feel especially nauseated. [M. R. Dix and C. S. Hallpike (20th century), British otologists]

dizygotic twins see twins.

DLE discoid lupus erythematosus. See lupus erythematosus.

DLQI see dermatology life quality index.

DMARD see disease-modifying antirheumatic drug.

DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) see muscular dystrophy.

DMSA dimercaptosuccinic acid, which when labelled with *technetium-99m is used as a tracer to obtain *scintigrams of the kidney, by means of a *gamma camera. DMSA binds to the proximal tubules of the kidney. It is used particularly to show renal scarring, resulting from infection, and to assess the relative quantity of functioning tissue in each kidney.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) the genetic material of nearly all living organisms, which controls heredity and is located in the cell nucleus (see chromosome; gene). DNA is a *nucleic acid composed of two strands made up of units called *nucleotides (see illustration). The two strands are wound around each other into a double helix and linked together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the nucleotides (see base pairing). The genetic information of the DNA is contained in the sequence of bases along the molecule (see genetic code); changes in the DNA cause *mutations. The DNA molecule can make exact copies of itself by the process of *replication, thereby passing on the genetic information to the daughter cells when the cell divides.

DNA. Structure of part of a DNA molecule.





DNA polymerase inhibitor any one of a class of antiviral drugs that inhibit the action of DNA polymerase enzymes, which are used by viruses to form their own DNA. These drugs prevent, to a varying degree, the reproduction of viruses. They include *aciclovir, *foscarnet, *ganciclovir, and *valaciclovir.

DNA repair a variety of mechanisms that help to ensure that the genetic sequence, as expressed in the DNA, is maintained and that errors that occur during DNA replication, by mutation, are not allowed to accumulate. An error in the genetic sequence could cause cell death by interfering with the replication process. DNA repair involves the action of enzymes, which detect damage to DNA and effect the repair. Some genetic diseases, including *ataxia telangiectasia and *xeroderma pigmentosum, are due to deficiencies in these enzymes.

DNAR order Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order: an instruction, usually made by a patient while he or she has capacity and recorded in their notes, requesting that doctors desist from performing resuscitation in the event of physiological failure. By respecting a patient’s choice with regard to resuscitation, a doctor is respecting that patient’s *autonomy. If resuscitation is considered *futile, a decision not to attempt it may be taken; ideally, this should be communicated to the patient and the reasons explained sensitively.

DNAse n. an enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of DNA. A genetically engineered form, recombinant human DNAse (dornase alfa), is used in the treatment of *cystic fibrosis to reduce the viscosity of the sticky secretions in the lungs. Administered by inhalation via a jet nebulizer, it appears to hydrolyse extracellular DNA that accumulates with other neutrophil debris in the airways. Trade name: Pulmozyme.

DOAC see direct oral anticoagulant.

dobutamine n. an *inotropic *sympathomimetic drug (a β1 agonist) used to increase the force of contraction of the ventricles and improve the heart output, for example in patients who have had a *myocardial infarction or in cases of septic shock. It is given by intravenous infusion.

docetaxel n. a *taxane used in the treatment of breast cancer, advanced or metastatic *non-small-cell lung cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer that is resistant to hormonal treatment. Side-effects are as for all *cytotoxic drugs, but also typically include hypersensitivity reactions, neuropathy, and leg oedema.

Doctor n. 1. a courtesy title given to a qualified medical practitioner, i.e. one who has been registered by the *General Medical Council (GMC). Most doctors in the UK obtain bachelors’ degrees in medicine and surgery (MB, BS) or the diplomas of the conjoint boards of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of England and Scotland or the Society of Apothecaries (e.g. LRCP, MRCS, LMSSA): these degrees or diplomas are required by the GMC before a person is provisionally registered as a doctor. Normally it is also necessary to undertake training under the medical *Foundation Programme in a hospital recognized for this purpose. Such a doctor has the title foundation doctor and is debarred from independent practice. Thereafter doctors undertake further training to be eligible for full registration on the GMC’s specialist or GP registers (see Appendix 9). Surgeons in the UK do not use the title Doctor and are referred to, as a mark of distinction, as Mr, Mrs, or Ms. Qualified dentists also use the courtesy title Doctor. See also consultant. 2. the title given to a recipient of a higher university degree than a Master’s degree (this is usually a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD or DPhil) degree). The degree Medicinae Doctor (MD) is awarded by some British universities as a research degree to those with a first degree in medicine. In the US, the degree is awarded on qualification.

doctrine of double effect the principle that, where it is foreseen that a single action will have both a good and a bad outcome, a person may perform such an action provided that (a) he or she intends only the positive outcome, (b) the bad outcome is not disproportionate to the good, and (c) the good outcome is not a direct consequence of the bad. The classic example occurs where a terminally ill patient requires high doses of opiates for pain relief that may also depress respiratory function and hasten his or her death. In such a case the law holds that the doctor may supply the necessary dosage without this being considered tantamount to *euthanasia, even though the outcome will be the same, i.e. the morality of the action does not lie in its consequences (see consequentialism).

docusate sodium (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate) a stimulant *laxative and softening agent that is used to relieve constipation and prepare the bowel for radiological examination. It may cause abdominal cramps. It is also used in ear drops to soften earwax.

dolich- (dolicho-) combining form denoting long. Example: dolichocolon (abnormally long colon).

dolichocephaly n. the condition of having a relatively long narrow skull, with a *cephalic index of 75 or less. The head of a fetus in a breech presentation is often dolichocephalic. —dolichocephalic adj.

dolor n. pain: one of the classical signs of inflammation in a tissue, the other three being *calor (heat), *rubor (redness), and *tumor (swelling). The pain in inflammation is thought to be due to the release of chemicals from damaged cells.

dolorimetry n. the measurement of pain. See algesimeter.

domiciliary consultation 1. a house call by a *general practitioner made at the request of a patient or the patient’s carer. It is commonly referred to as a home visit. 2. (in Britain) an arrangement in the *National Health Service whereby a hospital specialist, at the request of a general practitioner, visits to advise on the diagnosis or treatment of a patient who, on medical grounds, is unable to attend hospital. The specialist receives special remuneration for this service.

domiciliary midwife see community midwife.

domiciliary services (in Britain) health and social services that are available in the home and are distinguished from hospital-based services. They include the services of such personnel as community nurses employed by care trusts (see district nurse; community midwife; health visitor) and social workers and care assistants employed by social service departments of local authorities. The term community services is applied to these services.

dominant adj. (in genetics) describing a gene (or its corresponding characteristic) whose effect is shown in the individual whether its *allele is the same or different. If the allele is different it is described as *recessive and its effect is masked. In genetic diseases showing autosomal dominant inheritance, the defective gene is dominant and will therefore be inherited by 50% of the offspring (of either sex) of a person with the disease. It will always be expressed in these offspring (since the normal allele inherited from the unaffected parent is recessive). —dominant n.

domperidone n. an antiemetic *prokinetic drug used especially to reduce the nausea and vomiting caused by other drugs (e.g. anticancer drugs). It inhibits the effects of *dopamine, acting to close the sphincter muscle at the upper opening of the stomach (the cardia) and to relax the sphincter at the lower opening (the pylorus). Possible side-effects include breast enlargement and pain.

donepezil n. see acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

donor n. a person who makes his own tissues or organs available for use by someone else. For example, a donor may provide blood for transfusion (see blood donor), a kidney for transplantation, or sex cells for *artificial insemination or *oocyte donation.

donor insemination see artificial insemination.

Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order see DNAR order.

door to balloon time the time in minutes between a patient with S–T elevation *myocardial infarction reaching the hospital door and inflation of a balloon or other interventional device in the occluded coronary artery. It is a key indicator of the timeliness of an emergency *percutaneous coronary intervention service.

dopa n. dihydroxyphenylalanine: a physiologically important compound that forms an intermediate stage in the synthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline) from the essential amino acid tyrosine. It also plays a role itself in the functioning of certain parts of the brain. The laevorotatory form, *levodopa, is administered for the treatment of *parkinsonism, in which there is a deficiency of the neurotransmitter *dopamine in the brain.

dopamine n. a *catecholamine derived from dopa that functions as a *neurotransmitter, acting on specific dopamine receptors and also on adrenoceptors throughout the body, especially in the *limbic system and *extrapyramidal system of the brain as well as the arteries and the heart. It also stimulates the release of noradrenaline from nerve endings. The effects vary with location and concentration. Dopamine is used in carefully controlled dosage to increase the strength of contraction of the heart in heart failure, shock, severe trauma, and septicaemia. Possible side-effects include unduly rapid or irregular heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, angina pectoris, and kidney damage.

Certain drugs (dopamine receptor agonists) have an effect on the body similar to that of dopamine. They include *apomorphine, *pergolide, *ropinirole, *cabergoline, and pramipexole and are used to treat *parkinsonism. Drugs that compete with dopamine to occupy and block the dopamine receptor sites in the body are known as dopamine receptor antagonists. They include some *antipsychotic drugs (e.g. the phenothiazines and *butyrophenones) and certain drugs (e.g. *domperidone and *metoclopramide) used to treat nausea and vomiting.

dopamine hypothesis the theory that *schizophrenia is caused in part by abnormalities in the metabolism of *dopamine and can be treated in part by drugs that antagonize its action as a neurotransmitter.

Doppler ultrasound a diagnostic technique that utilizes the fact that the frequency of sound or light waves changes when they are reflected from a moving surface (the Doppler effect). It is used to study the flow in blood vessels and the movement of blood in the heart. The frequency detector may be part of an ultrasound imaging probe, which displays an image of the anatomy on a monitor. Simultaneously the Doppler signal from a particular point on the ultrasound image can be displayed superimposed on the anatomical position (duplex imaging). Using electronic techniques, direction and velocity of blood flow can each be allocated different colours and displayed on a colour monitor over the anatomical image (colour flow ultrasound imaging). Power Doppler, a modification of this technique, is more sensitive at detecting flow but does not give information on direction of flow. Doppler ultrasound is a valuable technique to detect vessel thrombosis, such as deep vein thrombosis, and can be safely used in pregnancy without the risk of ionizing radiation. It is extensively used in vascular surgery to assess the status of the blood vessels before surgery, especially in carotid surgery. Doppler measurement of the fetal middle cerebral vessels (MCA Doppler) can predict fetal anaemia as the resistance in these vessels is increased. This noninvasive technique has supplanted serial amniocentesis/fetal cord blood sampling in cases of *haemolytic disease of the newborn. Doppler of other fetal vessels (e.g. the ductus venosus) is used as a screening method for fetal chromosomal and cardiac defects and, later, fetal growth restriction. [C. J. Doppler (1803–53), Austrian physicist]

dornase alfa n. see DNAse.

dors- (dorsi-, dorso-) combining form denoting 1. the back. Example: dorsalgia (pain in). 2. dorsal.

See radiotherapy. 2. the measurement of the dose received by a patient having a diagnostic technique involving ionizing radiation or by a radiation worker in his or her employment.

DOT directly observed therapy: see tuberculosis.

double-blind trial see intervention study.

double contrast a technique usually used in X-ray examinations of the bowel. Barium sulphate *contrast medium (first contrast) is used to coat the bowel wall. The bowel is then distended with gas (second contrast). The X-ray images obtained give exquisite detail of the lining of the gut. See also barium enema; barium swallow and meal.

double delusion the situation in which a patient (the inducer) presents with delusional symptoms that he or she believes to be shared by someone else who is incapable of expressing them (typically a child or a pet). This is different from a *delusion by proxy, in which the inducer does not claim to be experiencing the symptoms himself or herself. The term was introduced in 2015 by Peter Lepping, Mark Rishniw, and Roland Wolfgang Freudenmann. Compare folie à deux.

double J stents see stent.

double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) a congenital defect of the heart in which both the aorta and the pulmonary artery arise predominantly from the right ventricle anterior to the ventricular septum with an associated *ventricular septal defect (VSD). The relationship between the site of the VSD and the great arteries must be taken into account for surgical repair. DORV can be associated with chromosomal defects.

double uterus see uterus didelphys.

double vision see diplopia.

douche n. a stream of water used for cleaning any part of the body, most commonly the vagina. However, vaginal douching makes a woman more susceptible to infection; moreover, it is extremely unreliable as a method of contraception.

dowager’s hump curvature of the spine in the cervical (neck) and upper thoracic region (kyphosis), caused by compression fractures from osteoporosis. These fractures may be asymptomatic but when symptomatic cause significant pain. Long-term lung function may be compromised by the abnormal curvature of the spine. Compare buffalo hump.

Down’s syndrome (Down syndrome) a condition resulting from a chromosomal abnormality most commonly due to the presence of three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), which is most likely to occur with advanced maternal age. Down’s syndrome can also occur as a result of chromosomal rearrangement (*translocation) and as part of a *mosaicism, which are not related to maternal age. Affected individuals share certain clinical features, including a characteristic flat facial appearance with slanting eyes (as in Mongolian races, which gave the former name, mongolism, to the condition), broad hands with short fingers and a single crease across the palm, malformed ears, eyes with a speckled iris (Brushfield spots), short stature, and *hypotonia. Many individuals also have learning disabilities, although the range of ability is wide and some individuals are of normal intelligence. The incidence of congenital heart defects is 40–50%, and other structural malformations (e.g. *duodenal atresia) and associated abnormalities (e.g. deafness, squints, obesity, type 2 diabetes) may also be present.

*Prenatal diagnosis of Down’s syndrome can be obtained by *amniocentesis and *chorionic villus sampling, which are invasive procedures, and about 33% of structural abnormalities in fetuses with Down’s can be detected prenatally by *ultrasonography. *Prenatal screening tests (e.g. the *triple test) and soft *ultrasound markers (e.g. *nuchal translucency scanning) can estimate the risk of Down’s syndrome being present. [J. L. H. Down (1828–96), British physician]

doxapram n. an *analeptic drug used to raise the level of consciousness in patients recovering from surgery and to treat respiratory failure. Possible side-effects include nausea, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, restlessness, and tremor.

doxazosin n. an *alpha blocker used to treat high blood pressure and to relieve urinary retention due to benign enlargement of the *prostate gland. Possible side-effects include faintness on standing up, weakness, dizziness, and headache.

doxepin n. a tricyclic *antidepressant administered by mouth to relieve depression, especially when associated with anxiety; side-effects can include drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, and digestive upsets. It is also applied topically as a cream to relieve itching associated with eczema.

doxorubicin n. an *anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius caesius and used mainly in the treatment of acute leukaemias, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and various other forms of cancer. Doxorubicin acts by interfering with the production of DNA and RNA (see also cytotoxic drug; topoisomerase inhibitor). Side-effects are those of other cytotoxic drugs; in addition, cardiotoxicity increases with cumulative dose of the drug. Use of alterative anthracyclines (e.g. epirubicin) or a liposomal preparation can reduce toxicity.

doxycycline n. a *tetracycline antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Chlamydia, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, and Brucella as well as Lyme disease. It may also be used in the prevention and treatment of malaria and the treatment of mouth ulcers and periodontitis. Side-effects are those of the other tetracyclines.

DPP-IV inhibitors a group of *oral hypoglycaemic drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV they enhance the action of *glucagon-like peptide-1. Five drugs in this group are currently licensed for use in the UK: sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin.

DPT see dental pantomogram.

DPT vaccine a combined vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough (pertussis), and tetanus, the original triple vaccine used in the UK childhood immunization schedule.

dracontiasis n. a tropical disease caused by the parasitic nematode Dracunculus medinensis (see guinea worm) in the tissues beneath the skin. The disease is transmitted to humans via contaminated drinking water. The initial symptoms, which appear a year after infection, result from the migration of the worm to the skin surface and include itching, giddiness, difficulty in breathing, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Later a large blister forms on the skin, usually on the legs or arms, which eventually bursts and may ulcerate and become infected. Dracontiasis is common in India and West Africa but also occurs in Arabia, Iran, East Africa, and Afghanistan. Treatment involves extracting the worm or administering anthelmintics.

Dracunculus n. see guinea worm.

dragee n. a *pill that has been coated with sugar.

drain 1. n. a device, usually a tube or wick, used to draw fluid from an internal body cavity to the surface. A drain is sometimes inserted during an operation to ensure that any fluid formed immediately passes to the surface, so preventing an accumulation that may become infected or cause pressure in the operation site. Negative pressure (suction) can be applied through a tube drain to increase its effectiveness. Chest drains can be used in the treatment of chest trauma to drain blood (haemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) that accumulates in the pleural space. 2. vb. see drainage.

drainage n. the drawing off of fluid from a cavity in the body, usually fluid that has accumulated abnormally. For example, serous fluid may be drained from a swollen joint, pus removed from an internal abscess, or urine from an overdistended bladder. See also drain.

drastic n. any agent causing a major change in a body system or function, e.g. strong laxatives.

draw-sheet n. a sheet placed beneath a patient in bed that, when one portion has been soiled or becomes uncomfortably wrinkled, may be pulled under the patient so that another portion may be used. The bed does not have to be remade, and the patient does not have to leave bed.

drepanocyte (sickle cell) n. see sickle-cell disease.

drepanocytosis n. see sickle-cell disease.

DRESS drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: a potentially fatal reaction to medications, also called anticonvulsant and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. It is characterized by a nonspecific skin rash and variable other symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, full blood count abnormalities, organ (e.g. liver) dysfunction, and malaise. Common drug culprits include anticonvulsants and antibiotics, although many others have been reported to cause it. Prompt withdrawal of the suspected drug is critical for recovery, but sometimes the reaction can be prolonged, even after drug withdrawal.

dressing n. material applied to a wound or diseased part of the body, with or without medication, to give protection and assist healing.

drill n. (in dentistry) a rotary instrument used to remove tooth substance, particularly in the treatment of caries. It consists of a *dental handpiece that takes variously shaped *burs. Most drilling is done with an air-driven turbine handpiece, but some is performed with a much slower mechanically driven handpiece. Handpieces usually have a waterspray coolant and may have a fibre-optic light.

drip (intravenous drip) n. apparatus for the continuous infusion (*transfusion) of blood, plasma, saline, glucose solution, or other fluid into a vein. The fluid flows under gravity from a suspended bottle through a *cannula inserted into the patient’s vein. The rate of flow can be adjusted according to the rate of drips seen in a transparent section of the tube, but many *infusions are now controlled by electronically regulated infusion pumps.

drom- (dromo-) combining form denoting movement or speed.

dropsy n. see oedema.

Drosophila n. a genus of very small flies, commonly called fruit flies, that breed in decaying fruit and vegetables. D. melanogaster has been extensively used in genetic research as it has only four pairs of chromosomes and those in its salivary glands are easily recognizable. Adult D. repleta sometimes feed on faecal matter and may transmit disease organisms.

drug n. any substance that affects the structure or functioning of a living organism. Drugs are widely used for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease and for the relief of symptoms. The term ‘medicine’ is sometimes preferred for therapeutic drugs in order to distinguish them from drugs of abuse.

drug dependence see dependence.

drug-eluting stent see stent.

drug intolerance lowered threshold or heightened sensitivity to the normal pharmacological action and dosage of a drug. It is unpredictable but there is some evidence of familial history.

drusen pl. n. 1. (macular drusen) white or yellow deposits of *hyalin in *Bruch’s membrane of the choroid. They may be associated with *macular degeneration. 2. (disc drusen) glistening nodules seen on an irregularly raised *optic disc. Consisting of excess *glia (produced congenitally) that has undergone degeneration and calcification, they can be confused with *papilloedema.

DRVs see Dietary Reference Values.

dry mouth a condition that occurs as a result of reduced salivary flow from a variety of causes, including therapeutic agents, *Sjögren’s syndrome, connective‐tissue diseases, diabetes, excision or absence of a major salivary gland, or radiotherapy to the head and neck that destroys the salivary glands. It causes swallowing and speech difficulties, inflamed gums, an increased incidence of dental caries, and loss of denture stability in people who have lost their teeth. Patients with their own teeth should be given strict dietary advice, chlorhexidine or fluoride mouthwashes, and sugar-free nonacidic saliva substitutes; they require special monitoring by their dentist. Medical name: xerostomia.

dry socket (alveolar osteitis) a painful dental condition in which the normal healing of a tooth socket has been disturbed. Instead of being filled with a blood clot the socket is empty as a result of a nonspecific event; treatment consists of flushing out the socket, placement of medicated dressings, pain relief, and self-care. The condition normally resolves within 14 days.

DSDs disorders (or differences) of sexual development. See intersex.

DSEK Descemet’s stripping endothelial *keratoplasty.

DSI see digital spot imaging.

DSM Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: an influential publication of the American Psychiatric Association in which psychiatric disorders are classified and defined. The current (2013) version is DSM-5, which superseded DSM-IV-TR (2000), a text revision (TR) of the DSM-IV. DSM-5 has attracted much controversy and criticism, notably that it tends to medicalize behaviour patterns that many would consider to be normal.

DSTs see dexamethasone suppression tests.

DTaP/IPV (dTaP/IPV) a booster vaccine given to children between 3 years 4 months and 5 years of age. It tops up protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and polio.

DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB a primary *immunization given to infants typically at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. It protects against six diseases: diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (whooping cough) acellular component (aP), polio (inactivated polio vaccine) IPV, Haemophilus influenzae type b infection (Hib) (see Hib vaccine), and Hepatitis B (HepB).

DTPA diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, which when labelled with *technetium-99m is used as a tracer to obtain *scintigrams of the kidney over a period of time, by means of a *gamma camera. DTPA is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and passes into the urine; it is used to show the function of the kidney and reflux from the bladder up the ureter. It is particularly useful in assessing obstruction to urinary drainage from the kidneys.

dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) aspirin prescribed at the same time as another oral *antiplatelet drug (e.g. clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) for patients deemed to be at temporarily increased risk of coronary or stent thrombosis (typically following *acute coronary syndrome or new coronary stent implantation). After a prespecified time (usually 12 months), the aspirin is continued and the other antiplatelet drug is stopped.

dual diagnosis the coexistence of a severe mental disorder with a *substance misuse disorder.

Duane’s syndrome an abnormality of the eye muscles leading most commonly to restricted abduction (outward movement of the eye away from the midline) of one eye. On attempted adduction (inward movement of the eye towards the midline) of that same eye there is retraction of the eye into the orbit and narrowing of the opening between the eyelids. [A. Duane (1858–1926), US ophthalmologist]

Duchenne muscular dystrophy see muscular dystrophy. [G. B. A. Duchenne (1806–75), French neurologist]

ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) the earliest stage of breast cancer, detectable by mammography, which is confined to the lactiferous (milk) ducts of the breast. See carcinoma in situ.

ductions pl. n. movements of one eye, i.e. adduction (rotation towards the nose), abduction (rotation towards the temple), elevation, depression, intorsion, and extorsion.

ductless gland see endocrine gland.

ductule n. a small duct or channel.

ductus n. a duct. The ductus deferens is the *vas deferens.

ductus arteriosus a blood vessel in the fetus connecting the pulmonary artery directly to the ascending aorta, so bypassing the pulmonary circulation. It normally closes after birth. Failure of the ductus to close (patent ductus arteriosus) produces a continuous *murmur, and the consequences are similar to those of a *septal defect. It may close spontaneously in childhood but often requires surgical closure.

ductus venosus a blood vessel in the fetus that conveys oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava and right atrium, where it passes through the *foramen ovale to the left atrium and left ventricle.

Dukes’ staging a widely accepted histological classification of the extent of tumours of the colon and rectum, which is useful for prognosis. There have been modifications to the original classification. [Sir C. Dukes (1890–1977), British pathologist]

duloxetine n. see SNRI.

dumbness n. see mutism.

Dumdum fever see kala-azar.

dumping syndrome a syndrome that may occur following operations on the stomach, particularly *gastrectomy (postgastrectomy syndrome), due to the precipitous transit of ingested food into the small intestine. In early dumping, debilitating symptoms start within 30 minutes of the meal; they include abdominal cramps, flushing, sweating, diarrhoea, and palpitations. Late dumping syndrome occurs 1–2 hours after a meal and relates to hypoglycaemia. The patient may feel faint, weak, and nauseous, has a rapid pulse, and may sweat and become pale. Avoidance of large carbohydrate meals and having small but frequent meals (six a day) may relieve the symptoms but further surgery is sometimes required.

Duncan disease see X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. [Duncan family, in whom the disease was first studied]

duo- combining form denoting two.

duoden- (duodeno-) combining form denoting the duodenum. Example: duodenectomy (excision of).

duodenal atresia a condition in which there is congenital narrowing of the duodenum causing complete obstruction. It presents at birth with vomiting, which is usually bile-stained, and is associated with other congenital abnormalities, particularly *Down’s syndrome. Treatment is by restoration of any fluid and electrolyte loss followed by surgical repair.

duodenal ulcer an ulcer in the duodenum, caused by the action of acid and pepsin on the duodenal lining (mucosa) of a susceptible individual. It is usually associated with an increased output of stomach acid. Infection of the *antrum of the stomach with *Helicobacter pylori is almost always present. Other causes include ingestion of aspirin or other *NSAIDs. Symptoms include chronic episodic pain in the upper abdomen, especially when the stomach is empty; vomiting occurs infrequently. Complications include bleeding (see haematemesis), *perforation, and obstruction due to scarring (see pyloric stenosis). Bleeding ulcers may be amenable to endoscopic therapy. Symptoms are relieved by antacid medicines; most ulcers heal if treated by an *antisecretory drug. H. pylori infection requires a combination of a *proton-pump inhibitor (or an H2-receptor antagonist) and two different antibiotics over a 7-day period. Surgery (see gastrectomy; vagotomy) is now rarely required.

duodenitis n. inflammation of the duodenum. Duodenitis is commonly caused by infection with *Helicobacter pylori, NSAIDs, smoking, and alcohol. Clinical symptoms are nonspecific (vague abdominal discomfort may be present), or the findings of duodenal inflammation may be noted at gastroscopy in an asymptomatic patient. Treatment may include antibiotics for H. pylori infection, antisecretory agents, and the withdrawal of implicated drugs (such as diclofenac).

duodenoscope n. a fibreoptic or video instrument for examining the interior of the duodenum. A side-viewing duodenoscope allows direct visualization of the duodenal ampulla and is used in performing *ERCP.

duodenostomy n. an operation, now rarely performed, in which the duodenum is brought through the abdominal wall and opened, usually in order to introduce food. See also gastroduodenostomy.

duodenum n. the first of the three parts of the small *intestine. It extends from the pylorus of the stomach to the jejunum. The duodenum receives bile from the gall bladder (via the common bile duct) and pancreatic juice from the pancreas. Its wall contains various glands (including *Brunner’s glands) that secrete an alkaline juice, rich in mucus, that protects the duodenum from the effects of the acidic *chyme passing from the stomach. —duodenal adj.

duplex imaging see Doppler ultrasound.

Dupuytren’s contracture a flexion deformity of the fingers (usually the ring and little fingers) caused by a nodular *hypertrophy and *contracture of the *fascia in the palm. The characteristic sign is a nodule at the distal palmar crease or over the proximal phalanx of the finger. The condition is treated by surgical excision of the contracted and thickened tissue. Dupuytren’s contracture may be associated with excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, repetitive hand use, or vibratory trauma. [Baron G. Dupuytren (1777–1835), French surgeon]

dura (dura mater, pachymeninx) n. the thickest and outermost of the three *meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It consists of two closely adherent layers, the outer of which is identical with the periosteum of the skull. The inner dura extends downwards between the cerebral hemispheres to form the falx cerebri and forwards between the cerebrum and cerebellum to form the tentorium. A thin film of fluid (not cerebrospinal fluid) separates the inner dura from the arachnoid.

dural adj. of, relating to, or affecting the *dura.

dutasteride n. a drug used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland). It is a 5α-reductase inhibitor, which blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It has the same side-effects as *finasteride.

duty n. what is owed to another person, creating an obligation or moral requirement to behave in one way rather than another. Duty may arise from rules or principles, such as the *four principles of medical ethics, or from particular relationships (e.g. doctor and patient or parent and child). Dilemmas may arise where these duties appear to conflict or are unclearly delineated. The idea of duty as an absolute *imperative that does not vary with circumstances is central to the tradition of *Kantian ethics (see deontology). Doctors also have legal duties towards their patients because of their *fiduciary relationship and assume a duty of care as soon as they start a consultation. If doctors, registered nurses, or other health professionals fall short of their legal duty of care, they may be subject to a claim of *negligence.

DVD see dissociated vertical deviation.

DVT (deep vein thrombosis) see phlebothrombosis.

dwarfism n. abnormally short stature from any cause. The most common type is achondroplastic dwarfism (see achondroplasia). Pituitary dwarfism results from a deficiency of *growth hormone due to a defect in the pituitary gland; people with this type of dwarfism are well proportioned. Primordial dwarfism is due to a genetic defect in the response to growth hormone. Dwarfism may also be associated with thyroid deficiency (see cretinism), in which both physical and mental development are arrested; chronic diseases such as rickets; renal failure; and intestinal malabsorption.

dydrogesterone n. a synthetic female sex hormone (see progestogen) used (in conjunction with estradiol) in hormone replacement therapy. It may cause mild nausea and breakthrough bleeding.

dying n. the end stage of every person’s life, lasting often for several days before the actual *death. Having a duty to save life, clinicians may fail to notice the moment when death becomes inevitable and they must now provide the care appropriate for a dying patient. This point is recognized by a change in demeanour, social involvement, and even vital signs, and in some cases the patient may tell (or try to tell) others, including professional carers, that this is happening. In the best care, after the physician recognizes the patient’s state, treatments that may be burdensome are stopped and replaced by those that may benefit someone dying: symptom relief is the key factor. See also hospice; palliative.

dynamic splintage a technique that retains the essentials of splinting but allows some controlled movement of the restrained body part.

dynamometer n. a device for recording the force of a muscular contraction. A small hand-held dynamometer may be used to record the strength of a patient’s grip. A special optical dynamometer measures the action of the muscles controlling the shape of the lens of the eye.

dyne n. a unit of force equal to the force required to impart to a mass of 1 gram an acceleration of 1 centimetre per second per second. 1 dyne = 10−5 newton.

-dynia combining form denoting pain. Example: proctodynia (in the rectum).

dys- prefix denoting difficult, abnormal, or impaired. Examples: dysbasia (difficulty in walking); dysgeusia (impairment of taste).

dysaesthesia n. the abnormal and sometimes unpleasant sensation felt by a patient with partial damage to sensory nerve fibres when the skin is stimulated. Compare paraesthesia.

dysarthria n. a speech disorder in which the pronunciation is unclear although the language content and meaning are normal.

dysbarism n. any clinical syndrome due to a difference between the atmospheric pressure outside the body and the pressure of air or gas within a body cavity (such as the paranasal sinuses or the middle ear). See compressed air illness.

dyscalculia n. a developmental disorder in which a child’s ability to learn arithmetical facts and to process and manipulate numbers is significantly below normal for his or her age. Like *dyslexia, with which it is associated, it is not caused by intellectual impairment.

dyschezia n. a form of constipation resulting from a long period of voluntary suppression of the urge to defecate. The rectum becomes distended with faeces and bowel movements are difficult or painful.

dyschondroplasia (Ollier’s disease) n. a condition due to faulty ossification of cartilage, resulting in development of many benign cartilaginous tumours (see chondroma). The bones involved may become stunted and deformed. There is an increased risk of developing malignant tumours (see chondrosarcoma).

dyschromatopsia n. any defect of colour vision.

dyscoria n. any abnormality in the shape of the pupil.

dyscrasia n. an abnormal state of the body or part of the body, especially one due to abnormal development or metabolism. In classical medicine the term was used for the imbalance of the four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile), which was believed to be the basic cause of all diseases.

dysdiadochokinesis (adiadochokinesis) n. clumsiness in performing rapidly alternating movements. It is often recognized by asking the patient to tap alternately between the front and back of one hand and the back of the other hand. Impairment of this task is indicative of disease of the cerebellum or its intracerebral connections.

dysentery n. an infection of the intestinal tract that causes severe diarrhoea with blood and mucus. Amoebic dysentery (amoebiasis) is caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica and results in intestinal ulceration (amoebic colitis) and occasionally abscesses in the liver (amoebic or tropical abscesses), lungs, testes, or brain. The parasite is spread by food or water contaminated by infected faeces. Symptoms appear days or even years after infection and include diarrhoea, indigestion, loss of weight, and anaemia. Prolonged treatment with drugs, including metronidazole, is usually effective in treating the condition. Amoebic dysentery is mainly confined to tropical and subtropical countries.

Bacillary dysentery is caused by bacteria of the genus Shigella and is spread by contact with a patient or carrier or through contaminated food or water. Epidemics are common in overcrowded, insanitary conditions. Symptoms develop 1–6 days after infection and persist for up to 2 weeks; they include diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal cramping, and fever. An attack may vary from mild diarrhoea to states of severe dehydration and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. In most cases, provided fluid losses are replaced, recovery occurs within 7–10 days; antibiotics may be given to eliminate the bacteria. Compare cholera.

dysfunctional uterine bleeding see menorrhagia.

dysgenesis n. faulty development. Gonadal dysgenesis is failure of the ovaries or testes to develop (see Turner’s syndrome).

dysgerminoma (germinoma, gonocytoma) n. a malignant tumour of the ovary, thought to arise from primitive germ cells; it is homologous to the *seminoma of the testis. About 15% of such tumours affect both ovaries; outside the ovary they have been recorded in the anterior mediastinum and in the pineal gland. Dysgerminomas may occur from infancy to old age, but the average age of patients is about 20 years. Treatment is by oophorectomy, with chemotherapy for residual disease.

dysgraphia n. see agraphia.

dyshormonogenesis n. a collection of inherited disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis resulting in low levels of *thyroxine and *triiodothyronine and high levels of *thyroid-stimulating hormone, with consequent *goitre formation. The result may be *cretinism with a goitre or milder forms of *hypothyroidism with a goitre. Several different stages of the production pathway for thyroid hormones can be affected.

dyskaryosis n. the abnormal condition of a cell that has a nucleus showing the features characteristic of the earliest stage of malignancy, while retaining relatively normal cytoplasm. It may be seen, for example, in the squamous and columnar epithelial cells of a cervical smear (see cervical screening).

dyskinesia n. a group of involuntary movements that appear to be a fragmentation of the normal smoothly controlled limb and facial movements. They include *chorea, *dystonia, *athetosis, and those involuntary movements occurring as side-effects to the use of levodopa and the phenothiazines (see tardive dyskinesia).

dyslexia n. a developmental disorder selectively affecting a child’s ability to learn to read and write. The condition affects boys more often than girls and can create serious educational problems. It is sometimes called specific dyslexia, developmental reading disorder, or developmental word blindness to distinguish it from acquired difficulties with reading and writing. Compare alexia. —dyslexic adj.

dysmenorrhoea n. menstruation that is associated with cramping low abdominal pain radiating into the lower back and thighs; the pain sometimes precedes menstrual flow. In primary dysmenorrhoea the painful periods begin soon after *menarche and are associated with increased production of *prostaglandin F2α by the endometrium. Secondary dysmenorrhoea is caused by organic pelvic disease, such as fibroids or endometriosis.

dysmetria n. impaired coordination due to disorders of the cerebellum or its connections within the brainstem. In the *finger–nose test, the patient’s finger over- or undershoots or passes the target because of failure to control the movement accurately.

dysmnesic syndrome a disorder of memory in which new information is not learned but old material is well remembered. See Korsakoff’s syndrome.

dysmorphic adj. describing a body characteristic that is abnormally formed. A dysmorphic feature can be a minor isolated feature, such a *clinodactyly, or it may be found in association with other features in more serious syndromes, such as *Down’s syndrome.

dysmorphology n. the study of *malformations during embryogenesis.

dysmorphophobia see body dysmorphic disorder.

dysostosis n. the abnormal formation of bone or the formation of bone in abnormal places, such as a replacement of cartilage by bone.

dyspareunia n. painful sexual intercourse experienced by a woman. It may be related to *vaginismus or caused by underlying disease, such as endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. See apareunia.

dyspepsia (indigestion) n. disordered digestion: usually applied to pain or discomfort in the lower chest or upper abdomen after eating and sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of unease or fullness after eating. —dyspeptic adj.

dysphagia n. difficulty in swallowing secondary to either mechanical obstruction or neurological disease. It can be caused by obstruction of the oropharynx or oesophagus by disease (for example, oesophageal carcinoma) or by neurological impairment of the coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Such disorders include motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. A patient may describe food sticking at the level of the sternum in oesophageal dysphagia (compare odynophagia).

dysphasia n. see aphasia.

dysphonia n. difficulty in voice production. This may be due to a disorder of the larynx, pharynx, tongue, or mouth, or it may be *psychogenic. Compare dysarthria; aphasia.

dysplasia (alloplasia, heteroplasia) n. a premalignant condition characterized by abnormal development of epithelium, bone, or other tissues. See also bronchopulmonary dysplasia; fibrous dysplasia. —dysplastic adj.

dysplastic kidneys any developmental abnormalities resulting from anomalous metanephric differentiation (see metanephros). Most dysplastic kidneys are associated either with an abnormally located ureteral orifice or with urinary tract anomalies that are expected to produce unilateral, bilateral, or segmental urinary obstruction.

dyspnoea n. laboured or difficult breathing. (The term is often used for a sign of laboured breathing apparent to the doctor, breathlessness being used for the subjective feeling of laboured breathing.) Dyspnoea can be due to obstruction to the flow of air into and out of the lungs (as in bronchitis and asthma), various diseases affecting the tissue of the lung (including pneumoconiosis, emphysema, tuberculosis, and cancer), and heart disease.

dyspraxia n. see apraxia.

dyssocial adj. see antisocial personality disorder.

dysthymia n. a permanent state of mildly lowered mood. This never reaches the severity of clinical *depression but it can impair the person’s quality of life. It is often associated with *emotionally unstable personality disorder. Treatment options include *psychotherapy and *SSRIs in high doses. —dysthymic adj.

dystocia n. difficult birth, caused by abnormalities in the fetus or the mother (see obstructed labour). Dystocia may arise due to uterine *inertia, which is more common in a first labour; abnormal fetal lie or presentation; absolute or relative *cephalopelvic disproportion; or (rarely) a massive fetal tumor, such as a sacrococcygeal teratoma. Synthetic oxytocin (Syntocinon) is commonly used to treat uterine inertia. However, pregnancies complicated by dystocia often end with assisted deliveries, including forceps, ventouse, or (commonly) Caesarean section. See also shoulder dystocia.

dystonia n. muscle dysfunction characterized by spasms or abnormal muscle contraction. One form is a postural disorder often associated with disease of the *basal ganglia in the brain. There may be spasm in the muscles of the face (see hemifacial spasm), shoulders, neck, trunk, and limbs; the arm is often held in a rotated position and the head may be drawn back and to one side. Other forms of dystonia include *torticollis, *blepharospasm, and writer’s *cramp. Dystonic conditions, including blepharospasm, may be helped by the injection of *botulinum toxin. —dystonic adj.

dystrophia myotonica (myotonic dystrophy) a type of *muscular dystrophy in which the muscle weakness and wasting is accompanied by an unnatural prolongation of the muscular contraction after any voluntary effort (see myotonia). The muscles of the face, temples, and neck are especially wasted. Baldness, endocrine malfunction, and cataracts also occur. The disease can affect both sexes (it is inherited as an autosomal *dominant disorder). Genetic testing for mutations in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene is possible.

dystrophic calcification the calcification of injured or necrotic tissue in the absence of systemic *hypercalcaemia. Dystrophic calcification is a characteristic feature in some cancers of the breast, ovary, and thyroid gland. Compare metastatic calcification.

dystrophy (dystrophia) n. a disorder of an organ or tissue, usually muscle, due to impaired nourishment of the affected part. The term is applied to several unrelated conditions; for example, *muscular dystrophy, *Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy, and dystrophia adiposogenitalis (see Fröhlich’s syndrome).

dysuria n. difficult or painful urination. This is usually associated with urgency and frequency of urination if due to *cystitis or *urethritis. The pain is burning in nature and is relieved by curing the underlying cause. A high fluid intake usually helps.

Eagle–Barrett syndrome see prune belly syndrome.

Eales’ disease inflammation of the blood vessels of the retina occurring in young adults. It is characterized by leakage from abnormal growths of new vessels as well as recurrent haemorrhages into the vitreous humour. [H. Eales (1852–1913), British physician]

ear n. the sense organ concerned with hearing and balance (see illustration). Sound waves, transmitted from the outside into the external auditory meatus, cause the eardrum (tympanic membrane) to vibrate. The small bones (ossicles) of the middle ear – the malleus, incus, and stapes – transmit the sound vibrations to the fenestra ovalis, which leads to the inner ear (see labyrinth). Inside the *cochlea the sound vibrations are converted into nerve impulses. Vibrations emerging from the cochlea could cause pressure to build up inside the ear, but this is released through the *Eustachian tube. The *semicircular canals, *saccule, and *utricle – also in the inner ear – are all concerned with balance.

Structure of the ear.





earache n. see otitis; otalgia.

eardrum n. see tympanic membrane.

ear-lobe creases diagonal creases across the ear lobes, which have a statistically significant correlation with coronary atheroma. The reason is unknown.

early neonatal death see perinatal mortality rate.

early warning system (EWS) a system to detect deteriorating patients on the ward. Certain physical parameters are accorded scores: the higher the scores for individual patients, the greater the deterioration in their condition. Parameters scored include blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness. Adjustments can be made for increased age.

earwax n. see cerumen.

Ebola virus a virus responsible for an acute infection in humans with features similar to those of *Marburg disease. Transmission is by contact with infected blood and other body fluids and the incubation period is 2–21 days (7 days on average). The mortality rate is 53–88%, but intensive treatment (including rehydration) in the early stages of the disease can halt its rapid and usually irreversible progression to haemorrhaging of internal organs. Until recently, sporadic but short-lived outbreaks have occurred in Africa since 1976, when the virus was first identified during an outbreak in the region of the Ebola river, in Zaïre (now Democratic Republic of Congo). A major epidemic of the disease broke out in West Africa at the end of 2013 and lasted until May 2016: over 11,000 people died. An unknown species of animal – possibly a fruit bat – is assumed to act as a reservoir for the virus between outbreaks of the disease in humans.

Ebstein’s anomaly a form of congenital heart disease affecting the right side of the heart: the tricuspid valve is displaced towards the apex to a varying extent, resulting in impaired right ventricular function. It can cause breathlessness, *failure to thrive, cyanosis, and abnormalities of heart rhythm, although if mild it may be asymptomatic. If mild, life expectancy is normal. If severe, corrective surgery may be necessary. [W. Ebstein (1836–1912), German physician]

eburnation n. the wearing down of the cartilage at the articulating surface of a bone, exposing the underlying bone and leading to bone sclerosis, in which the bone’s surface becomes dense and smooth like ivory. This is an end result of *osteoarthritis.

EBV (EB virus) see Epstein–Barr virus.

ec- prefix denoting out of or outside.

ecbolic n. an agent, such as *oxytocin, that induces childbirth by stimulating contractions of the uterus.

ecchondroma n. (pl. ecchondromata) a benign cartilaginous tumour (see chondroma) that protrudes beyond the margins of a bone. Compare enchondroma.

ecchymosis n. a *bruise: an initially bluish-black mark on the skin, resulting from the release of blood into the tissues either through injury or through the spontaneous leaking of blood from the vessels (as in some blood diseases).

eccrine adj. 1. describing sweat glands that are distributed all over the body. Their ducts open directly onto the surface of the skin and they are densest on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. Compare apocrine. 2. see merocrine.

ecdemic adj. not occurring normally in the population of a country: applied sometimes to unusual diseases brought in from abroad by immigrants or travellers. Compare endemic.

ecdysis n. the act of shedding skin; *desquamation.

ECG n. see electrocardiogram.

echinococciasis (echinococcosis) n. see hydatid disease.

Echinococcus n. a genus of small parasitic tapeworms that reach a maximum length of only 8 mm. Adults are found in the intestines of dogs, wolves, or jackals. If the eggs are swallowed by a human, who can act as a secondary host, the resulting larvae penetrate the intestine and settle in the lungs, liver, or brain to form large cysts, usually 5–10 cm in diameter (see hydatid disease). Two species causing this condition are E. granulosus and E. multilocularis.

echinocyte n. see burr cell.

echoacousia n. a false sensation of echoing after normally heard sound owing to a defect of the cochlea in the inner ear.

echocardiography n. the use of *ultrasound waves to investigate and display the action of the heart as it beats. Used in the diagnosis and assessment of congenital and acquired heart diseases, it is safe, painless, and reliable and reduces the need for cardiac *catheterization. M-mode echocardiography uses a single beam of ultrasound. The image produced is not anatomical but permits precise measurement of cardiac dimensions and the diagnosis of valvular, myocardial, and pericardial disease. 2-D echocardiography uses a pulsed array of ultrasound beams to build up a moving image on a TV monitor of the chambers and valves of the heart. In Doppler echocardiography ultrasound reflected from moving red blood cells is subject to the Doppler effect (change of frequency with velocity relative to the observer), which can be used to calculate blood flow and pressure within the heart and great vessels. It is useful in the diagnosis and assessment of valve disease and intracardiac shunts. In transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) the ultrasound probe is mounted on an oesophageal endoscope. The examination from within the oesophagus allows the probe to be placed directly against the back of the heart, which enables improved visualization of the posterior structures.

echo de la pensée see thought echo.

echolalia n. pathological repetition of the words spoken by another person. It may be a symptom of language disorders, *autism, severe mental illness (e.g. catatonic schizophrenia), dementia, or *Tourette’s syndrome.

echopraxia pathological imitation of the actions of another person. It may be a symptom of *catatonia or of *latah. It is sometimes called echokinesis.

echovirus n. one of a group of about 30 RNA-containing viruses, originally isolated from the human intestinal tract, that were found to produce pathological changes in cells grown in culture, although they were not clearly associated with any specific disease. These viruses – which were accordingly termed enteric cytopathic human orphan viruses – are now more commonly known as *Coxsackie viruses. Compare reovirus.

eclabium n. the turning outward of a lip.

eclampsia n. the occurrence of one or more convulsions not caused by other conditions, such as epilepsy or cerebral haemorrhage, in a woman with *pre-eclampsia. The onset of convulsions may be preceded by a sudden rise in blood pressure and/or a sudden increase in *oedema and development of *oliguria. The convulsions are usually followed by coma. Eclampsia is a threat to the life of both mother and baby and must be treated immediately.

ECMO see extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

ECoG see electrocochleography.

ecology (bionomics) n. the study of the relationships between humans, plants and animals, and the environment, including the way in which human activities may affect other animal populations and alter natural surroundings. —ecological adj. —ecologist n.

econazole n. an antifungal drug used to treat ringworm and candidiasis. Possible side-effects may include local irritation and burning.

ecraseur n. a surgical device, resembling a *snare, that is used to sever the base of a tumour during its surgical removal.

ecstasy n. a sense of extreme wellbeing and bliss. The word applies particularly to *trance states dominated by religious thinking. While not necessarily pathological, it can be caused by epilepsy (especially of the temporal lobe) or by *schizophrenia or *mania.

Ecstasy n. the street name for methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a mildly hallucinogenic drug that generates feelings of euphoria in those who take it. Its most common side-effect is hyperthermia; drinking large quantities of water to combat the intense thirst produced by taking the drug may result in fatal damage to the body’s fluid balance. Its manufacture, sale, use, and possession are illegal.

ECT see electroconvulsive therapy.

ect- (ecto-) combining form denoting outer or external.

ectasia (ectasis) n. the dilatation of a tube, duct, or hollow organ.

ecthyma n. an infection of the skin caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and other bacteria. The full thickness of the epidermis is involved (compare impetigo, which is a superficial infection). Ecthyma heals slowly and causes scarring. It may be associated with poor hygiene or depressed immunity.

ectoderm n. the outer of the three *germ layers of the early embryo. It gives rise to the nervous system and sense organs, the teeth and lining of the mouth, and to the *epidermis and its associated structures (hair, nails, etc.). —ectodermal adj.

ectomorphic adj. describing a *body type that is relatively thin, with a large skin surface in comparison to weight. —ectomorph n. —ectomorphy n.

-ectomy combining form denoting surgical removal of a segment or all of an organ or part. Examples: appendicectomy (of the appendix); prostatectomy (of the prostate gland).

ectoparasite n. a parasite that lives on the outer surface of its host. Some ectoparasites, such as bed bugs, maintain only periodic contact with their hosts, whereas others, such as the crab louse, have a permanent association. Compare endoparasite.

ectopia n. 1. the misplacement, due either to a congenital defect or injury, of a bodily part. 2. the occurrence of something in an unnatural location (see also ectopic beat; ectopic pregnancy). —ectopic adj.

ectopic beat (extrasystole) a heartbeat due to an impulse generated somewhere in the heart outside the sinoatrial node. Ectopic beats are generally premature in timing; they are classified as supraventricular if they originate in the atria and ventricular if they arise from a focus in the ventricles. They may be produced by any heart disease, by nicotine from smoking, or by caffeine from excessive tea or coffee consumption; they are common in normal individuals. The patient may be unaware of their presence or may feel that his heart has ‘missed a beat’. Ectopic beats may be suppressed by drugs such as quinidine, propranolol, and lidocaine; avoidance of smoking and reduction in excessive tea or coffee intake may help. See arrhythmia.

ectopic hormone a hormone produced by cells that do not usually produce it. Some tumour cells secrete hormones; for example, small-cell lung cancer cells secrete antidiuretic hormone and cause *hyponatraemia.

ectopic pregnancy (extrauterine pregnancy) the implantation of a fertilized egg cell at a site outside the uterus. This may happen if the fertilized egg cell remains in the ovary or in the Fallopian tube or if it lodges in the free abdominal cavity. The most common type of ectopic pregnancy is a tubal pregnancy, which occurs in Fallopian tubes that become blocked or inflamed. The growth of the fetus may cause the tube to rupture and bleed, causing severe haemorrhage. Early detection of the condition (e.g. by monitoring serum *human chorionic gonadotrophin and *transvaginal ultrasonography) allows conservative treatment in many cases; medical treatment (with methotrexate), which preserves fertility, may also be possible. Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred surgical treatment.

ectoplasm n. the outer layer of cytoplasm in cells, which is denser than the inner cytoplasm (*endoplasm) and concerned with activities such as cell movement. —ectoplasmic adj.

ectro- combining form denoting congenital absence.

ectrodactyly n. congenital absence of all or part of one or more fingers.

ectromelia n. congenital absence or gross shortening (aplasia) of the long bones of one or more limbs. See also amelia; hemimelia; phocomelia.

ectropion n. 1. turning out of the eyelid, away from the eyeball. The commonest type is senile ectropion, in which the lower eyelid droops because of laxity of the eyelid in old age. If the muscle that closes the eye (orbicularis oculi) is paralysed the lower lid also droops. Ectropion may also occur if scarring causes contraction of the surrounding facial skin. 2. (cervical ectopy) the replacement of the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the vaginal part of the cervix (ectocervix) by columnar epithelium, which has migrated from the *endocervix. As a result, the junction of squamous and columnar epithelia does not coincide with the opening of the cervix into the uterus. Cervical ectropion is caused by exposure to higher levels of oestrogen, which occurs normally at certain times (e.g. at puberty or in pregnancy) or with *anovulation. It usually causes no symptoms but in a few cases may be associated with postcoital bleeding and a mucoid vaginal discharge.

eczema n. a common itchy skin disease characterized by reddening (*erythema) and vesicle formation, which may lead to weeping and crusting. It is endogenous, or constitutional, i.e. outside agents do not play a primary role (compare dermatitis), but in some contexts the terms ‘dermatitis’ and ‘eczema’ are used interchangeably. There are five main types: (1) atopic eczema, which affects up to 20% of the population and is associated with asthma and hay fever; (2) seborrhoeic eczema (or seborrhoeic dermatitis), which involves the scalp, eyelids, nose, and lips, is associated with the presence of Malassezia yeasts and may also be seen in HIV infection; (3) discoid (or nummular) eczema, which is characterized by coin-shaped lesions and occurs in adults, especially on the limbs; (4) *pompholyx, affecting the palms and soles; (5) gravitational (or stasis) eczema, associated with poor venous circulation and incorrectly known as varicose eczema.

Treatment of eczema is with regular emollients and topical corticosteroids. Other treatments include topical *calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, and systemic immunosuppressants. There is emerging evidence that effective treatment of eczema helps to reduce the risk of subsequently developing asthma and hay fever. —eczematous adj.

eczema herpeticum (Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption) a skin eruption, typically in children or young adults, of widespread *vesicles and ulcers caused by *herpes simplex. This is due to impaired barrier function in skin with eczema. Clinical features include fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Rarely, the infection may become systemic and be life-threatening. Eczema herpeticum is commonly misdiagnosed as a bacterial infection. Treatment is with systemic antivirals and hospitalization may be required.

ED emergency department, also known as A & E (accident and emergency department): a hospital department that assesses and deals with the immediate problems of acutely ill and injured patients. See also A & E medicine.

edentulous adj. lacking teeth: usually applied to people who have lost some or all of their teeth.

edetate n. a salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is used as a *chelating agent in the treatment of poisoning. Dicobalt edetate is an antidote to cyanide, administered as soon as possible after poisoning. Sodium calcium edetate is used to treat poisoning by heavy metals, especially lead.

edrophonium n. an *anticholinesterase drug that is used after surgery to reverse the effects of nondepolarizing *muscle relaxants and in a test for diagnosis of *myasthenia gravis. Side-effects can include nausea and vomiting, increased saliva flow, diarrhoea, and stomach pains.

EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) see edetate.

Edwards’ syndrome a condition resulting from a genetic abnormality in which an extra chromosome is present – there are three no. 18 chromosomes instead of the usual two. Affected babies, who rarely survive, have a characteristic abnormally shaped head, low birth weight, prominent heels (‘rocker-bottom feet’), heart abnormalities, and severe learning disabilities. Prenatal screening (by *nuchal translucency scanning) and diagnosis (by *amniocentesis or *chorionic villus sampling) are possible. [J. H. Edwards (1928–2007), British geneticist]

EECP see enhanced external counterpulsation.

EEG (electroencephalogram) see electroencephalography.

EF see ejection fraction.

effectiveness and efficiency n. measures that are used in health economics and ethics to assess treatments of all kinds. A treatment that works or achieves its object is effective, but may do so at great cost. If it is also efficient, it achieves its aim equally but at lower cost (or consumes less resources) when compared with other treatments. Such an assessment may be part of an *intervention study. Even apparently effective and efficient treatments may work for patients only by depriving others of similar care (opportunity costs), so a moral evaluation must take into account the overall aims and purposes of health care in general.

effector n. any structure or agent that brings about activity in a muscle or gland, such as a motor nerve that causes muscular contraction or glandular secretion. The term is also used for the muscle or gland itself.

efferent adj. 1. designating nerves or neurons that convey impulses from the brain or spinal cord to muscles, glands, and other effectors; i.e. any motor nerve or neuron. 2. designating vessels or ducts that drain fluid (such as lymph) from an organ or part. Compare afferent.

effleurage n. a form of *massage in which the hands are passed continuously and rhythmically over a patient’s skin in one direction only, with the aim of increasing blood flow in that direction and aiding the dispersal of any swelling due to *oedema.

effusion n. 1. the escape of pus, serum, blood, lymph, or other fluid into a body cavity as a result of inflammation or the presence of excess blood or tissue fluid in an organ or tissue. 2. fluid that has escaped into a body cavity. Such effusions may be exudates (rich in protein) or transudates (low in protein).

eformoterol n. see formoterol.

eGFR estimated *glomerular filtration rate. Most estimates in clinical practice are based on the serum creatinine, age, gender, and race, with or without body weight Examples are the *Cockcroft-Gault formula and MDRD eGFR (modification of diet in renal disease study method of estimating glomerular filtration rate).

EGFR see epidermal growth factor receptor.

egg cell see ovum.

egg donation see oocyte donation.

ego n. (in psychoanalysis) the part of the mind that develops from a person’s experience of the outside world and is most in touch with external realities. In Freudian terms the ego is said to reconcile the demands of the *id (the instinctive unconscious mind), the *superego (moral conscience), and reality.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome any one of a rare group of inherited (autosomal *dominant or autosomal *recessive) disorders of the connective tissue involving abnormal or deficient *collagen, the protein that gives the body tissues strength. There are several types of differing severity. The skin of affected individuals is very elastic but also very fragile: it bruises easily and scars poorly, the scars often being paper-thin. The joints of those affected tend to be very mobile (double-jointed) and dislocate easily. In some types the uterus or bowel can rupture or the valves in the heart can be weaker than normal. [E. L. Ehlers (1863–1937), Danish dermatologist; H. A. Danlos (1844–1912), French dermatologist]

EHS see exploding head syndrome.

eidetic adj. see imagery.

eikonometer n. an instrument for measuring the size of images on the retina of the eye.

Eisenmenger reaction (Eisenmenger syndrome) a condition in which *pulmonary hypertension is associated with a *septal defect, so that blood flows from the right to the left side of the heart or from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. This allows blue blood, poor in oxygen, to bypass the lungs and enter the general circulation. This reduces the oxygen content of the arterial blood in the aorta and its branches, resulting in a patient with a dusky blue appearance (*cyanosis) and an increased number of red blood cells (*polycythaemia). There is no curative treatment at this stage, but the patient may be helped by the control of heart failure and polycythaemia. The condition may be prevented by appropriate treatment of the septal defect in early childhood before irreversible pulmonary hypertension develops. [V. Eisenmenger (1864–1932), German physician]

ejaculation n. the discharge of semen from the erect penis at the moment of sexual climax (orgasm) in the male. The constituents of semen are not released simultaneously, but in the following sequence: the secretion of *Cowper’s glands followed by that of the *prostate gland and the spermatozoa and finally the secretion of the *seminal vesicles. See also premature ejaculation.

ejection fraction (EF) the proportion or percentage of blood in the left *ventricle that is ejected with each heartbeat. It is commonly used to quantify left ventricular function, the normal value being 50% or greater.

Ekbom’s syndrome 1. see restless legs syndrome. 2. see delusional infestation. [K. A. Ekbom (1907–77), Swedish neurologist]

elastase n. an enzyme that breaks down various proteins including elastin, which has a role in the connective tissue matrix. Pancreatic elastase, secreted by the pancreas, is not degraded in the small or large intestine; therefore its concentration in the stools expresses the functioning of the pancreas, which is the basis for the faecal pancreatic elastase test. In patients who have suspected pancreatic insufficiency, faecal pancreatic elastase is suppressed or absent. Patients at risk include those with chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, or previous pancreatic surgery.

elastic cartilage a type of *cartilage in which elastic fibres are distributed in the matrix. It is yellowish in colour and is found in the external ear.

elastic tissue strong extensible flexible *connective tissue rich in yellow elastic fibres. These fibres are long, thin, and branching and are composed primarily of an albumin-like protein, elastin. Elastic tissue is found in the dermis of the skin, in arterial walls, and in the walls of the alveoli of the lungs.

elastin n. protein forming the major constituent of *elastic tissue fibres.

elastography n. an ultrasonic imaging technique that displays the elasticity of soft tissues, most commonly using *ultrasound although *magnetic resonance imaging can be used to gather similar information. It has been found useful in demonstrating abnormalities of muscle, liver, and breast tissue.

elastosis n. degeneration of the yellow fibres in connective tissues and skin (see elastic tissue).

elation n. a state of cheerful excitement and enthusiasm. Marked elation of mood is a characteristic of *mania or *hypomania.

elbow n. the hinge joint (see ginglymus) between the bones of the upper arm (humerus) and the forearm (radius and ulna). It is a common site of fractures and dislocation.

electrocardiogram (ECG) n. a tracing of the electrical activity of the heart recorded by *electrocardiography (see illustration). It aids in the diagnosis of heart disease, which may produce characteristic changes in the ECG. See QRS complex; Q–T interval; S–T segment.

A typical electrocardiogram.





electrocardiography n. a technique for recording the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes connected to the recording apparatus (electrocardiograph) are placed on the skin of the four limbs and chest wall; the record itself is called an *electrocardiogram (ECG). In conventional scalar electrocardiography 12 leads (see lead2) are recorded, but more may be employed in special circumstances. Intracardiac electrocardiography involves the passage of a recording catheter into the heart for accurate mapping and analysis of arrhythmias (see electrophysiological study).

electrocardiophonography n. a technique for recording heart sounds and murmurs simultaneously with the ECG, which is used as a reference tracing. The sound is picked up by a microphone placed over the heart. The tracing is a phonocardiogram. It provides a permanent record of heart sounds and murmurs and is useful in their analysis.

electrocautery n. the destruction of diseased or unwanted tissue by means of a needle or snare that is electrically heated. Warts, polyps, and other growths can be burned away by this method.

electrocoagulation n. the coagulation of body tissues by means of a high-frequency electric current concentrated at one point as it passes through them. Electrocoagulation, using a *diathermy knife, permits bloodless incisions to be made during operation.

electrocochleography (ECoG) n. a test to measure electrical activity produced within the *cochlea in response to a sound stimulus. It is used in the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease and other forms of sensorineural *deafness.

electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) a treatment for severe depression and occasionally for *puerperal psychosis, catatonia, and *mania. A convulsion is produced by passing an electric current through the brain; this is thought to induce stimulation, and is modified by giving a *muscle relaxant drug and an *anaesthetic, so that in fact only a few muscle twitches are produced. The procedure can temporarily cause confusion and headache, which almost always pass off within a few hours. Patients often complain of memory problems during treatment, which normally subside when the treatment has ended. These side-effects are reduced by unilateral treatment, in which the current is passed only through the non-dominant hemisphere of the brain. A course of ECT usually entails between 6 and 10 treatments; sometimes up to 16 treatments are given to achieve remission of depression. ECT is effective in about 50% of patients in whom no other antidepressant treatment was successful, and NICE guidelines suggest it should be used in such cases. However, the beneficial effect on mood does not always last. Occasionally maintenance ECT (usually involving one treatment every 2–4 weeks) is given to avoid relapse after a completed course of ECT. Under the Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended 2007), special legal provision applies to ECT.

electrodesiccation n. see fulguration.

electroencephalogram (EEG) n. see electroencephalography.

electroencephalography n. the technique for recording the electrical activity from different parts of the brain and converting it into a tracing called an electroencephalogram (EEG). The machine that records this activity is known as an encephalograph. The pattern of the EEG reflects the state of the patient’s brain and his level of consciousness in a characteristic manner. Electroencephalography is mostly used in the diagnosis and management of epilepsy and sleep disorders.

electroglottography n. a method of assessing laryngeal function using external recording electrodes.

electrolarynx n. a battery-powered electrical vibrator that helps people to speak after *laryngectomy.

electrolyte n. a solution that produces ions (an ion is an atom or group of atoms that conduct electricity); for example, sodium chloride solution consists of free sodium and free chloride ions. In medical usage electrolyte usually means the ion itself; thus the term serum electrolyte level means the concentration of separate ions (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, etc.) in the circulating blood. Concentrations of various electrolyte levels can be altered by many diseases, in which electrolytes are lost from the body (as in vomiting or diarrhoea) or are not excreted and accumulate (as in renal failure). When electrolyte concentrations are severely diminished they can be corrected by administering the appropriate substance by mouth or by intravenous drip. When excess of an electrolyte exists it may be removed by *dialysis or by special resins in the intestine, taken by mouth or by enema. See also anion.

electromyography n. continuous recording of the electrical activity of a muscle by means of electrodes inserted into the muscle fibres. The tracing is displayed on an oscilloscope. The technique is used for diagnosing various nerve and muscle disorders and assessing progress in recovery from some forms of paralysis.

electron microscope a microscope that uses a beam of electrons as a radiation source for viewing the specimen. The resolving power (ability to register fine detail) is a thousand times greater than that of an ordinary light microscope. The specimen must be examined in a vacuum, which necessitates special techniques for preparing it, and the electrons are usually focused onto a fluorescent screen (for direct viewing) or onto a photographic plate (for a photograph, or electron micrograph). A transmission electron microscope is used to examine thin sections at high magnification. A scanning electron microscope reveals the surfaces of objects at various magnifications; its great depth of focus is advantageous.

electron transport chain a series of enzymes and proteins in living cells through which electrons are transferred, via a series of oxidation-reduction reactions. This ultimately leads to the conversion of chemical energy into a readily usable and storable form. The most important electron transport chain is the respiratory chain, present in mitochondria and functioning in cellular respiration.

electronvolt n. a unit of energy (symbol: eV) equal to the increase in the energy of an electron when it passes through a rise in potential of one volt. In clinical imaging, the energy of gamma rays is usually expressed in kiloelectronvolts (symbol: kV; 1 kV = 1000 eV).

electrooculography n. a method of recording eye movements and to assess the resting potential of the retina. Tiny electrodes are attached to the skin at the inner and outer corners of the eye, and as the eye moves an alteration in the potential between these electrodes is recorded. The recording itself is called an electrooculogram (EOG).

electrophoresis n. the technique of separating electrically charged particles, particularly proteins, in a solution by passing an electric current through the solution. The rate of movement of the different components depends upon their charge, so that they gradually separate into bands. Electrophoresis is widely used in the investigation of body chemicals, such as the analysis of the different proteins in blood serum.

electrophysiological study (EPS) an assessment of the electrical system of the heart by means of thin preshaped wires passed into the heart via the femoral vein. An *electrocardiogram is recorded from various points within the heart, and the reaction of the heart to timed electrical stimuli is observed. The information obtained guides treatment of arrhythmia, particularly *radiofrequency ablation.

electroretinography n. a method of recording changes in the electrical potential of the retina when it is stimulated by light; the recording itself is called an electroretinogram (ERG). One electrode is placed on the eye in a contact lens and the other is usually attached to the back of the head. In retinal disease the pattern of electrical change is altered. The technique is useful in diagnosing retinal diseases when opacities, such as cataract, make it difficult to view the retina or when the disease produces little visible change in the retina.

electrosurgery n. the use of a high-frequency electric current from a fine wire electrode (a *diathermy knife) to cut tissue. The ground electrode is a large metal plate. When used correctly, little heat spreads to the surrounding tissues, in contrast to *electrocautery.

electrotherapy n. the passage of electric currents through the body’s tissues to stimulate the functioning of nerves and the muscles that they supply. The technique is used to treat the muscles of patients with various forms of paralysis due to nerve disease or muscle disorder. See also faradism; galvanism.

electuary n. a pharmaceutical preparation in which the drug is made up into a paste with syrup or honey.

elephantiasis n. gross enlargement of the skin and underlying connective tissues caused by obstruction of the lymph vessels, which prevents drainage of lymph from the surrounding tissues. Inflammation and thickening of the walls of the vessels and their eventual blocking is commonly caused by the parasitic filarial worms Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The parts most commonly affected are the legs but the scrotum, breasts, and vulva may also be involved. Elastic bandaging is applied to the affected parts and the limbs are elevated and rested. Larval forms in the blood are killed with diethylcarbamazine. See also filariasis.

elevator n. 1. an instrument that is used to raise a depressed broken bone, for example in the skull or cheek. A specialized periosteal elevator is used in orthopaedics to strip the fibrous tissue (periosteum) covering bone. 2. a lever-like instrument used to ease a tooth or root out of its socket during dental extraction.

elimination n. (in physiology) the entire process of excretion of metabolic waste products from the blood by the kidneys and urinary tract.

elimination diet a diet in which foods suspected of not being tolerated are removed for a period of time and then reintroduced sequentially to identify any that then precipitate symptoms (e.g. *FODMAPS). An exclusion diet is a variant of this, in which a single food is excluded and symptoms monitored for any improvements (e.g. a lactose-free diet).

ELISA see enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

ELISPOT enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, used in monitoring the immune response. It specifically enumerates *cytokine-producing cells. Each spot that develops in the assay represents a single reactive cell.

elixir n. a preparation containing alcohol (ethanol) or glycerine, which is used as the vehicle for bitter or nauseous drugs.

elliptocytosis n. the presence of significant numbers of abnormal elliptical red cells (elliptocytes) in the blood. Elliptocytosis may occur as a hereditary disorder or be a feature of certain blood diseases, such as *myelofibrosis or iron-deficiency *anaemia.

Elschnig pearls round or oval transparent cystic structures on the posterior capsule of the lens due to proliferation of lens epithelial cells following extracapsular *cataract extraction. They can grow to cover the central part of the capsule and cause reduction in vision. [A. Elschnig (1863–1939), German ophthalmologist]

eltrombopag n. a drug used in the treatment of chronic *idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; it works by stimulating and increasing the production of platelets.

elutriation n. the separation of a fine powder from a coarser powder by mixing them with water and decanting the upper layer while it still contains the finer particles. The heavier coarse particles sink to the bottom more rapidly.

em- prefix. see en-.

emaciation n. wasting of the body, caused by such conditions as malnutrition, tuberculosis, cancer, or parasitic worms.

emasculation n. strictly, surgical removal of the penis. The term is often used to mean loss of male physical and emotional characteristics, either as a result of removal of the testes (castration) or of emotional stress.

embalming n. the preservation of a dead body by the introduction of chemical compounds that delay putrefaction. Embalming is employed mainly so that a body can be transported long distances and funeral rites can be conducted without undue haste. In the USA it is a routine hygienic measure.

embedding n. (in microscopy) the fixing of a specimen within a mass of firm material in order to facilitate the cutting of thin sections for microscopical study. The embedding medium, e.g. paraffin wax for light microscopy or Araldite for electron microscopy, helps to keep the specimen intact.

embolectomy n. surgical removal of an *embolus in order to relieve arterial obstruction. The embolus may be removed by cutting directly into the affected artery (arteriotomy). In some instances it is removed by a balloon *catheter, which is manipulated beyond the embolus from a small arteriotomy in an accessible artery. The catheter is then withdrawn carrying the embolus with it. In some cases of pulmonary embolism, embolectomy may be life saving. It may also prevent gangrene in cases of a limb artery embolus.

embolism n. the condition in which an embolus becomes lodged in an artery and obstructs its blood flow. The most common form of embolism is *pulmonary embolism, in which a blood clot is carried in the circulation to lodge in the pulmonary artery. An embolus in any other artery constitutes a systemic embolism. In this case a common source of the embolus is a blood clot within the heart in mitral valve disease or following *myocardial infarction. The clinical features depend upon the site at which an embolus lodges (for example, a stroke may result from a cerebral embolism and gangrene caused by a limb embolism). Treatment is by *anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin. Major embolism is treated by *embolectomy or *thrombolysis to remove or dissolve the embolus. See also air embolism.

embolization (therapeutic embolization) n. the introduction of any material to reduce or completely obstruct blood flow. Conditions such as varicocele, fibroids, hepatoma, congenital arteriovenous malformations (see angioma), angiodysplasia, malignant tumours, or arterial rupture are commonly treated with embolization. Under X-ray screening control, a catheter is guided to the blood vessel (artery or vein) supplying the affected area and occluding material, such as microspheres, metallic coils, PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), or gel foam, is injected. The procedure may treat the underlying problem or simplify subsequent surgery. See also chemoembolization; coiling; uterine artery embolization.

embolus n. (pl. emboli) material, such as a blood clot, fat, air, amniotic fluid, or a foreign body, that is carried by the blood from one point in the circulation to lodge at another point (see embolism).

embrasure n. the space formed between adjacent teeth.

embrocation n. a lotion rubbed onto the body to treat sprains and strains.

embryo n. an animal at an early stage of development, before birth. In humans the term refers to the products of conception within the uterus up to the eighth week of development, during which time all the main organs are formed (see illustration). Compare fetus. —embryonic adj.

An embryo.





embryology n. the study of growth and development of the embryo and fetus from fertilization of the ovum until birth. —embryological adj.

embryonic disc the early embryo before the formation of *somites. It is a flat disc of tissue bounded dorsally by the amniotic cavity and ventrally by the yolk sac. The formation of the *primitive streak and *archenteron in the embryonic disc determines the orientation of the embryo, which then becomes progressively elongated.

embryo transfer the transfer of an embryo from an in vitro culture into the uterus. See also in vitro fertilization.

EMDR see eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy.

emergency contraception see postcoital contraception.

emesis n. see vomiting.

emetic n. an agent that causes vomiting. Substances such as common salt, which irritate the stomach nerves if taken in sufficient quantities, cause vomiting. Some emetics, e.g. *ipecacuanha, are used as *expectorants at low doses.

eminence n. a projection, often rounded, on an organ or tissue, particularly on a bone. An example is the iliopubic eminence on the hip bone.

emissary veins a group of veins within the skull that drain blood from the venous sinuses of the dura mater to veins outside the skull.

emission n. the flow of semen from the erect penis, usually occurring while the subject is asleep (nocturnal emission).

EMLA cream a cream containing a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (*lidocaine and *prilocaine; hence the name). Applied to the skin as a thick coating and left on for a maximum of 90 minutes, it gives a helpful degree of local anaesthesia, allowing blood samples to be taken and facilitating biopsy procedures in young children.

emmetropia n. the state of refraction of the normal eye, in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus on the retina with the accommodation relaxed. Distant objects are seen clearly without any effort to focus. Compare ametropia; hypermetropia; myopia.

emollient n. an agent that soothes and softens the skin. Emollients are fats and oils, such as lanolin and liquid paraffin; they are used alone as moisturizers to lessen the need for active drug therapy (such as corticosteroids for eczema) and in skin preparations as a base for a more active drug, such as an antibiotic.

emotion n. a state of arousal that can be experienced as pleasant or unpleasant. Emotions can have three components: subjective, physiological, and behavioural. For example, fear can involve an unpleasant subjective experience, an increase in physiological measures such as heart rate, sweating, etc., and a tendency to flee from the fear-provoking situation.

emotionally unstable personality disorder a *personality disorder characterized by a tendency to act impulsively without consideration of the consequences, unpredictable and capricious mood, a tendency towards outbursts of emotion, inability to control behavioural explosions, quarrelsome behaviour, and conflict with others. There is an impulsive type, with particular emphasis on impulsivity and quarrelsome behaviour, especially when criticized; and a borderline type, with an emphasis on disturbance and uncertainty about self-image (including sexual preference), liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, excessive efforts to avoid abandonment, recurrent threats or acts of self-harm, and chronic feelings of emptiness. Treatments include cognitive analytical therapy (see cognitive therapy), *antipsychotic medication, and occasionally *SSRIs and *lithium. In DSM-5 the disorder is called borderline personality disorder.

emotional touchpoints a technique for encouraging users to talk about their experience of health care in subjective terms, thereby enabling providers to reflect on their practice and improve care delivery. Users are asked to talk about certain key moments of contact with the service (e.g. arrival on the ward, waking after an operation) and to characterize their experience using a selection of emotional words. The goal is to help staff to understand how users felt at these moments and thereby to develop more compassionate, holistic, and insightful care.

empathy n. the ability to imagine and understand the thoughts, perspective, and emotions of another person. In counselling and psychotherapy empathy is often considered to be one of the necessary qualities enabling a successful therapeutic relationship.

emphysema n. air in the tissues. In pulmonary emphysema the air sacs (*alveoli) of the lungs are enlarged and damaged, which reduces the surface area for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Severe emphysema causes breathlessness, which is made worse by infections. There is no specific treatment, and the patient may become dependent on oxygen. The mechanism by which emphysema develops is not understood, although it is known to be particularly common in men in Britain and is associated with chronic bronchitis, smoking, and advancing age. See also chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In surgical emphysema air may escape into the tissues of the chest and neck from leaks in the lungs or oesophagus; occasionally air escapes into other tissues during surgery, and bacteria may form gas in soft tissues. The presence of gas or air gives the affected tissues a characteristic crackling feeling to the touch, and it may be visible on X-rays. When air moves to the mediastinum the condition is known as *pneumomediastinum. It is easily absorbed once the leak or production is stopped.

empirical adj. describing a system of treatment based on experience or observation, rather than of logic or reason.

employment and support allowance (in Britain) an allowance payable to people under state retirement age who are unable to work because of illness or disability. Entitlement depends on either an adequate record of National Insurance contributions or satisfying income-related criteria. An assessment-phase allowance is paid during the first 13 weeks of a claim, and eligible claimants are paid the main-phase rate following a work capability assessment. The part of this allowance based on income is currently being replaced by a component of *universal credit; the part based on National Insurance contributions will remain in place.

empowerment n. giving or returning power to someone. Being ill is usually experienced as losing the ability to act as one wishes, and full recovery may only be achieved when the individual feels able to make their own decisions. This may be a problem where professionals insist on deciding for patients with certain conditions (e.g. mental illness). Empowerment involves action to redress the lack or *loss, for instance by offering explanation in a language, style, and level that is appropriate. See also autonomy; feminist ethics; paternalism.

empty nose syndrome an *iatrogenic condition that can follow surgery to widen the internal nasal cavity, particularly *turbinectomy. It is characterized by a sensation of dryness, and although the nasal cavity has been enlarged there is often a paradoxical feeling of nasal obstruction.

empty sella syndrome a congenital malformation of the bony structure (the *sella turcica) that houses the pituitary gland such that the space is largely filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which squashes the usually spherical gland into a flattened shape against the floor of the sella. It is usually associated with enlargement of the sella, which can be seen on lateral X-ray. Only 10% of cases of this condition have defective pituitary function.

empyema (pyothorax) n. pus in the *pleural cavity, usually secondary to infection in the lung or in the space below the diaphragm. Empyema is a life-threatening condition, which can be relieved by aspiration or drainage of the pus or by decapsulation (see decortication).

emulsion n. a preparation in which fine droplets of one liquid (such as oil) are dispersed in another liquid (such as water). In pharmacy medicines are prepared in the form of emulsions to disguise the taste of an oil, which is dispersed in a flavoured liquid.

en- (em-) prefix denoting in; inside.

enable vb. to empower someone to undertake an action or to take responsibility for a situation. See empowerment.

enalapril n. a drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It inhibits the action of angiotensin (see ACE inhibitor), which results in decreased vasopressor (blood-vessel constricting) activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Side-effects can include a persistent dry cough, a drastic fall in blood pressure, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and diarrhoea.

enamel n. the hard outer covering of the crown of a *tooth. It is formed before tooth eruption by *ameloblasts. The hardest substance in the human body, it is 96% mineral (primarily crystal *hydroxyapatite).

enarthrosis n. a ball-and-socket joint: a type of *diarthrosis (freely movable joint), e.g. the shoulder joint and the hip joint. Such a joint always involves a long bone, which is thus allowed to move in all planes.

encapsulated adj. (of an organ, tumour, bacterium, etc.) enclosed in a *capsule.

encephal- (encephalo-) combining form denoting the brain.

encephalin (enkephalin) n. a peptide occurring naturally in the brain and having effects resembling those of morphine or other opiates. See also endorphin.

encephalitis n. inflammation of the brain. It may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection or it may be due to an abnormal autoimmune process, such as an allergic response to a systemic viral illness or vaccination (see encephalomyelitis), a remote response to malignancy (paraneoplastic encephalitis), or a primary antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder. Recently a number of antibody-mediated encephalitides have been described (voltage-gated potassium receptor and *NMDA-receptor antibody being the commonest) that have characteristic clinical features and are often responsive to immunosuppressive therapies. Viral encephalitis is endemic in some parts of the world; it may also occur epidemically or sporadically. One form – encephalitis lethargica – reached epidemic proportions shortly after World War I and was marked by headache and drowsiness, progressing to coma (hence its popular name – sleepy sickness). Encephalitis can cause postencephalitic *parkinsonism. Another type of encephalitis that occurs sporadically is due to the herpes simplex virus.

encephalocele n. see neural tube defects.

encephalography n. any of various techniques for recording the structure of the brain or the activity of the brain cells. Examples are *electroencephalography and *pneumoencephalography.

encephalomyelitis n. an acute inflammatory disease affecting the brain and spinal cord. It is sometimes part of an overwhelming virus infection but acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a form of delayed tissue hypersensitivity provoked by a mild infection or vaccination 7–10 days earlier. Survival through the acute phase of the illness is often followed by a remarkably complete recovery.

encephalomyelopathy n. any condition in which there is widespread disease of the brain and spinal cord. Necrotizing encephalomyelopathy of childhood is a progressive illness with extensive destruction of nerve cells throughout the central nervous system. It is thought to be caused by a disorder of metabolism.

encephalon n. see brain.

encephalopathy n. any of various diseases that affect the functioning of the brain. See hepatic encephalopathy; spongiform encephalopathy; Wernicke’s encephalopathy.

enchondroma n. (pl. enchondromata) a benign cartilaginous tumour (see chondroma) occurring within cortical bone, usually in the short tubular bones of the hands and feet. Such tumours are usually solitary and asymptomatic, but an enlarging lesion may fracture (the usual reason for presentation). When multiple tumours occur the condition is known as enchondromatosis. Compare ecchondroma.

encopresis n. incontinence of faeces. The term is used for faecal soiling in a child who has gained bowel control but passes formed stools in unacceptable places. The underlying problem is behavioural and treatment is difficult, often requiring the input of a child psychiatrist. Encopresis must be distinguished from chronic constipation with overflow.

encysted adj. enclosed in a cyst.

end- (endo-) combining form denoting within or inner. Example: endonasal (within the nose).

endarterectomy n. a surgical ‘re-bore’ of an artery that has become obstructed by *atheroma with or without a blood clot (thrombus); the former operation is known as thromboendarterectomy. The inner part of the wall is removed together with any clot that is present. This restores patency and arterial blood flow to the tissues beyond the obstruction. The technique is most often applied to obstruction of the carotid arteries (carotid endarterectomy) or of the arteries that supply the legs.

endarteritis n. chronic inflammation of the inner (intimal) portion of the wall of an artery, which most often results from late syphilis. Thickening of the wall produces progressive arterial obstruction and symptoms from inadequate blood supply to the affected part (*ischaemia). The arteries to the brain are often involved, giving rise to meningovascular syphilis. Endarteritis of the aorta may obstruct the mouths of the coronary arteries, supplying the heart. Endarteritis of the arteries to the wall of the aorta (the vasa vasorum) contributes to *aneurysm formation. The syphilitic infection may be eradicated with penicillin.

end artery the terminal branch of an artery, which does not communicate with other branches. The tissue it supplies is therefore probably completely dependent on it for its blood supply.

endemic adj. occurring frequently in a particular region or population: applied to diseases that are generally or constantly found among people in a particular area. Compare ecdemic; epidemic; pandemic.

endemic syphilis see bejel.

endocarditis n. inflammation of the lining of the heart cavity (endocardium) and valves. It is most often due to rheumatic fever or results from bacterial infection (bacterial endocarditis). Temporary or permanent damage to the heart valves may result. The main features are fever, changing heart murmurs, heart failure, and *embolism. Treatment consists of rest and antibiotics; surgery may be required to repair damaged heart valves.

endocardium n. a delicate membrane, formed of flat endothelial cells, that lines the heart and is continuous with the lining of arteries and veins. At the openings of the heart cavities it is folded back on itself to form the cusps of the valves. It presents a smooth slippery surface, which does not impede blood flow. —endocardial adj.

endocervicitis n. inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the cervix (neck) of the uterus, usually caused by infection. Surface cells (columnar epithelium) may die, resulting in a new growth of healthy epithelium over the affected area. The condition is accompanied by a thick mucoid discharge.

endocervix n. the mucous membrane lining the cervix (neck) of the uterus, which (like the *endometrium) is covered with stratified columnar *epithelium.

endochondral adj. within the material of a cartilage.

endocrine gland (ductless gland) a gland that manufactures one or more *hormones and secretes them directly into the bloodstream (and not through a duct to the exterior). Endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands, the ovary and testis, the placenta, and part of the pancreas.

endocrinology n. the study of the *endocrine glands and the substances they secrete (*hormones). —endocrinologist n.

endoderm n. the inner of the three *germ layers of the early embryo, which gives rise to the lining of most of the alimentary canal and its associated glands, the liver, gall bladder, and pancreas. It also forms the lining of the bronchi and alveoli of the lung and most of the urinary tract. —endodermal adj.

endodermal sinus tumour a rare tumour of fetal remnants of the ovaries or testes. In women it is an aggressive malignant ovarian tumour that develops in adolescence and may secrete alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotrophin, which can be used as *tumour markers. It is treated by oophorectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy.

endodontics n. the study, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the pulp of teeth and their sequelae. A major part of treatment is *root canal treatment.

end-of-life care medication and other treatment to make a dying patient comfortable. See hospice; palliative.

endogenous adj. 1. arising within or derived from the body. Compare exogenous. 2. formerly (until the 1980s), denoting a type of *depression (also known as melancholia) that was thought to arise totally biologically and therefore without any particular triggers. It stood in contrast to reactive depression, which was supposed to have been primarily triggered by stress or trauma. Today this differentiation is not usually made as the validity of separating these two types of depression could not be proven.

endolymph n. the fluid that fills the membranous *labyrinth of the ear.

endolymphatic duct a blind-ended duct that leads from the sacculus and joins a duct from the utriculus of the membranous *labyrinth of the ear.

endolymphatic sac a dilatation at the end of the *endolymphatic duct that removes waste products from the inner ear.

endometrial ablation the removal of the entire endometrium by means of an ablative technique under hysteroscopic control, usually performed as a day case or in a specialized out-patient clinic. It is an alternative to the more traditional hysterectomies that were undertaken for the relief of *menorrhagia. Methods for hysteroscopic endometrial ablation introduced in the 1980s included Nd: YAG (neodymium: yttrium–aluminium–garnet) laser ablation, *transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE), and rollerball *electrocoagulation (RBE). These first-generation procedures remain the gold standard for the hysteroscopic treatment of menorrhagia. Since the 1990s, the second generation of hysteroscopic ablation techniques have been developed. These include balloon thermal coagulation, in which a heated balloon is inserted into the uterus and destroys the endometrium; microwave endometrial ablation (MEA), which vaporizes the endometrial tissue; and Novasure, which destroys the endometrium by *radiofrequency ablation. About 75% of women obtain satisfactory improvement in their symptoms after these procedures.

endometrial cancer a malignant tumour of the lining (*endometrium) of the uterus. Risk factors are nulliparity (never having given birth), obesity, and tamoxifen use as chemotherapy for breast cancer. The presenting symptom is usually *postmenopausal bleeding, but this cancer may present with postmenopausal discharge or *pyometra. The tumour invades the *myometrium and spreads down to the cervix and through the Fallopian tubes to the ovaries and peritoneal cavity and through the lymphatics to pelvic and aortic nodes. Prognosis depends on tumour differentiation, depth of myometrial invasion, extent of tumour spread, and involvement of retroperitoneal nodes. Treatment is laparoscopic abdominal *hysterectomy and bilateral *salpingo-oophorectomy, with *lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy if indicated.

endometrial hyperplasia an increase in the thickness of the cells of the *endometrium, usually due to prolonged exposure to unopposed oestrogen, which can be endogenous, as in anovular menstrual cycles; or exogenous, deriving, for example, from *hormone replacement therapy or an oestrogen-secreting tumour. It is classified as simple, complex, or atypical. Endometrial hyperplasia most commonly presents with abnormal uterine bleeding and accounts for 15% cases of postmenopausal bleeding. It may also be asymptomatic, and in some cases regresses spontaneously without ever being detected. The presence of atypical cells may lead to *endometrial cancer. Treatment can include progestogen therapy or surgery (see endometrial ablation); hysterectomy is advised when atypical changes are present.

endometrioma n. a complex *ovarian cyst, usually with ‘chocolate’ material (altered blood) inside and associated with *endometriosis. A history of cyclical enlargement of the nodule and painful periods is highly suggestive. There is a characteristic ground-glass appearance on transvaginal ultrasound and these cysts may be associated with a raised *CA125 level. Endometriomas are not amenable to medical therapy and should be surgically excised.

endometriosis n. the presence of fragments of endometrial tissue at sites in the pelvis outside the uterus or, rarely, throughout the body (e.g. in the lung, rectum, or umbilicus). It is thought to be caused by retrograde *menstruation. When the tissue has infiltrated the wall of the uterus (myometrium) the condition is known as adenomyosis. Symptoms vary, but typically include pelvic pain, severe *dysmenorrhoea, *dyspareunia, infertility, and a pelvic mass (or any combination of these). Medical treatment is aimed at suppressing ovulation using *gonadorelin analogues, combined oral contraceptives, or the intrauterine system (see IUS). High-dose progestogens suppress *gonadotrophins (FSH and LH), shrink implanted endometrial tissue, and reduce retrograde menstruation. They have a similar efficacy to other medical treatments, are cheaper, and have fewer side-effects than gonadorelin analogues. Surgical treatment may also be necessary, usually by laser or ablative therapy via the laparoscope. More radical surgical treatment in the form of a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is sometimes required.

endometritis n. inflammation of the *endometrium due to acute or chronic infection. It may be caused by foreign bodies, bacteria, viruses, or parasites. In the acute phase it may occur in the period immediately after childbirth (puerperium) but the chronic phase may not be associated with pregnancy (as in tuberculous endometritis). Chronic endometritis in women with IUDs may be responsible for the contraceptive action.

endometrium n. the mucous membrane lining the uterus, which is covered with columnar *epithelium. It becomes progressively thicker and more glandular and has an increased blood supply in the latter part of the menstrual cycle. This prepares the endometrium for implantation of the embryo, but if this does not occur much of the endometrium breaks down and is lost in menstruation. If pregnancy is established the endometrium becomes the *decidua, which is shed after birth. —endometrial adj.

endomorphic adj. describing a *body type that is relatively fat, with highly developed viscera and weak muscular and skeletal development. —endomorph n. —endomorphy n.

endomorphin n. see endorphin.

endomyocarditis n. an acute or chronic inflammatory disorder of the muscle and lining membrane of the heart. When the membrane surrounding the heart (pericardium) is also involved the condition is termed pancarditis. The principal causes are rheumatic fever and virus infections. There is enlargement of the heart, murmurs, embolism, and frequently arrhythmias. The treatment is that of the cause and complications. See also endocarditis.

A chronic condition, endomyocardial fibrosis, is seen in Black Africans: the cause is unknown.

endomysium n. the fine connective tissue sheath that surrounds a single *muscle fibre.

endonasal adj. within or through the nose: describing minimally invasive techniques that allow access through the nose to correct problems. Such procedures are performed by an ENT or ophthalmic surgeon or a neurosurgeon.

endoneurium n. the layer of fibrous tissue that separates individual fibres within a *nerve.

endoparasite n. a parasite that lives inside its host, for example in the liver, lungs, gut, or other tissues of the body. Compare ectoparasite.

endopeptidase n. a digestive enzyme (e.g. *pepsin) that splits a whole protein into small peptide fractions by splitting the linkages between peptides in the interior of the molecule. Compare exopeptidase. See also peptidase.

endophthalmitis n. inflammation, usually due to infection, within the eye.

endophytic adj. describing growth inwards from an epithelial surface due to invasion of the surrounding tissues. Endophytic growth is characteristic of carcinomas. Compare exophytic.

endoplasm n. the inner cytoplasm of cells, which is less dense than the *ectoplasm and contains most of the cell’s structures. —endoplasmic adj.

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) a system of membranes present in the cytoplasm of cells. ER is described as rough when it has *ribosomes attached to its surface and smooth when ribosomes are absent. It is the site of manufacture of proteins and lipids and is concerned with the transport of these products within the cell (see also Golgi apparatus).

endopyelotomy n. a procedure for relieving obstruction of the junction between the kidney pelvis and ureter. An incision is made, via an endoscope, through the obstructed junction, using electrocautery, laser, or an endoscopic scalpel. Following this, *balloon dilation is usually performed and a *stent inserted.

end organ a specialized structure at the end of a peripheral nerve, acting as a receptor for a particular sensation. Taste buds, in the tongue, are end organs subserving the sense of taste.

endorphin (endomorphin) n. one of a group of chemical compounds, similar to the *encephalins, that occur naturally in the brain and have pain-relieving properties similar to those of the opiates. They are also responsible for sensations of pleasure. The endorphins are derived from a substance found in the pituitary gland known as beta-lipotrophin; they are thought to be concerned with controlling the activity of the endocrine glands.

Most endoscopes consist of a rigid or flexible tube, a light source, and an image-capturing system (either optical or digital) to deliver the images to the operator. See also video capsule endoscopy; fibrescope. —endoscopic adj. —endoscopy n.

endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography see ERCP.

endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) surgery of the *paranasal sinuses using endoscopes. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) clears inflamed tissue from routes of sinus drainage and aeration to allow the other sinuses to return to normal.

endoscopic ultrasound the fusion of endoscopy with ultrasonography. An ultrasound probe is incorporated into the endoscope in order to deliver highly detailed images from within the body. Endoscopic ultrasound is used predominantly by gastroenterologists, to assess internal structures or organs within the upper gastrointestinal tract, or by respiratory physicians in the assessment of bronchial disease. It may be used for diagnostic purposes, to accurately stage a confirmed diagnosis of cancer or to obtain tissue samples using fine-needle aspiration. Therapeutic indications include drainage of a pancreatic *pseudocyst, the common bile duct, or the pancreatic duct, and coeliac plexus neurolysis, a technique used to deliver pain relief in cases of intractable abdominal pain, usually resulting from chronic pancreatitis.

Endovascular procedures are usually performed by an interventional radiologist or a vascular surgeon.

endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) a recently developed technique that involves the insertion of a covered metal *stent into an *aneurysm. The stent lines the aneurysm and thereby excludes it from the circulation, preventing further expansion and rupture. The delivery system containing the stents is introduced through the common femoral artery. *Fluoroscopy provides real-time imaging to guide placement of the stents and ensure they are in the correct anatomical position.

endovenous laser treatment (EVLT) a minimally invasive procedure to treat *varicose veins. A laser fibre (usually an 810-nm *diode laser) contained within a sheath is fed into the vein by ultrasound guidance and slowly withdrawn as it is fired, thereby delivering laser energy that causes irreversible destruction and eventual ablation of the vein.

end-plate n. the area of muscle cell membrane immediately beneath the motor nerve ending at a *neuromuscular junction. Special receptors in this area trigger muscular contraction when the nerve ending releases its *neurotransmitter.

enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) an experimental treatment for patients with intractable angina. Specially designed inflatable trousers are inflated rhythmically in time with ventricular *diastole. Theoretically this imparts additional energy to the circulating blood volume when the heart is relaxed, and this may improve blood flow down severely narrowed coronary arteries. It is also claimed to have beneficial effects on blood flow to other organs. Despite promising clinical trials, this technique has not been widely adopted.

enkephalin n. see encephalin.

enophthalmos n. a condition in which the eye is abnormally sunken into the socket. It may follow fractures of the floor of the orbit that allow the eye to sink downwards and backwards.

Entamoeba n. a genus of widely distributed amoebae, of which some species are parasites of the digestive tract of humans. E. histolytica invades and destroys the tissues of the intestinal wall, causing amoebic *dysentery and ulceration of the gut wall (see also amoeboma); infection of the liver with this species (amoebic hepatitis) is common in tropical countries. E. coli is a harmless intestinal parasite; E. gingivalis, found within the spaces between the teeth, is associated with periodontal disease and gingivitis.

enter- (entero-) combining form denoting the intestine. Example: enterolith (calculus in).

enteral adj. of or relating to the intestinal tract.

enteral feeding the process by which nutrients are delivered to the gut through a feeding tube – a *nasogastric tube, nasojejunal tube, a PEG tube (see gastrostomy), or a *jejunostomy tube. Polymeric feeds contain whole fats, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Feeds that are easier to digest include peptide feeds (containing short protein chains instead of whole protein) and elemental feeds (containing amino acids rather than whole proteins). See artificial nutrition and hydration; nutrition.

enteralgia n. see colic.

enterectomy n. surgical removal of part of the small intestine.

enteritis n. inflammation of the small intestine, usually causing diarrhoea. Infective enteritis is caused by infectious pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria; radiation enteritis is a complication of radiation therapy for pelvic and abdominal malignancies. It can cause fistulae, stricture formation, and malabsorption. See also gastroenteritis.

enterobiasis (oxyuriasis) n. a disease, common in children throughout the world, caused by the parasitic nematode Enterobius vermicularis (see threadworm) in the large intestine. The worms do not cause any serious lesions of the gut wall although, rarely, they may provoke appendicitis. The emergence of the female from the anus at night irritates and inflames the surrounding skin, causing the patient to scratch and thereby contaminate fingers and nails with infective eggs. The eggs may reinfect the same child or be spread to other children. Worms may occasionally enter the vulva and cause a discharge from the vagina. Enterobiasis responds well to treatment with *mebendazole.

Enterobius (Oxyuris) n. see threadworm.

enterocele n. a hernia of the *pouch of Douglas (between the rectum and uterus) into the upper part of the posterior vaginal wall. It may contain loops of small bowel.

enteroclysis n. see small-bowel enema.

Enterococcus n. a genus of spherical Gram-positive bacteria formerly classified as species of *Streptococcus. They are normal inhabitants of the human and animal intestine but a few species, notably E. faecalis and E. faecium, can cause infections in humans. They are responsible for some hospital-acquired infections and have been found in teeth with persisting disease after root canal treatment. Enterococci have the ability to survive under adverse (starvation) conditions and are therefore difficult to eradicate; there is concern at the development of strains resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics, such as *vancomycin (glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, GRE).

enterocolitis n. inflammation of the colon and small intestine. See also colitis; enteritis; necrotizing enterocolitis.

enterogastrone n. a hormone from the small intestine (duodenum) that inhibits the secretion of gastric juice by the stomach. It is released when the stomach contents pass into the small intestine.

enteroscope n. an illuminated optical instrument (see endoscope) used to inspect the interior of the small intestine. The image is transmitted through digital video technology. The examination can be performed using the oral and/or anal approach. The double balloon (push and pull) type, about 280 cm long with a distal balloon combined with an *overtube with a proximal balloon, is introduced under direct vision. Double balloon inflation and deflation helps in progression of the endoscope through the small intestine and is the predominant type in current use. The sonde (or push) type, about 280 cm long, has a single inflatable balloon that helps pull the instrument through the length of the intestine using peristalsis. It is now rarely used in clinical practice. The enteroscope is useful in diagnosing the cause of obscure gastrointestinal haemorrhage of the small intestine or of *stricture(s). It may also be used to treat bleeding lesions, remove small intestinal polyps, and to obtain tissue samples in suspected cases of malabsorption, inflammation, or intestinal tumours. —enteroscopy n.

enterostomy n. an operation in which the small intestine is brought through the abdominal wall and opened (see duodenostomy; jejunostomy; ileostomy) or is joined to the stomach (gastroenterostomy) or to another loop of small intestine (enteroenterostomy).

enterotomy n. surgical incision into the intestine.

enterotoxin n. a poisonous substance that has a particularly marked effect upon the gastrointestinal tract, causing vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain.

enterovirus n. any virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, multiplies there, and then (generally) invades the central nervous system. Enteroviruses include *Coxsackie viruses and *polioviruses.

enterozoon n. any animal species inhabiting or infecting the gut of another. See also endoparasite.

enthesis n. (pl. entheses) 1. the site of insertion of tendons or ligaments into bones. 2. the insertion of synthetic inorganic material to replace lost tissue.

enthesopathy n. any rheumatic disease resulting in inflammation of *entheses. Ankylosing *spondylitis, *psoriatic arthritis, and *reactive arthritis are examples. In these conditions the Achilles tendon is commonly involved, with swelling at its insertion on the calcaneus. Calcification within the tendon insertion may be seen on X-ray in patients with longstanding enthesopathy.

Entonox see nitrous oxide.

entoptic phenomena visual sensations caused by changes within the eye itself, rather than by the normal light stimulation process. The commonest are tiny floating spots (floaters) that most people can see occasionally, especially when gazing at a brightly illuminated background (such as a blue sky).

entrapment neuropathy pain, muscle wasting, and paralysis resulting from pressure on a nerve in conditions in which it is subjected to compression by surrounding structures. See carpal tunnel syndrome.

entropion n. inturning of the eyelid towards the eyeball. The lashes may rub against the eye and cause irritation (see trichiasis). The commonest type is spastic entropion of the lower eyelid, due to spasm of the muscle that closes the eye (orbicularis oculi). Entropion may also be caused by scarring of the lining membrane (conjunctiva) of the lid.

enucleation n. the complete removal of an organ, tumour, or cyst leaving surrounding structures intact. In ophthalmology it is an operation in which the eyeball is removed but the other structures in the socket (e.g. eye muscles) are left in place. Commonly a plastic ball is buried in the socket to give a better cosmetic result when fitting an artificial eye.

enuresis n. the involuntary passing of urine. The most common form is bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) by children (the majority of children are dry during the day by the age of three years and at night by four). Nocturnal enuresis is occasionally caused by underlying disorders of the urinary tract, particularly infection, but in the majority of children the problem is behavioural; there is often a family history. The condition usually settles spontaneously as the child grows older, but it may persist into teenage – and rarely adult – life. It can be treated by behavioural techniques, such as the use of a nocturnal alarm (see bell and pad) or *reinforcement of periods of continence with a reward system, or by drug treatment. Enuresis that starts in adulthood is usually associated with a disorder of the bladder, a side-effect of medication, or a neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis. See also incontinence. —enuretic adj.

environment n. any or all aspects of the surroundings of an organism, both internal and external, which influence its growth, development, and behaviour.

Environmental Health Officer (EHO) a person, employed by a local authority, with special training in such aspects of environmental health as housing, pollution, and food safety (formerly known as a Public Health Inspector). EHOs work closely with other professionals within the local authority and with other agencies, including *Public Health England.

environmental hearing aid any of various devices for helping people with hearing difficulties. Environmental aids include *assistive listening devices and alerting devices, such as door bells with visible as well as audible alarms, infrared links to televisions, and vibrating alarm clocks.

enzyme n. a protein that, in small amounts, speeds up the rate of a biological reaction without itself being used up in the reaction (i.e. it acts as a catalyst). An enzyme acts by binding with the substance involved in the reaction (the substrate) and converting it into another substance (the product of the reaction). An enzyme is relatively specific in the type of reaction it catalyses; hence there are many different enzymes for the various biochemical reactions. Each enzyme requires certain conditions for optimum activity, particularly correct temperature and pH, the presence of *coenzymes, and the absence of specific inhibitors. Enzymes are unstable and are easily inactivated by heat or certain chemicals. They are produced within living cells and may act either within the cell (as in cellular respiration) or outside it (as in digestion). The names of enzymes usually end in ‘-ase’; enzymes are named according to the substrate upon which they act (as in lactase), or the type of reaction they catalyse (as in hydrolase).

Enzymes are essential for the normal functioning and development of the body. Failure in the production or activity of a single enzyme may result in metabolic disorders; such disorders are often inherited and some have serious effects. —enzymatic adj.

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) a sensitive technique for measuring the amount of a substance. An antibody that will bind to the substance is produced; the amount of an easily measured enzyme that then binds to the antibody complex enables accurate measurement.

EOG see electrooculography.

eosin n. a red acidic dye, produced by the reaction of bromine and fluorescein, used to stain biological specimens for microscopical examination. Eosin may be used in conjunction with a contrasting blue alkaline dye taken up by different parts of the same specimen.

eosinopenia n. a decrease in the number of eosinophils in the blood.

eosinophil n. a variety of white blood cell distinguished by a lobed nucleus and the presence in its cytoplasm of coarse granules that stain orange-red with *Romanowsky stains. Eosinophils are capable of ingesting foreign particles, is present in large numbers in lining or covering surfaces within the body, is involved in allergic responses, and may be involved in host defence against parasites. There are normally 40–400 × 106 eosinophils per litre of blood. See also polymorph.

eosinophilia n. an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophilia occurs in response to certain drugs and in a variety of diseases, including allergies, parasitic infestations, and certain forms of leukaemia.

epicritic adj. describing or relating to sensory nerve fibres responsible for the fine degrees of sensation, as of temperature and touch. Compare protopathic.

epidemic n. a sudden outbreak of infectious disease that spreads rapidly through the population, affecting a large proportion of people. The commonest epidemics today are of influenza. Compare endemic; pandemic. —epidemic adj.

epidemiology n. the study of the distribution of diseases and determinants of disease in populations. Originally restricted to the study of epidemic infectious diseases, such as smallpox and cholera, it now covers all forms of disease that relate to the environment and ways of life. It thus includes the study of the links between smoking and cancer, and diet and coronary disease, as well as *communicable diseases.

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) a protein on the surface of cells (see receptor) that binds with epidermal *growth factor and is therefore involved in cell division. EGFR is expressed at increased levels in numerous tumours, particularly of the head and neck, and in colorectal cancer, in which it can be a target for antibody therapy with *cetuximab. *Tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting specifically on the EGFR include gefitinib and erlotinib in lung and pancreatic cancer.

epidermis n. the outer layer of the *skin, which is divided into four layers (see illustration). The innermost Malpighian or germinative layer (stratum germinativum) consists of continuously dividing cells. The other three layers are continually renewed as cells from the germinative layer are gradually pushed outwards and become progressively impregnated with keratin (see keratinization). The outermost layer (stratum corneum) consists of dead cells whose cytoplasm has been entirely replaced by keratin. It is thickest on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. —epidermal adj.

A section of epidermis.





epidermoid adj. having the appearance of epidermis (the outer layer of the skin): used to describe certain tumours of tissues other than the skin.

epidermoid cyst see sebaceous cyst.

epidermolysis bullosa any one of a group of genetically determined disorders characterized by blistering of skin and mucous membranes that occurs secondarily to minor mechanical trauma. Many different types exist: milder cases are restricted to skin and mucosal fragility; other types may be complicated by the development of skin squamous cell carcinomas (dystrophic) or death in early childhood due to overwhelming sepsis or airway involvement.

They are concentrated and stored in the lower part of the epididymis until ejaculation. —epididymal adj.

epididymitis n. inflammation of the epididymis. The usual cause is infection spreading down the vas deferens from the bladder or urethra, resulting in pain, swelling, and redness of the affected half of the scrotum. The inflammation may spread to the testicle (epididymo-orchitis). Treatment is by administration of antibiotics and analgesics.

epididymovasostomy n. the operation of connecting the vas deferens to the epididymis to bypass obstruction of the latter in an attempt to cure *azoospermia caused by this blockage. It is also performed to reverse vasectomy as an alternative to *vasovasostomy.

epidural (extradural) adj. on or over the dura mater (the outermost of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). The epidural space is the space between the dura mater of the spinal cord and the vertebral canal. The spinal epidural space is used for anaesthetizing spinal nerve roots (see epidural anaesthesia).

epidural anaesthesia suppression of sensation in the lower part of the body by the injection of a local anaesthetic into the *epidural space. The injection site is often the sacral or lumbar regions of the vertebral column, and a special blunt needle with a side-hole is used to reduce the chance of penetrating the dura. A fine catheter is passed through the needle to enable repeated or continuous infusion of anaesthetic solution. Epidural anaesthesia is particularly useful for providing pain relief during childbirth, to reduce the need for deep general anaesthesia, and for postoperative analgesia.

epigastrium n. the upper central region of the *abdomen. —epigastric adj.

epigastrocele n. a *hernia through the upper central region of the abdominal wall.

Epiglottitis usually occurs in children between one and seven years old, who complain of drooling and breathing difficulties and are acutely unwell. The main bacterium that causes epiglottitis is Haemophilus influenzae, and the infection has become much less common since the *Hib vaccine was introduced. Treatment consists of antibiotics and, if necessary, intubation. Children should be nursed in intensive care until the infection is under control.

epikeratophakia n. eye surgery to correct errors of *refraction in which the curvature of the cornea is altered using donor corneal tissue, which has been frozen and shaped using a lathe to produce a tissue lens that is then sutured onto the cornea.

epilation n. the removal of a hair by its roots. This can be done mechanically (by plucking, waxing, or threading) or by use of topical creams, electrolysis, and lasers.

epilepsy n. a disorder of brain function characterized by recurrent seizures that have a sudden onset. The term idiopathic is used to describe epilepsy that is not associated with structural damage to the brain. Seizures may be generalized or partial. Generalized epilepsy may take the form of tonic-clonic or absence seizures. In tonic-clonic (or major) seizures (formerly called grand mal), the patient falls to the ground unconscious with the muscles in a state of spasm. The lack of any respiratory movement may result in a bluish discoloration of the skin and lips (cyanosis). This – the tonic phase – is replaced by convulsive movements (the clonic phase) when the tongue may be bitten and urinary incontinence may occur. Movements gradually cease and the patient may rouse in a state of confusion, complaining of headache, or may fall asleep. Absence seizures (formerly called petit mal in children) consist of brief spells of unconsciousness lasting for a few seconds, during which posture and balance are maintained. The eyes stare blankly and there may be fluttering movements of the lids and momentary twitching of the fingers and mouth. The electroencephalogram characteristically shows bisynchronous spike and wave discharges (3 per second) during the seizures and at other times. Attacks are sometimes provoked by overbreathing or intermittent photic stimulation. As the stream of thought is completely interrupted, children with frequent seizures may have learning difficulties. This form of epilepsy seldom appears before the age of three or after adolescence. It often subsides spontaneously in adult life, but it may be followed by the onset of major or partial epilepsy.

In partial (or focal) seizures, the nature of the seizure depends upon the location of the damage in the brain. For example, a simple partial motor seizure consists of convulsive movements that might spread from the thumb to the hand, arm, and face (this spread of symptoms is called the Jacksonian march); there is no loss of awareness. Complex partial seizures are commonly caused by damage to the cortex of the temporal lobe or the adjacent parietal lobe of the brain: this form of epilepsy is often called temporal lobe (or psychomotor) epilepsy. Symptoms may include *hallucinations of smell, taste, sight, and hearing, paroxysmal disorders of memory, and *automatism. Throughout an attack the patient is in a state of clouded awareness and afterwards may have no recollection of the event (see also déjà vu; jamais vu). A number of these symptoms are due to scarring and atrophy (mesial temporal sclerosis) affecting the temporal lobe.

The different forms of epilepsy can be controlled by the use of antiepileptic drugs (see anticonvulsant). Surgical resection of focal epileptogenic lesions in the brain is appropriate in a strictly limited number of cases. See also aura; postictal phase. —epileptic adj., n.

Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre a series of head and body movements used to move microscopic debris from the posterior *semicircular canal in the inner ear. It is used in the treatment of *benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

EPO see erythropoietin.

epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin) n. any of four forms of *erythropoietin produced by genetic engineering – epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin theta, or epoetin zeta – used for treating anaemia associated with chronic renal failure or induced by chemotherapy. Darbepoetin alfa and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta are derivatives of epoetin with similar uses but longer duration of action. Side-effects include diarrhoea, raised blood pressure, headache, and flulike symptoms.

eponychium n. see nail.

eponym n. a disease, structure, or species named after a particular person, usually the person who first discovered or described it. Eponyms are widespread in medicine, but they are being replaced as more descriptive terms become necessary. Thus the eponyms islets of Langerhans, aqueduct of Sylvius, and Hashimoto’s disease are more likely to be designated in text books as pancreatic islands, cerebral aqueduct, and autoimmune thyroiditis, respectively. —eponymous adj.

epoophoron n. see paroophoron.

epoprostenol n. a prostaglandin drug (see prostacyclin) used immediately before and during renal dialysis to prevent clotting of blood in the shunt and also to treat primary *pulmonary hypertension. Side-effects include flushing, headache, and hypotension.

EPS see electrophysiological study.

Epstein–Barr virus (EB virus, EBV, human herpesvirus 4, HHV-4) the virus, belonging to the *herpesvirus group, that is the causative agent of *glandular fever. It attacks B *lymphocytes. EB virus is also implicated in hepatitis and in certain cancers (e.g. *Burkitt’s lymphoma and *Hodgkin’s disease). [Sir M. A. Epstein (1921– ) and Y. M. Barr (1932– ), British pathologists]

epulis n. a swelling on the gum or alveolar mucosa. There are three types: fibromatous (originating from the fibrous tissues in the mouth), ossifying (originating from fibrous and bony tissues), and acanthomatous (emerging from the periodontal ligament). A parulis is an epulis at the opening of a *sinus tract.

Epworth Sleepiness Scale a questionnaire to assess the likelihood of falling asleep. It is used to investigate sleep disorders, including *obstructive sleep apnoea.

equality n. in medical ethics, the principle that cases with an equal moral status should be treated equally. This means, most obviously, that patients with the same clinical needs should not be treated differently on morally irrelevant grounds, such as race (see discrimination), and are afforded identical rights, respect, and value. However, there is much debate over what characteristics are morally important when medical resources need to be rationed; for example, whether a patient’s age or *quality of life is morally important. See justice.

Equality and Human Rights Commission a nondepartmental public body set up in 2007 to promote human rights and equality in regard to age, disability, gender, race, religion and belief, pregnancy and maternity, marriage and civil partnership, sexual orientation, and human rights. It replaced the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission, and the Equal Opportunities Commission.

equi- combining form denoting equality.

equinia n. see glanders.

equipoise n. a state of genuine and substantial uncertainty as to which of two or more courses of action will be best for a patient. Equipoise is an important ethical principle in research, specifically in the design of clinical trials. It is generally held that the random allocation of patients to one or other arm of a trial is ethically acceptable only where there is a genuine uncertainty (equipoise) as to which treatment will most benefit trial participants. Knowingly to assign an individual to inferior or ineffective treatment (such as a placebo) would offend against the principle that his or her *best interests are paramount. A distinction is sometimes made between clinical equipoise, which refers to uncertainty across the medical profession as a whole, and theoretical equipoise, which refers to the uncertainty of an individual doctor. In addition, patients may not share the state of equipoise; for example, if a patient has his or her own preferences and there are significant side-effects influencing the choice of treatment, it would be *paternalistic and counter to *beneficence not to respect that patient’s wishes.

equity n. the absence of disparities in those aspects of health that can be controlled and modified. Discussion of equity usually accepts that complete health *equality is impossible, as some factors (such as genetic differences) are not modifiable.

Erb’s palsy weakness or paralysis of the shoulder and arm usually caused by injury to the upper roots of the *brachial plexus during traumatic childbirth. This may happen if, during a difficult delivery, excess traction applied to the head damages the fifth and sixth cervical roots of the spinal cord. The muscles of the shoulder and the flexors of the elbow are paralysed and the arm hangs at the side internally rotated at the shoulder with the forearm pronated (waiter’s-tip deformity). Recovery may be spontaneous, but in some cases nerve grafts or muscle transfers are required. [W. H. Erb (1840–1921), German neurologist]

ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) the technique in which a catheter is passed through a *duodenoscope into the *ampulla of Vater of the common bile duct and injected with a radiopaque medium to outline the pancreatic duct and bile ducts radiologically. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP; see cholangiography) is often used to diagnose biliary and pancreatic disease followed by ERCP for diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention. ERCP facilitates the removal of gallstones from the common bile duct, biopsy of lesions, and insertion of biliary *stents. See also papillotomy.

erectile adj. capable of causing erection or becoming erect. The penis is composed largely of erectile tissue.

erectile dysfunction inability in a male to obtain and/or maintain a penile erection to enable vaginal penetration for sexual intercourse. There are many causes and contributing factors; often a combination of physical causes and psychological factors is responsible for the condition. The physical causes include peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, certain medications, hypogonadism or other endocrine disorders, and anatomical abnormalities of the penis. Treatments that work by increasing blood flow to the cavernous sinuses of the penis include oral *sildenafil and injectable *alprostadil. Penile *prostheses can be surgically inserted into the penis when other treatments have not been effective.

erection n. the sexually active state of the penis, which becomes enlarged and rigid (due to the erectile tissue being swollen with blood) and capable of penetrating the vagina. The term is also applied to the clitoris in a state of sexual arousal.

erepsin n. a mixture of protein-digesting enzymes (see peptidase) secreted by the intestinal glands. It is part of the *succus entericus.

erethism n. 1. a state of abnormal mental excitement or irritability. 2. rapid response to a stimulus.

ergonomics n. the study of humans in relation to their work and working surroundings. This broad science involves the application of psychological as well as physiological principles to the design of buildings, machinery, vehicles, packaging, implements, and anything else with which people come into contact.

ergosterol n. a plant sterol that, when irradiated with ultraviolet light, is converted to ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). See vitamin D.

ergot n. a fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that grows on rye. It produces several important alkaloids, chemically related to LSD, including *ergotamine and *ergometrine, which are used in medicine in the treatment of migraine and in childbirth. Eating bread made with rye infected with the fungus has led to sporadic outbreaks of *ergotism over the centuries.

ergotamine n. a drug that causes constriction of blood vessels and is used to relieve migraine. It is administered in combination with cyclizine and caffeine. Common side-effects are nausea and vomiting, and ergotism may develop as a result of high doses; because of this it has largely been superseded by *5HT1 agonists.

ergotism n. poisoning caused by eating rye infected with the fungus *ergot. The chief symptom is gangrene of the fingers and toes, with diarrhoea and vomiting, nausea, and headache. In the Middle Ages the disease was known as St Anthony’s fire, because of the inflamed appearance of the tissues afflicted with gangrene and the belief that a pilgrimage to St Anthony’s tomb would result in cure.

erlotinib n. see epidermal growth factor receptor; tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

erogenous adj. describing certain parts of the body, the physical stimulation of which leads to sexual arousal.

erosion n. 1. an eating away of surface tissue by physical or chemical processes, including those associated with inflammation. In the skin, an erosion represents a superficial type of ulceration and therefore heals quite readily. 2. (in dentistry) loss of non-carious tooth surface, usually caused by repeated application of acid, which softens the enamel. It may result from excessive intake of fruit juice, carbonated drinks, or acidic fruits or by regurgitation of acid from the stomach, as in bulimia nervosa, hiatus hernia, alcoholism, or stress (see gastro-oesophageal reflux disease). The teeth become very sensitive. The aetiology should be identified and corrected; severe cases may require extensive dental restorations.

erot- (eroto-) combining form denoting sexual desire or love. Example: erotophobia (morbid dread of).

erotomania (de Clérambault syndrome) n. a delusion that the individual is loved by some person, often a person of importance. It can be a symptom of a *monodelusional disorder or part of a mental illness, such as dementia or schizophrenia.

error n. (in research) incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true (type I error) or failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is false (type II error). See significance.

eructation n. belching: the sudden raising of gas from the stomach.

eruption n. 1. the outbreak of a rash. A bullous eruption is an outbreak of blisters. 2. (in dentistry) the emergence of a growing tooth from the gum into the mouth.

erysipelas n. a streptococcal infection of the skin, especially the face, characterized by redness and swelling; it usually has a sharply defined margin, which may differentiate erysipelas from the otherwise similar *cellulitis. The patient is ill, with a high temperature. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (*penicillin V) is the treatment of choice.

erysipeloid n. an infection of the skin and underlying tissues with *Erysipelothrix insidiosa, developing usually in people handling fish, poultry, or meat. Infection enters through scratches or cuts on the hands, and is normally confined to a finger or hand, which becomes reddened; sometimes systemic illness develops. Treatment is with penicillin.

Erysipelothrix n. a genus of Gram-positive nonmotile rod-shaped bacteria with a tendency to form filaments. They are parasites of mammals, birds, and fish. E. insidiosa (formerly E. rhusiopathiae) is a widely distributed species causing the disease *erysipeloid.

erythema n. flushing of the skin due to dilatation of the blood capillaries in the dermis. It may be physiological or a sign of inflammation or infection. Erythema nodosum is characterized by tender bruiselike swellings on the shins and is often associated with streptococcal infection. In erythema multiforme the eruption, which can take various forms, is characterized by so-called ‘target lesions’ that may be recurrent and follow herpes simplex infection (especially in children) or medications (especially in adults). Erythema ab igne is a reticular pigmented rash on the lower legs or elsewhere caused by persistent exposure to radiant heat. Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease, slapped cheek syndrome) is a common benign infectious disease of children caused by erythrovirus (human *parvovirus B19). It is characterized by fever and a rash, first on the cheeks and later on the trunk and extremities, that disappears after several days. Erythema toxicum neonatorum (neonatal urticaria) is a common self-limiting asymptomatic rash appearing in up to half of newborns, usually 2–5 days after birth. It is characterized by small erythematous papules and pustules surrounded by a diffuse blotchy erythematous halo. The eruption typically resolves within the first two weeks of life. See also palmar erythema. —erythematous adj.

erythr- (erythro-) combining form denoting 1. redness. Example: erythuria (excretion of red urine). 2. erythrocytes.

erythrasma n. a chronic skin infection due to the bacterium Corynebacterium minutissimum, occurring in such areas as the armpits, groin, and toes, where skin surfaces are in contact. It fluoresces coral-pink under *Wood’s light and can be treated with topical or systemic antibiotics.

erythroblast n. any of a series of nucleated cells (see normoblast; proerythroblast) that pass through a succession of stages of maturation to form red blood cells (*erythrocytes). Erythroblasts are normally present in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, but they may appear in the circulation in a variety of diseases (see erythroblastosis). See also erythropoiesis.

erythroblastosis n. the presence in the blood of the nucleated precursors of the red blood cells (*erythroblasts). This may occur when there is an increase in the rate of red cell production, as in haemorrhagic or haemolytic *anaemia, or in infiltrations of the bone marrow by tumours, etc.

erythroblastosis foetalis a severe but rare haemolytic *anaemia affecting newborn infants due to destruction of the infant’s red blood cells by factors present in the mother’s serum. It is usually caused by incompatibility of the rhesus blood groups between mother and infant (see rhesus factor).

erythrocyanosis n. mottled purplish discoloration on the legs and thighs, usually of adolescent girls or obese boys before puberty. The disorder sometimes occurs in older women and is worse in cold weather. Weight loss is the best treatment because it reduces the insulating effect of a thick layer of fat.

erythrocyte (red blood cell) n. a *blood cell containing the red pigment *haemoglobin, the principal function of which is the transport of oxygen. A mature erythrocyte has no nucleus and its shape is that of a biconcave disc, approximately 7 μm in diameter. There are normally about 5 ×1012 erythrocytes per litre of blood. See also erythropoiesis.

erythrocyte sedimentation rate see ESR.

erythrocytic adj. describing those stages in the life cycle of the malarial parasite (see Plasmodium) that develop inside the red blood cells (see trophozoite). Compare exoerythrocytic.

erythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis) n. abnormal reddening, flaking, and thickening of the skin affecting a wide area of the body. Commoner after the age of 50, erythroderma affects men three times as often as women; it may result from pre-existing skin disease, such as eczema or psoriasis, or be caused by drugs or lymphoma. This clinical picture is a form of acute skin failure.

erythroedema n. see pink disease.

erythrogenesis n. a former name for *erythropoiesis.

erythromelalgia n. painful paroxysmal dilation of the blood vessels of the skin, usually affecting the extremities; the skin feels hot. Some patients may respond to aspirin.

erythromycin n. an antibiotic used to treat respiratory and other infections caused by a wide range of bacteria. Side-effects are rare and mild, though nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea occur occasionally.

erythron n. circulating mature red blood cells and that part of the blood-forming system of the body that is directed towards the production of red blood cells. The erythron is not a single organ but is dispersed throughout the blood-forming tissue of the *bone marrow. See also erythropoiesis.

erythropenia n. a reduction in the number of red blood cells (*erythrocytes) in the blood. This usually, but not invariably, occurs in *anaemia.

erythroplasia n. an abnormal red patch of skin that occurs particularly in the mouth or on the genitalia and is precancerous. Erythroplasia of Queyrat is a nonkeratinizing *carcinoma in situ affecting the glans of the penis or the inner surface of the prepuce. It is ten times more likely to progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma than is *Bowen’s disease of the penis. Compare leukoplakia.

erythropoiesis n. the process of red blood cell (*erythrocyte) production, which normally occurs in the blood-forming tissue of the *bone marrow. The ultimate precursor of the red cell is the *haemopoietic stem cell, but the earliest precursor that can be identified microscopically is the *proerythroblast. This divides and passes through a series of stages of maturation termed respectively early, intermediate, and late *normoblasts, the latter finally losing its nucleus to become a mature red cell. See also haemopoiesis.

erythropoietin (EPO) n. a hormone secreted by certain cells in the kidney in response to a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. Erythropoietin increases the rate of red cell production (*erythropoiesis) and is the mechanism by which the rate of erythropoiesis is controlled. Genetically engineered forms of the hormone are used for treating certain anaemias (see epoetin; ESA).

erythropsia n. red vision: a symptom sometimes experienced after removal of a cataract and also in snow blindness.

erythrovirus n. see parvovirus.

ESA erythropoiesis-stimulating agent: a substance similar to the hormone *erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production (erythropoiesis). Examples include the commercial *epoetin products.

eschar n. a scab or slough, as produced by the action of heat or a corrosive substance on living tissue.

Escherichia n. a genus of Gram-negative, generally motile, rodlike bacteria that have the ability to ferment carbohydrates, usually with production of gas, and are found in the intestines of humans and many animals. E. coli – a lactose-fermenting species – is usually not harmful but some strains cause gastrointestinal infections. Ingestion of the pathogenic serotype E. coli O157, derived from infected meat, causes colitis with bloody diarrhoea, which may give rise to the complications of *haemolytic uraemic syndrome or thrombocytopenic *purpura (see also food poisoning). E. coli is widely used in laboratory experiments for bacteriological and genetic studies.

escitalopram n. see SSRI.

esophoria n. a tendency to squint in which the eye, when covered, tends to turn inwards towards the nose. The eye always straightens on removal of the cover. See also heterophoria.

esotropia n. convergent squint (see strabismus).

espundia (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) n. a disease of the skin and mucous membranes caused by the parasitic protozoan Leishmania braziliensis (see leishmaniasis). Occurring in South and Central America, espundia takes the form of ulcerating lesions on the arms and legs; the infection may also spread to the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, causing serious destruction of the tissues.

ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) the rate at which red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle out of suspension in blood plasma, measured under standardized conditions. The ESR increases if the level of certain proteins in the plasma rises, as in rheumatic diseases, chronic infections, and malignant disease, and thus provides a simple but valuable screening test for these conditions.

essence n. a solution consisting of an essential oil dissolved in alcohol.

essential adj. describing a disorder that is not apparently attributable to an outside cause; for example, essential *hypertension.

essential amino acid an *amino acid that is essential for normal growth and development but cannot be synthesized by the body. Essential amino acids are obtained from protein-rich foods in the diet, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Adults require eight essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, threonine, methionine, tryptophan, and lysine. Children require an additional nine, as their body’s requirement is greater than can be synthesised by it: tyrosine, glycine, cysteine, arginine, proline, histidine, glutamine, serine, and asparagine.

essential fatty acids two groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids (see unsaturated fatty acid) that are essential for health but cannot be synthesized by the body. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the precursor for the *omega-3 fatty acids. Good sources include walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, rapeseed, soya, and corn oil. ALA can be converted (although not very efficiently) into DHA and EPA (the omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish). Arachidonic acid is not considered an essential fatty acid as it can normally be synthesized from ALA. Linoleic acid is the precursor for the n-6 (or omega-6) fatty acids. Good sources include vegetable oils, such as corn, safflower, soybean, sesame, sunflower, and walnuts. Both omega-3 and omega-6 acids should be consumed in the diet.

essential oil a volatile oil derived from an aromatic plant. Essential oils are used in various pharmaceutical preparations.

esterase n. an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of esters into their constituent acids and alcohols. For example, fatty-acid esters are broken down to form fatty acids plus alcohol.

ESWL extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. See lithotripsy.

etanercept n. a *cytokine inhibitor that is used in the treatment of severe rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, and severe psoriasis that have not responded to other treatments. Side-effects include nausea and vomiting, headache, and fever.

ethambutol n. a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, in conjunction with other drugs. It occasionally causes visual disturbances, which cease when the drug is withdrawn. Allergic rashes and digestive upsets may also occur.

ethanol (ethyl alcohol) n. see alcohol.

ether n. a volatile liquid formerly used as an anaesthetic administered by inhalation, but now replaced by safer and more efficient drugs. Ether irritates the respiratory tract and affects the circulation.

ethical erosion an empirically observed phenomenon whereby medical students and doctors become less morally sensitive and ethically aware due to increasing cynicism, the negative effects of health-care training and practice, and the desire to ‘fit in’ with others in the profession.

ethics n. 1. the branch of philosophy concerned with the content of moral judgments (normative ethics) and their nature and meaning (metaethics). See also consequentialism; Kantian ethics; narrative ethics. 2. the principles, values, virtues, or rules of conduct accepted within a particular profession or field of activity. See bioethics; medical ethics.

ethics committee a group usually including lay people, medical and health-care professionals, and other experts set up to review health-care practice. There are two types of ethics committee. A research ethics committee reviews research that involves the use of human subjects. It is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of patients by ensuring that they are adequately informed of the procedures involved in a research project (including the use of dummy or placebo treatments as controls), that the tests and/or therapies are relatively safe, and that no-one is pressurized into participating in research. There are legal as well as professional requirements to seek ethics committee approval, e.g. when carrying out clinical trials of drugs. The National Research Ethics Service (see Health Research Authority) coordinates the ethical review and governance of research referring submissions to research ethics committees (RECs) throughout the UK. The second type of ethics committee is a clinical ethics committee, which provides a resource to health-care professionals about ethical issues in clinical practice. There is neither an obligation for trusts to have a clinical ethics committee nor for clinicians to refer cases to such committees where they exist, although clinical ethics committees are an increasing presence in the NHS.

ethinylestradiol n. a synthetic female sex hormone (see oestrogen) used mainly, in combination with a progestogen, in *oral contraceptives. Alone, it is used for treating menopausal symptoms, hypogonadism, and menstrual disorders in women and advanced prostate cancer in men. See also cyproterone.

euchromatin n. chromosome material (see chromatin) that stains most deeply during mitosis and represents the major genes. Compare heterochromatin.

eugenics n. the alleged ‘science’ concerned with the improvement of the human race by means of the principles of genetics, strongly associated with ideas of selective breeding, discrimination, and immoral regimes, such as the Nazis in 20th-century Germany. Interventions used in reproductive medicine, such as *preimplantation genetic diagnosis, antenatal screening, diagnostic testing, and abortion, are regarded by some as potentially eugenic. —eugenic adj.

euglycaemia n. see normoglycaemia.

euphoria n. a state of optimism, cheerfulness, and wellbeing. A morbid degree of euphoria is characteristic of *mania and *hypomania. See also ecstasy; elation.

euthanasia n. literally ‘a good death’, normally understood as the act of deliberately taking life in order to relieve suffering. In voluntary euthanasia a person requests measures to be taken to end his or her life, usually by the direct administration of drugs (as opposed to being provided with drugs in *assisted suicide). Voluntary euthanasia is lawful in a number of European jurisdictions, e.g. the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Involuntary (or compulsory) euthanasia is where society or those acting on authority give instructions to end the lives of individuals, such as infants, who cannot express their wishes or have not given consent. See also artificial nutrition and hydration; assisted suicide; doctrine of double effect; extraordinary means.

euthymia n. a normal mood state, often referred to in *mental state examinations. The term also refers to a neutral mood state in a person with bipolar affective disorder. —euthymic adj.

euthyroid adj. having a thyroid gland that functions normally. Compare hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism. —euthyroidism n.

euthyroid sick syndrome (sick euthyroid syndrome) a syndrome characterized by alteration in the thyroid function tests in which the level of triiodothyronine is markedly reduced, thyroxine is slightly reduced, and thyroid-stimulating hormone is reduced or normal. This syndrome is commonly seen in nonthyroidal illness, due to altered metabolism and transport of the thyroid hormones, but can be mistaken for secondary *hypothyroidism.

evacuator n. a device for sucking fluid out of a cavity. In its simplest form it consists of a hollow rubber bulb that is attached, via a valve system, to a tube inserted into the cavity. Another valve leads to a discharge tube. Evacuators may be used to empty the bladder of unwanted material during such operations as the removal of a calculus or transurethral *prostatectomy.

evagination n. the protrusion of a part or organ from a sheathlike covering or by eversion of its inner surface.

EVAR see endovascular aneurysm repair.

evening primrose oil oil pressed from the seeds of the evening primrose plant (Oenothera biennis), which has been used medicinally for centuries. The oil is rich in the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid (see essential fatty acid) and also contains gamma-linolenic acid. The latter component is claimed by some to be the active ingredient of the oil but this is not proven. Symptom relief has been reported for rheumatoid arthritis, breast pain, premenstrual syndrome, eczema, diabetic neuropathy, cancer, hypercholesterolaemia, and heart disease, although study results have been negative or mixed.

eventration n. 1. protrusion of the intestines or omentum through the abdominal wall. 2. abnormal elevation of part of the diaphragm due to congenital weakness (but without true herniation).

EVLT see endovenous laser treatment.

Ewing’s sarcoma a malignant tumour of bone occurring in children and young adults. Distinguished from *osteosarcoma by J. Ewing in 1921, it commonly arises in the femur but is liable to spread to other bones and to the lung. It usually presents with pain, often associated with fever and *leucocytosis. The tumour is sensitive to radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with *cytotoxic drugs has greatly improved its prognosis. [J. Ewing (1866–1943), US pathologist]

EWS see early warning system.

ex- (exo-) prefix denoting outside or outer.

exanteride n. see GLP-1 receptor agonists.

excavator n. 1. a spoon-shaped surgical instrument that is used to scrape out diseased tissue, usually for laboratory examination. 2. a type of hand instrument with spoon ends used for removing decayed dentine from teeth. It may also be used as a *curette.

exchange transfusion a technique for treating *haemolytic disease in newborn infants. Using a syringe with a three-way tap, blood is withdrawn from the baby (via the umbilical vein), ejected, and replaced by an equal amount of donor blood compatible with the mother’s blood, without detaching the syringe. By many repetitions of this exchange, red blood cells liable to be destroyed and bilirubin released from those already destroyed are removed, while keeping the baby’s blood volume and number of red cells constant. Exchange transfusion can also be used in *sickle-cell disease, as a temporary treatment during a crisis, or in neonatal jaundice.

excimer laser a form of ultraviolet laser that can remove very thin sheets of tissue. This can be used to alter the curvature of the corneal surface, for example to treat long- or short-sightedness (see LASEK; LASIK), or to remove diseased (e.g. calcified) tissue from the corneal surface. See keratectomy.

excipient n. a substance that is combined with a drug in order to render it suitable for administration; for example in the form of pills. Excipients should have no pharmacological action themselves.

excise vb. to cut out tissue, an organ, or a tumour from the body. —excision n.

excrescence n. an abnormal outgrowth on the surface of the body, such as a wart.

excreta n. any waste material discharged from the body, especially faeces.

excretion n. the removal of the waste products of metabolism from the body, mainly through the action of the *kidneys. Excretion also includes the loss of water, salts, and some urea through the sweat glands and carbon dioxide and water vapour from the lungs, and the term is also used to include the egestion of faeces.

executive dysfunction disruption of the cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes, leading to deficiencies in planning, abstract thinking, flexibility, and behavioural control. It can occur following damage to the frontal lobes following stroke, traumatic brain injury, and dementia.

exemestane n. see aromatase inhibitor.

exenteration n. (in ophthalmology) an operation in which all the contents of the eye socket (orbit) are removed, leaving only the bony walls intact. The bone is covered by a skin graft. This operation is sometimes necessary when there is a malignant tumour in the orbit.

exercise n. any activity resulting in physical exertion that is intended to maintain physical fitness, to condition the body, or to correct a physical deformity. Exercises may be done actively by the person or passively by a therapist. Aerobic exercises are intended to increase oxygen consumption (as in running) and to benefit the lungs and cardiovascular system, in contrast to *isometric exercises. In isotonic exercises, the muscles contract and there is movement, but the force remains the same; this improves joint mobility and muscle strength.

exflagellation n. the formation and release of mature flagellated male sex cells (see microgamete) by the *microgametocytes of the malarial parasite (see Plasmodium). The process, which is completed in 10–15 minutes, occurs after the microgametocytes have been transferred from a human to the stomach of a mosquito.

exo- prefix. see ex-.

exocoelom n. see extraembryonic coelom.

exocrine gland a gland that discharges its secretion by means of a duct, which opens onto an epithelial surface. An exocrine gland may be simple, with a single unbranched duct, or compound, with branched ducts and multiple secretory sacs. The illustration shows some different types of these glands. Examples of exocrine glands are the sebaceous and sweat glands. See also secretion.

exotropia n. divergent squint (see strabismus).

expectorant n. a drug that enhances the expulsion of sputum from the air passages. *Mucolytic expectorants act by decreasing the viscosity of the bronchial secretions so that they are easier to cough up. Drugs such as *ipecacuanha and ammonium chloride are claimed to be stimulant expectorants in small quantities: they irritate the lining of the stomach, which is said to provide a stimulus for the reflex production of sputum by the glands in the bronchial mucous membrane. At higher doses they produce vomiting.

The resulting indent allows the retina to reattach. 3. vb. to transfer live tissue for culture outside the body. —explantation n.

exploding head syndrome (EHS, episodic cranial sensory shock) an auditory *hallucination, characterized by the perception of a sudden loud noise in the head or ears, that is experienced during a transition between sleep stages. The cause is not currently known.

exploitation n. taking unfair advantage of another’s misfortune, weakness, or *vulnerability. In medical ethics, the principle of *nonmaleficence means that doctors have an active duty to avoid any exploitation of their patients. This is usually held to require that professional boundaries are maintained and to prohibit personal or sexual relationships between professionals and their patients. Another example of potential exploitation is the practice of holding clinical trials and conducting research in developing countries when the treatments being tested are designed for sale and use in the West and will not be made available to those who acted as research participants or subjects.

exploration n. (in surgery) an investigative operation on a wound, tissue, or cavity. It may be undertaken to determine the cause of symptoms. —exploratory adj.

exposure n. (in behaviour therapy) a method of treating fears and phobias that involves confronting the individual with the situation he has been avoiding, so allowing the fears to wane by *habituation. It can be achieved gradually by *desensitization or *graded self-exposure or suddenly by *flooding.

expressed emotion a measure of the degree of warmth or hostility in a relationship between two people, assessed when one person is talking about the other. High levels of criticism and hostility from family members can worsen the prognosis of mentally ill patients, especially in *schizophrenia; increased expressed emotion may be addressed with specialized *family therapy.

expulsive haemorrhage sudden bleeding from the choroid, usually during a surgical procedure or trauma. This may force the ocular tissue out of the wound and is potentially one of the most devastating intraoperative complications of ocular surgery.

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) a technique that is accepted as a rescue treatment for otherwise fatal respiratory failure in newborn babies or infants due to prematurity or overwhelming septicaemia (e.g. meningitis). It involves modified prolonged *cardiopulmonary bypass to support gas exchange, which allows the lungs to rest and recover. ECMO is only available in selected high-technology centres.

extract n. a preparation containing the pharmacologically active principles of a drug, made by evaporating a solution of the drug in water, alcohol, or ether.

extraction n. 1. the surgical removal of a part of the body. Extraction of teeth is usually achieved by applying *elevators and extraction *forceps to the crown or root of the tooth to dislocate it from its socket. When this is not possible, for example because the tooth or root is deeply buried within the bone, extraction is performed surgically by removing bone and, where necessary, dividing the tooth. 2. the act of pulling out a baby from the body of its mother during childbirth.

extractor n. an instrument used to pull out a natural part of the body, to remove a foreign object, or to assist delivery of a baby (see ventouse).

extradural adj. see epidural.

extraembryonic coelom (exocoelom) the cavity, lined with mesoderm, that surrounds the embryo from the earliest stages of development. It communicates temporarily with the coelomic cavity within the embryo (peritoneal cavity). Late in pregnancy it becomes almost entirely obliterated by the growth of the *amnion, which fuses with the *chorion.

extraembryonic membranes the membranous structures that surround the embryo and contribute to the placenta and umbilical cord. They include the *amnion, *chorion, *allantois, and *yolk sac. In humans the allantois is always very small and by the end of pregnancy the amnion and chorion have fused into a single membrane and the yolk sac has disappeared.

extraordinary means life-prolonging treatments that are not regarded as beneficial (i.e. they do nothing to promote recovery or relieve suffering) and that may even be burdensome to the patient. It has been argued that there is no moral obligation to prolong life and/or to impose greater suffering by extraordinary means. ‘Extraordinary’ does not mean unusual: treatments that are considered routine may be classed as extraordinary when they are no longer clinically effective or are considered *futile. Another way to describe the appropriateness of such interventions is to talk of ‘proportionate’ and ‘disproportionate’ means. See artificial nutrition and hydration.

extrapleural adj. relating to the tissues of the chest wall outside the parietal *pleura.

extrapyramidal effects symptoms caused by a reduction of dopamine activity in the extrapyramidal system due to the adverse effects of *dopamine receptor antagonists, notably phenothiazine *antipsychotic drugs. These effects include *parkinsonism, *akathisia, and *dyskinesia.

Compare introversion. 2. a turning inside out of a hollow organ, such as the uterus (which sometimes occurs after childbirth).

extrovert n. see extroversion.

extrusion n. (in dentistry) 1. the forced eruption of a tooth either by means of an orthodontic appliance or surgically; for example, to realign a tooth that has failed to erupt or has been accidentally forced into the jaw. 2. the partial displacement of a tooth from its socket as a result of traumatic injury.

exudation n. the slow escape of liquid (called the exudate) that is rich in proteins and contains white cells through the walls of intact blood vessels, usually as a result of inflammation. Exudation is a normal part of the body’s defence mechanisms.

eye n. the organ of sight: a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light. The outer fibrous coat consists of the sclera and the transparent cornea; the middle vascular layer comprises the choroid, ciliary body, and iris; and the inner sensory layer is the retina (see illustration).

Extrinsic muscles of the left eye.





Light enters the eye through the cornea, which refracts the light through the aqueous humour onto the lens. By adjustment of the shape of the lens (see accommodation) light is focused through the vitreous humour onto the retina. In the retina light-sensitive cells (see cone; rod) send nerve impulses to the brain via the optic nerve. The arrangement of the two eyes at the front of the head provides *binocular vision. Each eye is contained in an *orbit, and movement of the eye within the orbit is controlled by extrinsic eye muscles (see illustration).

The eye (sagittal section).





eyeball n. the body of the *eye, which is roughly spherical, is bounded by the *sclera, and lies in the *orbit. It is closely associated with accessory structures – the eyelids, conjunctiva, and lacrimal (tear-producing) apparatus – and its movements are controlled by three pairs of extrinsic eye muscles (see illustration).

eyebrow n. the small fringe of hair on the bony ridge just above the eye. It helps to prevent moisture from running into the eye. Anatomical name: supercilium.

eyelash n. one of the long stiff hairs that form a row projecting outwards from the front edge of the upper and lower eyelids. The eyelashes help keep dust away from the eye. Anatomical name: cilium.

eyelid n. the protective covering of the eye. Each eye has two eyelids consisting of skin, muscle, connective tissue (tarsus), and sebaceous glands (meibomian or tarsal glands). Each eyelid is lined with membrane (*conjunctiva) and fringed with eyelashes. Stimulation of the pain receptors in the cornea causes the eyelids to close in a reflex action. Inflammation of a meibomian gland can result in a *chalazion. Anatomical names: blepharon, palpebra.

eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) a type of psychotherapy used for the treatment of significant anxiety or distress caused by traumatic events or in the context of *post-traumatic stress disorder. The aim is to separate the emotional from the actual memory of the event in order to reduce the anxiety related to the memory.

eyepiece n. the lens or system of lenses of an optical instrument, such as a microscope, that is nearest to the eye of the examiner. It usually produces a magnified image of the previous image formed by the instrument. Compare objective.

eyespot n. a small light-sensitive area of pigment found in some protozoans and other lower organisms.

eyestrain n. a sense of fatigue brought on by use of the eyes for prolonged close work or in persons who have an uncorrected error of *refraction or an imbalance of the muscles that move the eyes. Symptoms are usually aching or burning of the eyes, accompanied by headache and even general fatigue if the eyes are not rested. Medical name: asthenopia.

The typical facies seen in a patient with enlarged adenoids is a vacant look, with the mouth drooping open. A Hippocratic facies is the sallow face, sagging and with listless staring eyes, that indicates approaching death. 2. (in anatomy) a specified surface of a bone or other body part.

facilitation n. 1. (in neurology) the phenomenon that occurs when a neuron receives, through a number of different synapses, impulses that are not powerful enough individually to start an *action potential but whose combined activity brings about some *depolarization of the membrane. In this facilitated state any small additional depolarization will suffice to trigger off an impulse in the cell. 2. (in education and group therapy) the process of running, leading, or controlling a group discussion.

facio- combining form denoting the face. Examples: faciobrachial (relating to the face and arm); faciolingual (relating to the face and tongue); facioplegia (paralysis of).

It also causes mental retardation, poor growth, skeletal abnormalities, and kidneys of an unusual shape or in an unusual position. The condition is due to a defect in one of a group of genes known as Fanconi’s anaemia (FA) genes. Children are usually diagnosed between five and ten years of age. The only treatment available is *haemopoietic stem cell transplantation; without this, most affected individuals die by the age of 30 from bone marrow failure or leukaemia. [G.

Humans acquire the infection through eating wild watercress on which the larval stages of the parasite are present. The symptoms include fever, dyspepsia, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and coughing; the liver may also be extensively damaged (causing liver rot). Anthelmintics are used in the treatment of fascioliasis.

fasciolopsiasis n. a disease, common in the Far East, caused by the fluke *Fasciolopsis buski in the small intestine. At the site of attachment of the adult flukes in the intestine there may be inflammation with some ulceration and bleeding. Symptoms include diarrhoea, and in heavy infections the patient may experience loss of appetite, vomiting, and (later) swelling of the face, abdomen, and legs. Death may follow in cases of severe ill health and malnutrition. The flukes can be removed with an anthelmintic (such as praziquantel).

Fasciolopsis n. a genus of large parasitic flukes widely distributed throughout eastern Asia and especially common in China. The adults of F. buski, the giant intestinal fluke, live in the human small intestine. Humans become infected with the fluke on eating uncooked water chestnuts contaminated with fluke larvae and the resulting symptoms can be serious (see fasciolopsiasis).

fasciotomy n. a procedure used to relieve or prevent *compartment syndrome by incising the fascial compartment containing the muscle(s) involved and the overlying skin.

It also serves as an insulating material beneath the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue) and around certain organs (including the kidneys). Fat is one of the three main constituents of food (see also carbohydrate; protein); it is necessary in the diet to provide an adequate supply of *essential fatty acids and for the efficient absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine. Excessive deposition of fat in the body leads to *obesity. See also brown fat; lipid.

fatal familial insomnia an autosomal *dominant disorder due to a mutation in the gene for the *prion protein (PrP): it is an example of a *spongiform encephalopathy. Patients present with intractable progressive insomnia, disturbances of the autonomic nervous system, and eventually dementia.

fatigue n. 1. mental or physical tiredness, following prolonged or intense activity. Muscle fatigue may be due to the waste products of metabolism accumulating in the muscles faster than they can be removed by the venous blood. Incorrect or inadequate food intake or disease may predispose a person to fatigue. 2. the inability of an organism, an organ, or a tissue to give a normal response to a stimulus until a certain recovery period has elapsed.

The accumulation of fat in the liver and heart may seriously impair their functioning. The deposition of fat may be linked with incorrect diet, excessive alcohol consumption, or a shortage of oxygen in the tissues caused by poor circulation or a deficiency of haemoglobin.

fatty liver see nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

fauces n. the opening leading from the mouth into the pharynx. It is surrounded by the glossopalatine arch (which forms the anterior pillars of the fauces) and the pharyngopalatine arch (the posterior pillars).

favism n. an inherited defect in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causing the red blood cells to become sensitive to a chemical in fava beans (broad beans). Eating these beans results in destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis), which may lead to severe anaemia, requiring blood transfusion. Favism occurs most commonly in the Mediterranean and Middle East. See also glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

FCE see finished consultant episode.

FDA see Food and Drug Administration.

FDG see fluorodeoxyglucose.

fear n. an emotional state evoked by the threat of danger and usually characterized by unpleasant subjective experiences as well as physiological and behavioural changes. Fear is often distinguished from *anxiety in having a specific object. Associated physiological changes can include increases in heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, etc. Behavioural changes can include an avoidance of fear-producing objects or situations and may be extremely disabling. Specific disabling fears are known as *phobias. *Beta blockers relieve the physiological manifestations of fear and are useful in the treatment of short-term fears, such as the fear of hearing the results of an examination. *Behaviour therapy or *cognitive behavioural therapy are treatments for disabling and persistent fears.

febricula n. a fever of low intensity or short duration.

febrifuge n. a treatment or drug that reduces or prevents fever. See antipyretic.

febrile adj. relating to or affected with fever.

febrile convulsion (febrile seizure) an epileptic-type seizure associated with a fever. Such seizures affect up to 4% of children, usually aged between six months and six years, and generally last less than ten minutes. Seizures do not lead to mental retardation or cerebral palsy, although the risk of developing *epilepsy is around 2%, especially when other risk factors, such as family history, are present. Seizures may be recurrent, but the risk of this can be minimized by attempts to reduce the fever. The underlying infection is usually viral, but more serious conditions, such as meningitis, should be excluded.

febuxostat n. a drug used for the prevention of acute attacks of gout. It acts by inhibiting the enzyme zanthine oxidase, thereby reducing the level of uric acid in the blood and tissues. Side-effects include gout flares, nausea, diarrhoea, rash, and liver function abnormalities.

feedback n. (in physiology) the coupling of the output of a process to the input. Feedback mechanisms are important in regulating many physiological processes; for example, the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. In negative feedback, a rise in the output of a substance will inhibit a further increase in its production, either directly or indirectly (see negative feedback loop). In positive feedback, a rise in the output of a substance is associated with an increase in the output of another substance, either directly or indirectly.

Fehling’s test a test for detecting the presence of sugar in urine, which has now been replaced by better and easier methods. [H. von Fehling (1812–85), German chemist]

Felty’s syndrome a disorder characterized by enlargement of the spleen (*splenomegaly), rheumatoid arthritis, and a decrease in the number of neutrophils in the blood (see neutropenia). [A. R. Felty (1895–1964), US physician]

female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS) surgery to alter the size or shape of the *vulva and/or vagina when these are a cause of significant distress or sexual dysfunction. FGCS includes labioplasty (reduction or alteration of the labia), clitoral hood reduction (excision of excess skin in the fold surrounding the clitoris), and hymenoplasty (partial or complete reconstruction of the hymen).

female genital mutilation (female circumcision) removal of the clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora for cultural reasons. The extent of excision varies between countries and ethnic groups. The anatomically least damaging form is clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris); the next form entails excision of the prepuce, clitoris, and all or part of the labia minora. The most extensive form, infibulation, involves excision of clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora. The vulval lips are sutured together and a piece of wood or reed is inserted to preserve a small passage for urine and menstrual fluid. In the majority of women who are circumcised, *episiotomy, often extensive, is required to allow delivery of a child. FGM removes most of the possibility of sexual pleasure for a woman, is unethical, and in children is a form of *child abuse: it is prohibited under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003.

Femara n. see aromatase inhibitor.

feminist ethics an approach that is critical of the prevailing focus and methods of *medical ethics. In particular, it is argued that contemporary bioethics has replicated oppressive social structures, privilege, and power relationships at the expense of the marginalized. Moral problems are seen as determined from the social context in which they arise and narrative, care, and *empowerment are usually integral to feminist analyses of ethical dilemmas.

feminization n. the development of female secondary sexual characteristics (enlargement of the breasts, loss of facial hair, and fat beneath the skin) in the male, either as a result of an endocrine disorder or of hormone therapy.

femoral adj. of or relating to the thigh or to the femur.

femoral artery an artery arising from the external iliac artery at the inguinal ligament. It is situated superficially, running down the front medial aspect of the thigh. Two-thirds of the way down it passes into the back of the thigh, continuing downward behind the knee as the popliteal artery.

femoral epiphysis see femur.

femoral nerve the nerve that supplies the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh and receives sensation from the front and inner sides of the thigh. It arises from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves.

femoral triangle (Scarpa’s triangle) a triangular depression on the inner side of the thigh bounded by the sartorius and adductor longus muscles and the inguinal ligament. The pulse can be felt here as the femoral artery lies over the depression.

femtosecond laser a laser that emits optical pulses with a duration of femtoseconds (fs; 1 fs = 10−15 s), allowing micrometer-level accuracy and needle– or blade-free surgery. It has the potential to carry out lens extraction or cataract surgery through a pin-prick incision.

femur (thigh bone) n. a long bone between the hip and the knee (see illustration overleaf). The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the *hip bone. The greater and lesser trochanters are protuberances on which the gluteus and psoas major muscles, respectively, are inserted. The lateral and medial condyles articulate with the *tibia, and the trochlear groove accommodates the kneecap (patella).

The femur (front view).





The narrowed end of the femur (femoral neck), which carries the head, is the commonest site of fracture of the leg in elderly women. Partial dislocation of the femoral epiphysis, the growth area of the upper end of the bone, leads to deformity of the head of the femur and premature degeneration of the hip joint.

fenestra n. (in anatomy) an opening resembling a window. The fenestra ovalis (fenestra vestibuli) – the oval window – is the opening between the middle *ear and the vestibule of the inner ear. It is closed by a membrane to which the stapes is attached. The fenestra rotunda (fenestra cochleae) – the round window – is the opening between the scala tympani of the cochlea and the middle ear. Sound vibrations leave the cochlea through the fenestra rotunda which, like the fenestra ovalis, is closed by a membrane.

fenestration n. 1. (in dentistry) a ‘window’ of bone loss on the facial or lingual aspect of a tooth that places the exposed root surface directly in contact with the gum or the alveolar mucosa. 2. a surgical operation in which a new opening is formed in the bony *labyrinth of the inner ear as part of the treatment of deafness due to *otosclerosis. It is rarely performed today, having been superseded by *stapedectomy.

fenofibrate n. see fibrates.

fenoprofen n. an *analgesic drug that also reduces inflammation (see NSAID) and is used to treat arthritic conditions and pain. It may cause digestive upsets, drowsiness, dizziness, sweating, and headache.

fentanyl n. a potent opioid analgesic (see opiate) used for the relief of severe pain (for example in cancer patients already receiving other opioids) and for pain relief during surgery.

fermentation n. the biochemical process by which organic substances, particularly carbohydrate compounds, are decomposed by the action of enzymes to provide chemical energy. An example is alcoholic fermentation, in which enzymes in yeast decompose sugar to form ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.

ferning n. the appearance of a fernlike pattern in a dried specimen of cervical mucus, an indication of the presence of oestrogen, usually seen at the midpoint of the menstrual cycle. It can be helpful in the determination of ovulation. The same phenomenon occurs with premature rupture of the membranes (see fibronectin).

ferri- (ferro-) combining form denoting iron.

ferric sulphate an iron salt used in solution to stop bleeding, for example in pulpotomy of primary teeth.

ferritin n. an iron-protein complex that is one of the forms in which iron is stored in the tissues.

ferrous sulphate an *iron salt administered by mouth to treat or prevent iron-deficiency anaemia. There are few serious side-effects; stomach upsets and diarrhoea may be prevented by taking the drug with meals. Similar preparations used to treat anaemia include ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate.

ferrule n. (in dentistry) a continuous (360°) band used to encircle the remaining structure of a tooth before a crown is fitted. This helps to protect the tooth from fracture (the ferrule effect).

fertility rate the number of live births occurring in a year per 1000 women of child-bearing age (usually 15 to 44 years). A less reliable measure of fertility can be obtained from the live birth rate (the number of live births per 1000 of the population) or the natural increase (the excess of live births over deaths). More rarely quoted are the gross reproduction rate (the rate at which the child-bearing female population is reproducing itself) and the net reproduction rate, which takes into account female mortality before the age of reproduction.

fertilization n. the fusion of a spermatozoon and an ovum. Rapid changes in the membrane of the ovum prevent other spermatozoa from penetrating. Penetration stimulates the completion of meiosis and the formation of the second polar body. Once the male and female pronuclei have fused the zygote starts to divide by cleavage.

FESS functional *endoscopic sinus surgery.

festination n. short tottering steps that become more rapid, due to a loss of postural reflexes and stooped posture. Festination is found in patients with *parkinsonism.

fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD, fetal alcohol syndrome, FAS) a condition of newborn babies that results from the toxic effects on the fetus of maternal alcohol abuse. Babies have a low birth weight and growth is retarded. They have a small head (*microcephaly), low-set ears, eye, nose, lip, and nail abnormalities, and disturbances of behaviour and intellect. The greater the alcohol abuse, the more severe the fetal manifestations.

fetal blood sampling withdrawal of a sample of fetal blood, either from the umbilical vein during the antenatal period (see cordocentesis) or from a vein in the presenting part (usually the fetal scalp) during labour. The latter procedure is used to detect *hypoxia, by measuring the fetal pH and degree of *acidosis. The normal pH of fetal blood is 7.35 (range 7.45–7.25). The lower the pH, the more likely is the fetus to be suffering from hypoxia and acidosis, indicating an urgent need to deliver the baby.

fetal growth chart a graph, customized to a pregnant woman’s height, weight, and other factors, that plots *fundal height and estimated fetal weight on ultrasound against weeks of gestation. The graph, which shows centile lines (see centile chart), improves prediction of a baby who is *small for gestational age.

fetal growth restriction see intrauterine growth restriction.

fetal implant (fetal graft) the introduction of an ovum, fertilized in vitro and developed to the *blastocyst stage, into the uterus of a postmenopausal woman in order that she may become pregnant. Before this procedure, the woman’s uterus must be prepared, by hormone therapy, to receive and nurture the blastocyst. Hormone treatment is continued throughout the pregnancy.

fetal scalp electrode an electrical wire set into a sharp spiral metal tip and encased in a plastic sheath. It is attached to the fetal scalp for direct measurement of fetal heart rate by electrical activity.

fetal transplant a research method in which specific cells are taken from a normal fetus, with the informed consent of the mother following her request for termination of pregnancy, for transplantation into a person suffering from a specific disease. These fetal cells would take over the function of the specific diseased or damaged cells of the host. Examples are fetal brain cells transplanted into the affected part of the brain in a patient suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and fetal pancreatic cells transplanted into the pancreas of a juvenile diabetic. Other diseases are being investigated experimentally with a view to using fetal transplants. Such procedures involve major ethical considerations.

feticide n. the destruction of a fetus in the uterus by injection of potassium chloride into the fetal heart to stop any pulsation and other signs of life before induced abortion and following premedication to the mother. This is usually performed to achieve a late-stage termination of pregnancy (after 21 weeks), for example because of major abnormalities in the fetus.

fetishism n. sexual attraction to an inappropriate object (known as a fetish). This may be a part of the body (e.g. the foot or the hair), clothing (e.g. underwear or shoes), or other objects (e.g. leather handbags or rubber sheets). In all these cases the fetish has replaced the normal object of sexual love, in some cases to the point at which sexual relationships with another person are impossible or are possible only if the fetish is either present or fantasized. Treatment can involve *psychotherapy or behaviour therapy using *aversion therapy and masturbatory conditioning of desirable sexual behaviour.

feto- combining form denoting a fetus.

fetor (foetor) n. an unpleasant smell. Fetor oris is bad breath (*halitosis), which is most commonly caused by poor oral hygiene but can also occur in patients with acute appendicitis or uraemia. Fetor hepaticus is bad breath with a sweet faecal odour, occurring in patients with severe liver disease.

fetoscopy n. direct visualization of a fetus by passing a special fibreoptic endoscope (a fetoscope) through the abdomen of a pregnant woman into the amniotic cavity. Its original use as a technique for visualizing fetal malformations and sampling fetal blood for diagnosis of blood disorders has been abandoned with advances in high-resolution fetal imaging. It is now used to facilitate minimally invasive surgery on the fetus and placenta, either under local anaesthetic or by laparotomy on the mother; the fetoscope can be directed into place using *real-time imaging. Fetoscopic laser ablation of placental vessels is now commonly used in cases of twin-to-twin transfusion.

fetus (foetus) n. a mammalian *embryo during the later stages of development within the uterus. In human reproduction it refers to an unborn child from its eighth week of development. —fetal adj.

fetus papyraceous a twin fetus that has died in the uterus and become flattened and mummified.

Feulgen reaction a method of demonstrating the presence of DNA in cell nuclei. The tissue section under investigation is first hydrolysed with dilute hydrochloric acid and then treated with *Schiff’s reagent. A purple coloration develops in the presence of DNA. [R. Feulgen (1884–1955), German chemist]

FEV see forced expiratory volume.

fever (pyrexia) n. a rise in body temperature above the normal, i.e. above an oral temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) or a rectal temperature of 99°F (37.2°C). Fever is generally accompanied by shivering, headache, nausea, constipation, or diarrhoea. A rise in temperature above 105°F (40.5°C) may cause delirium and, in young children, *convulsions too. Fevers are usually caused by bacterial or viral infections and can accompany any infectious illness, from the common cold to *malaria. An intermittent fever is a periodic rise and fall in body temperature, often returning to normal during the day and reaching its peak at night, as in malaria. A remittent fever is one in which body temperature fluctuates but does not return to normal. See also relapsing fever.

FGF23 fibroblast growth factor 23: a hormone that is central to phosphate homeostasis. It is synthesized by osteoblasts and osteoclasts in response to high phosphate intake, hyperphosphataemia, or an increase in serum *calcitriol concentration. It inhibits phosphate reabsorption by the proximal tubule of the kidney and stimulates 24-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts calcitriol and its precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, into inactive metabolites. It may also have a negative effect on parathyroid hormone synthesis.

fibr- (fibro-) combining form denoting fibres or fibrous tissue.

fibrates pl. n. a class of drugs, chemically related to fibric acid, that are capable of reducing concentrations of triglycerides in the blood (see hypertriglyceridaemia); they may also reduce plasma *low-density lipoproteins and they tend to raise the levels of the beneficial *high-density lipoproteins. Fibrates are used for treating hyperlipidaemia; they include *bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and *gemfibrozil. Fibrates can have adverse effects on muscle (see myositis).

fibre n. 1. (in anatomy) a threadlike structure, such as a muscle cell, a nerve fibre, or a collagen fibre. 2. (in dietetics) see dietary fibre. —fibrous adj.

fibre optics the use of fibres for the transmission of light images. Synthetic fibres with special optical properties can be used in instruments to relay pictures of the inside of the body for direct observation or photography. see fibrescope. —fibreoptic adj.

fibrescope n. an *endoscope that uses *fibre optics for the transmission of images from the interior of the body. Fibrescopes have a great advantage over the older endoscopes as they are flexible and can be introduced into relatively inaccessible cavities of the body.

fibril n. a very small fibre or a constituent thread of a fibre (for example, a *myofibril of a muscle fibre). —fibrillar, fibrillary adj.

fibrillation n. chaotic electrical and mechanical activity of a heart chamber, which results in loss of synchronous contraction. The affected part of the heart then ceases to pump blood.

Fibrillation may affect the atria or ventricles independently. In atrial fibrillation (a common type of *arrhythmia), the chaotic electrical activity of the atria is conducted to the ventricles in a random manner resulting in a rapid and irregular pulse rate. The main causes are atherosclerosis, chronic rheumatic heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease. It may also complicate various other conditions, including chest infections and thyroid overactivity. The heart rate is controlled by the administration of *digoxin; in some cases the heart rhythm can be restored to normal by *cardioversion. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of blood-clot formation, which could cause a stroke.

When ventricular fibrillation occurs the ventricles stop beating (see cardiac arrest). It is most commonly the result of *myocardial infarction.

fibrin n. the final product of the process of *blood coagulation, produced by the action of the enzyme thrombin on a soluble precursor fibrinogen. The product thus formed (fibrin monomer) links up (polymerizes) with similar molecules to give a fibrous meshwork that forms the basis of a blood clot, which seals off the damaged blood vessel.

fibrinogen n. a substance (*coagulation factor), present in blood plasma, that is acted upon by the enzyme thrombin to produce the insoluble protein fibrin in the final stage of *blood coagulation. The normal level of fibrinogen in plasma is 2–4 g/1 (4–6 g/l during pregnancy).

fibrinogenopenia n. a former name for *hypofibrinogenaemia.

fibrinoid adj. resembling the protein fibrin.

fibrinolysin n. see plasmin.

fibrinolysis n. the process by which blood clots are removed from the circulation, involving digestion of the insoluble protein *fibrin by the enzyme *plasmin. The latter exists in the plasma as an inactive precursor (plasminogen), which is activated in parallel with the *blood coagulation process. Normally a balance is maintained between the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the body; an abnormal increase in fibrinolysis leads to excessive bleeding.

fibrinolytic adj. describing a group of drugs that are capable of breaking down the protein fibrin (see fibrinolysis), which is the main constituent of blood clots, and are therefore used to disperse blood clots (thrombi) that have formed within the circulation, most notably after myocardial infarction. They include *streptokinase, *urokinase, *alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. Possible side-effects include bleeding at needle puncture sites, headache, backache, blood spots in the skin, and allergic reactions.

fibroadenoma n. see adenoma.

fibroblast n. a widely distributed cell in *connective tissue that is responsible for the production of both the ground substance and of the precursors of collagen, elastic fibres, and reticular fibres.

fibrocartilage n. a tough kind of *cartilage in which there are dense bundles of fibres in the matrix. It is found in the intervertebral discs and pubic symphysis.

fibrocyst n. a benign tumour of fibrous connective tissue containing cystic spaces. —fibrocystic adj.

fibrocystic disease of the pancreas see cystic fibrosis.

fibrocyte n. an inactive cell present in fully differentiated *connective tissue. It is derived from a *fibroblast.

fibrodysplasia n. abnormal development affecting connective tissue.

fibroelastosis n. overgrowth or disturbed growth of the yellow (elastic) fibres in *connective tissue, especially endocardial fibroelastosis, overgrowth and thickening of the inner layer of the heart’s left ventricle.

fibroepithelial polyp a fibrous overgrowth covered by epithelium, often occurring inside the mouth in response to chronic irritation (usually following accidental biting). It is sometimes called a fibrous *epulis.

fibroid 1. n. (leiomyoma, uterine fibroid) a benign tumour of fibrous and muscular tissue, one or more of which may develop within or attached to the outside of the uterus (see illustration overleaf). Fibroids that are large or distort the uterine cavity often cause pain and excessive menstrual bleeding. There may be difficulties with fertility and childbirth. Fibroids are more common in women over 30 years of age and they shrink after the menopause unless the woman is taking HRT. Medical treatment of fibroids includes administration of *gonadorelin analogues or more recently *ulipristal. Small fibroids can be destroyed by diathermy using a hysteroscope. Larger ones may be coagulated by laparoscopic use of the Nd:YAG *laser (laparoscopic myolysis) or removed by *myomectomy or *uterine artery embolization. Otherwise hysterectomy may be necessary. If discomfort and other symptoms are absent, surgery is not required. 2. adj. resembling or containing fibres.

Types of fibroid.





fibroma n. (pl. fibromas or fibromata) a benign tumour of fibrous or connective tissue origin.

fibromyalgia n. a disorder characterized by pain in the fibrous tissue components of muscles without any inflammation (compare fibromyositis). Widespread aching and stiffness with specific tender points are accompanied by extreme fatigue and often associated with headache, numbness and tingling, and various other symptoms. Fibromyalgia is frequently triggered by anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, and straining or overuse of muscles; it appears to be closely related to *CFS/ME/PVF.

fibromyositis n. general inflammation of fibromuscular tissue.

fibronectin n. a large glycoprotein that acts as a host defence mechanism. In the plasma it induces phagocytosis and on the cell surface it induces protein linkage which is important in the formation of new epithelium in wound healing. It is also involved in platelet aggregation. It is concentrated in connective tissue and the endothelium of the capillaries and is a component of the extracellular matrix. In pregnancy, fetal fibronectin (fFN) is found in high concentrations in secretions from the cervix and vagina before fusion of the membranes occurs at around 21 weeks of gestation. Inflammation or trauma to the fetal–maternal surface after then causes secretion of fFN into the cervix and vagina. Vaginal swabs that detect fFN can be used to predict preterm birth between 22 and 34 weeks gestation.

fibroplasia n. the production of fibrous tissue, which is a part of the normal healing process. See also retinopathy.

fibrosarcoma n. a malignant tumour of connective tissue, derived from *fibroblasts. Fibrosarcomas may arise in soft tissue or bone; they can affect any organ but are most common in the limbs, particularly the leg. They occur in people of all ages and may be congenital. The cells of these tumours show varying degrees of differentiation; the less well differentiated tumours containing elements of histiocytes have been recently reclassified as malignant fibrous histiocytomas.

fibrosis n. thickening and scarring of connective tissue, most often a consequence of inflammation or injury. Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis is thickening and stiffening of the lining of the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, causing progressive breathlessness. See also cystic fibrosis; retroperitoneal fibrosis. —fibrotic adj.

fibrositis n. inflammation of fibrous connective tissue, especially an acute inflammation of back muscles and their sheaths, causing pain and stiffness. See also muscular rheumatism.

fibrous dysplasia a developmental abnormality in which changes occur in bony tissue. Trabecular bone is replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in aching and a tendency to pathological fracture. In monostotic fibrous dysplasia one bone is affected; polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involves many bones. There is a small risk (5–10%) of malignant transformation (*fibrosarcoma).

fibula n. the long thin outer bone of the lower leg. The head of the fibula articulates with the *tibia just below the knee; the lower end projects laterally as the lateral malleolus, which articulates with one side of the *talus. —fibular adj.

fiduciary relationship a relationship in which one person holds a position of trust with respect to the other and is expected to act solely in the *best interests of that person and to treat information shared as confidential. In medicine, the doctor–patient relationship is a fiduciary relationship.

field of vision see visual field.

fifth disease see erythema.

figlu test a test for folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. A dose of the amino acid histidine, which requires the presence of folate or vitamin B12 for its complete breakdown, is given by mouth. In the absence of these vitamins, formiminoglutamic acid (figlu) – an intermediate product in histidine metabolism – accumulates and can be detected in the urine.

FIGO staging a classification drawn up by the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics to define the extent of the spread of gynaecological cancers.

filaggrin n. a filament-associated protein vital for skin barrier function. Mutations in the filaggrin gene have been associated with atopic *eczema, other atopic disease, and *ichthyosis vulgaris.

filament n. a very fine threadlike structure, such as a chain of bacterial cells. —filamentous adj.

filaria n. (pl. filariae) any of the long threadlike nematode worms that, as adults, are parasites of human connective and lymphatic tissues capable of causing disease. They include the genera *Brugia, *Loa, *Onchocerca, and *Wuchereria. Filariae differ from the intestinal nematodes (see hookworm) in that they undergo part of their development in the body of a bloodsucking insect, e.g. a mosquito, on which they subsequently depend for their transmission to another human host. See also microfilaria. —filarial adj.

filariasis n. a disease, common in the tropics and subtropics, caused by the presence in the lymph vessels of the parasitic nematode worms Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi (see filaria). The worms, which are transmitted to humans by various mosquitoes (including Aëdes, Culex, Anopheles, and Mansonia), bring about inflammation and eventual blocking of lymph vessels, which causes the surrounding tissues to swell (see elephantiasis). The rupture of urinary lymphatics may lead to the presence of *chyle in the urine. Filariasis is treated with the drug *diethylcarbamazine.

file n. 1. an instrument used to remove a sharp edge of bone. 2. an instrument used in *endodontics to prepare the walls of a root canal for *root canal treatment. Files may be used by hand or in a *dental handpiece (rotary files); they are made from stainless steel or nickel-titanium alloy.

filiform adj. shaped like a thread; for example, the threadlike filiform papillae of the *tongue.

filling n. (in dentistry) the operation of inserting a specially prepared substance into a cavity drilled in a tooth to replace the tooth tissue that has been lost, often as a result of dental caries. The filling may be temporary or permanent, and various materials may be used (see amalgam; cement; composite resin; gold).

filum n. a threadlike structure. The filum terminale is the slender tapering terminal section of the spinal cord.

FIM see Functional Independence Measure.

fimbria n. (pl. fimbriae) a fringe or fringelike process, such as any of the finger-like projections that surround the opening of the ovarian end of the *Fallopian tube. —fimbrial adj.

fimbrial cyst a simple cyst of the *fimbria of the Fallopian tube.

finasteride n. a drug that causes shrinkage of the prostate gland. It is administered by mouth both to relieve the symptoms of urinary retention caused by an enlarged gland obstructing the outflow of urine from the bladder and to reduce the risk of urinary retention. An *anti-androgen, the drug acts by reducing androgenic stimulation of the prostate, inhibiting the enzyme 5α-reductase, responsible for converting testosterone to its more active metabolite, *dihydrotestosterone, within the gland. Side-effects include impotence and breast pain and enlargement. A low-dose formulation of finasteride is used to treat baldness in men.

fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA cytology) a technique in which a thin hollow needle is inserted into a mass to extract a tissue sample for microscopic examination. It is useful for detecting the presence of malignant cells, particularly in lumps of the breast and thyroid. See also aspiration cytology.

finger-flexion reflex see Hoffmann’s sign.

finger–nose test a test for *ataxia or cerebral lesions. Using the index finger, the patient alternately touches his or her nose and then the examiner’s finger, which is shifted to a new position for each of the patient’s movements. The test is positive if the patient misses a target or develops a tremor as the target is approached (intention tremor).

fingerprint n. the distinctive pattern of minute ridges in the outer horny layer of the skin. Every individual has a unique pattern of loops (70%), whorls (25%), or arches (5%) (see illustration). Fingerprint patterns can show the presence of inherited disorders. See also dermatoglyphics.

Fingerprint. Ridges on the hand, with details of the most common fingerprints.





finished consultant episode (FCE) the time a patient spends in the care of one consultant in one health-care provider. If a patient is transferred to a different hospital provider or a different consultant within the same hospital, a new FCE begins. In *hospital episode statistics an FCE is commonly referred to as simply an ‘episode’. A *spell may consist of several episodes. See also continuous patient pathway.

firedamp n. (in mining) an explosive mixture of gases, usually containing a high proportion of methane, occasionally encountered in pockets underground. It can be distinguished from *blackdamp (chokedamp), which does not ignite.

first aid procedures used in an emergency to help a wounded or ill patient before the arrival of a doctor or admission to hospital.

first do no harm see primum non nocere. See also nonmaleficence.

first intention see intention.

first-line treatment therapy that is the first choice for treating a particular condition; other (second-line) treatments are used only if first-line therapy has failed.

first-pass metabolism a process in which a drug administered by mouth is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and transported via the portal vein to the liver, where it is metabolized. As a result, in some cases only a small proportion of the active drug reaches the systemic circulation and its intended target tissue. First-pass metabolism can be bypassed by giving the drug via sublingual or buccal routes.

first-rank symptom see Schneiderian first- and second-rank symptoms.

FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) a technique that allows the nuclear DNA of *interphase cells or the DNA of *metaphase chromosomes, which are fixed to a glass microscope slide, to anneal with a fluorescent gene *probe. It is used for detecting and locating gene mutations and chromosome abnormalities.

fission n. a method of asexual reproduction in which the body of a protozoan or bacterium splits into two equal parts (binary fission), as in the *amoebae, or more than two equal parts (multiple fission), for example sporozoite formation in the malarial parasite (see Plasmodium). The resulting products of fission eventually grow into complete organisms.

fissure n. 1. (in anatomy) a groove or cleft; e.g. the fissure of Sylvius is the groove that separates the temporal lobe of the brain from the frontal and parietal lobes. 2. (in pathology) a cleft-like defect in the skin or mucous membranes. See anal fissure. 3. (in dentistry) a naturally occurring groove in the enamel on the surface of a tooth, especially a premolar or molar. It is a common site of dental caries.

fissure sealant (in dentistry) a plastic coating that is bonded to the enamel surface of premolar and molar teeth to seal the fissures, in order to prevent dental caries. Composite resins, unfilled resins, and glass ionomer cements have been used as fissure sealants.

fistula n. (pl. fistulae) 1. an abnormal communication between two hollow organs, connecting two mucosa-lined surfaces, or between a hollow organ and the exterior. Many fistulae are caused by infection or injury. For example, an anal fistula may develop after an abscess in the rectum has burst (see ischiorectal abscess), creating an opening between the anal canal and the surface of the skin. *Crohn’s disease has a particular tendency to cause fistulae to form between adjacent loops of bowel or from bowel to bladder, vagina, or skin. Some fistulae result from malignant growths or ulceration: a carcinoma of the colon may invade and ulcerate the adjacent wall of the stomach, causing a gastrocolic fistula. Other fistulae develop as complications of surgery: after gall-bladder surgery, for example, bile may continually escape to the surface through the wound producing a biliary fistula. Fistulae may also be a form of congenital abnormality; examples include a tracheo-oesophageal fistula (between the windpipe and gullet) and a rectovaginal fistula (between the rectum and vagina). 2. (arteriovenous fistula) a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, usually in a limb, to create arterial and venous access for *haemodialysis. It can be a direct *anastomosis between the artery and vein or a loop connecting the two, which may be autogenous or prosthetic.

fistulography n. imaging of a *fistula. X-rays can be used to visualize the fistula after injection of a radiopaque *contrast medium, usually through an opening in the skin after inserting a catheter, to see the extent of a fistula and the structures with which it communicates. In *haemodialysis patients, contrast is injected through a needle into the vessels around the surgical fistula to look for blockages or narrowings that are compromising flow. *Magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice for examining fistulae around the rectum and anus.

fistuloplasty n. a technique to open up a narrowed arteriovenous *fistula by surgery or by inserting an angioplasty *balloon into the narrowed area and stretching it open. See declotting.

fixation n. 1. (in psychoanalysis) a failure of psychological development, in which traumatic events prevent a child from progressing to the next developmental stage. See also psychosexual development. 2. a procedure for the hardening and preservation of tissues or microorganisms to be examined under a microscope. Fixation kills the tissues and ensures that their original shape and structure are retained as closely as possible. It also prepares them for sectioning and staining. The specimens can be immersed in a chemical *fixative or subjected to *freeze drying.

fixative (fixing agent) n. a chemical agent, e.g. alcohol or osmium tetroxide, used for the preservation and hardening of tissues for microscopical study. See fixation.

flap n. 1. (in surgery) a strip of tissue dissected away from the underlying structures but left attached at one end so that it retains its blood and nerve supply in a *pedicle. The flap is then used to repair a defect in another part of the body by suturing its free end into the area. When the flap has ‘healed into’ its new site the other end can be detached and the remainder of the flap can be sewn in, depending on the type of flap being used. Flaps are commonly used by plastic surgeons in treating patients who have suffered severe skin and tissue loss after mutilating operations (e.g. mastectomy; see TRAM flap) or after burns or injuries not amenable to repair by split skin grafting (see skin graft). Skin flaps may also be used to cover the end of a bone in an amputated limb. In neurosurgery combined skin and bone (osteoplastic) flaps are commonly raised to provide access to the cranium. 2. (in dentistry) a piece of mucous membrane and periosteum attached by a broad base. It is lifted back to expose the underlying bone and enable a procedure such as surgical *extraction or *apicectomy to be performed. It is subsequently replaced and stabilized using sutures during the healing period.

Fleischer ring a deposit of iron in the form of a ring in the epithelium of the cornea, which is seen, for example, around the base of the ‘cone’ of the cornea in *keratoconus. It is best visualized using cobalt blue light. [B. Fleischer (1848–1904), German physician]

Fleischner criteria internationally recognized recommendations for the follow-up for incidentally discovered nodules on a CT scan of the chest that may be early carcinomas. This is designed for nodules smaller than 8 mm and not amenable to biopsy. The patients are divided into low- and high-risk groups. Risk stratification will depend on smoking history and other factors, such as asbestos exposure. Nodules are divided into four groups: less than 4 mm, 4–6 mm, 6–8 mm, and 8 mm or larger. Low-risk patients with nodules smaller than 4 mm receive no follow-up; for larger nodules or in high-risk patients scans are performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months according to size and risk levels. [F. Fleischner (1893–1969), Austrian-born US radiologist]

Multiple long fluid levels are seen in loops of small bowel that are obstructed. A fluid level in the lung suggests a cavity that is partially filled with fluid (e.g. an abscess).

fluke n. any of the parasitic flatworms belonging to the group Trematoda. Adult flukes, which have suckers for attachment to their host, are parasites of humans, occurring in the liver (liver flukes; see Fasciola), lungs (see Paragonimus), gut (see Heterophyes), and blood vessels (blood flukes; see Schistosoma) and often cause serious disease. Eggs, passed out with the host’s stools, hatch into larvae called *miracidia, which penetrate an intermediate snail host. Miracidia give rise asexually to *redia larvae and finally *cercariae in the snail’s tissues. The released cercariae may enter a second intermediate host (such as a fish or crustacean); form a cyst (*metacercaria) on vegetation; or directly penetrate the human skin.

The ions enter enamel during its formation, and after tooth eruption by surface absorption, forming hydroxyfluorapatite. The addition of fluoride to public water supplies is called *fluoridation. Fluoride may also be applied topically in toothpaste or by a dentist. If the water supply contains too little fluoride, fluoride salts may be given to children in the form of mouthwashes, drops, or tablets.

fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) n. a variant of normal glucose in the body that is not metabolized and therefore accumulates in areas of high metabolism, such as tumours and areas of infection. It can be labelled with radioactive fluorine-18 and is in common use in PET scanning (see positron emission tomography).

More rarely, both members are delusional and elaborate their delusions or hallucinations together. More than two people may be involved (folie à trois, folie à quatre, etc.). Treatment usually involves separation of the affected people and management according to their individual requirements. The inducer usually requires antipsychotic medication. See also delusion by proxy; double delusion.

folinic acid a derivative of folic acid involved in purine synthesis. It is used to reverse the biological effects of methotrexate and other *dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors and so to prevent excessive toxicity. This action is termed folinic acid rescue.

Food-borne infections are caused by bacteria of the genera *Salmonella, *Campylobacter, and *Listeria in foods of animal origin. The disease is transmitted by human carriers who handle the food, by shellfish growing in sewage-polluted waters, or by vegetables fertilized by manure. Toxin-producing bacteria causing food poisoning include those of the genus Staphylococcus, which rapidly multiply in warm foods; pathogenic *Escherichia coli; and the species Clostridium perfringens, which multiplies in reheated cooked meals. A rare form of food poisoning – *botulism – is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which may contaminate badly preserved canned foods. See also gastroenteritis.

forceps n. a pincer-like instrument designed to grasp an object so that it can be held firm or pulled. Specially designed forceps – of which there are many varieties – are used by surgeons and dentists in operations (see illustration). The forceps used in childbirth are so designed as to fit firmly round the baby’s head without damaging it. Dental extraction forceps are specially designed to fit the various shapes of teeth. By having long handles and short beaks they provide considerable leverage.

Types of forceps.

foundation training (dental foundation training, DFT) a period of supervised training for dentists in general practice before they are allowed to work independently in the NHS. Foundation training is undertaken after graduation from dental school and lasts 1–2 years. In Scotland it is known as vocational training.

foundation trusts (foundation hospitals) self-governing NHS organizations established under the Health and Social Care Act 2003. Foundation trusts were intended to be accountable to their local communities and *NHS Improvement rather than to central government, while remaining subject to inspection by the *Care Quality Commission in the same way as other health-care providers. In recent years, however, many foundation trusts have required additional government funding due to financial deficits, with the result that central government has regained a large degree of financial and planning control. In practice, few differences now remain between foundation trusts and other NHS acute trusts.

Fourier domain OCT see spectral domain optical coherence tomography.

four principles an approach to medical ethics, proposed by Tom Beauchamp and James F. Childress, that identifies four basic tenets of ethical practice, namely: respect for *autonomy, *beneficence, *nonmaleficence, and *justice. Although the four principles are often used as a framework for decision-making in Western medical ethics, there may be problems when principles conflict or their application is contested in practice.

fovea n. (in anatomy) a small depression, especially the shallow pit in the retina at the back of the eye. It contains a large number of *cones and is therefore the area of greatest acuity of vision: when the eye is directed at an object, the part of the image that is focused on the fovea is the part that is most accurately registered by the brain. See also macula.

foveola n. (in anatomy) a small depression.

FPL test see forced preferential looking test.

fractional flow reserve (FFR) a technique used to quantify the severity of a coronary artery narrowing. During *cardiac catheterization, a specialized wire is passed down the coronary artery to measure pressure. The ratio of the pressure measured downstream of the narrowing to the pressure measured upstream is derived (this ratio also applies to coronary flow). When the ratio is below a certain threshold, flow restriction by the narrowing is deemed to be significant and *percutaneous coronary intervention is likely to be beneficial.

fracture n. breakage of a bone, either complete or incomplete. A simple fracture involves a clean break with little damage to surrounding tissues and no break in the overlying skin. If the overlying skin is perforated and there is a wound extending to the fracture site, the fracture is open, and there is a risk of infection (see osteomyelitis). Treatment of a simple fracture includes realignment of the bone ends where there is displacement, immobilization by external splints or internal fixation, followed by *rehabilitation. See also Colles’ fracture; comminuted fracture; greenstick fracture; pathological fracture; scaphoid fracture; Smith’s fracture; stress fracture.

Affected males have unusually high foreheads, unbalanced faces, large jaws, long protruding ears, and large testicles. They have an IQ below 50 and are prone to violent outbursts. Folic acid helps to control their behaviour. About one-third of the females with this mutation on one of their two X chromosomes also show developmental delay. Screening for the characteristic chromosome can be done by *amniocentesis or *chorionic villus sampling.

freeze drying a method for the *fixation of histological specimens, involving a minimum of chemical and physical change. Specimens are immersed in isopentane cooled to –190°C in liquid air. This fixes the tissue instantly, without the formation of large ice crystals (which would cause structural changes). The tissue is then dehydrated in a vacuum for about 72 hours at –32.5°C.

freeze etching a technique for preparing specimens for electron microscopy. The unfixed tissue is frozen and then split with a knife and a layer of ice is sublimed from the exposed surface. The resultant image is thus not distorted by chemical fixatives.

Frei test a rarely used diagnostic test for the sexually transmitted disease *lymphogranuloma venereum. A small quantity of the virus, inactivated by heat, is injected into the patient’s skin. If the disease is present a small red swelling appears at the site of injection within 48 hours. [W. S. Frei (1885–1943), German dermatologist]

fremitus n. vibrations or tremors in a part of the body, detected by feeling with the fingers or hand (*palpation) or by listening (*auscultation). The term is most commonly applied to vibrations perceived through the chest when a patient breathes, speaks (vocal fremitus), or coughs. The nature of the fremitus gives an indication as to whether the chest is affected by disease. For example, loss of vocal fremitus suggests the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity; its increase suggests consolidation of the underlying lung.

frenuloplasty n. a surgical procedure performed to loosen the fold of skin on the underside of the penis (frenulum), which connects the glans to the prepuce, when this is abnormally tight.

frenulum n. see fraenum.

frenum n. see fraenum.

Compared with *Alzheimer’s disease, a younger population is affected (age 55–65) and more cases have a genetic cause.

frostbite n. damage to the tissues caused by freezing. The affected parts, usually the nose, fingers, or toes, become pale and numb. Ice crystals form in the tissues, which may thus be destroyed, and amputation may become necessary. Frostbitten parts should not be rubbed, since there is no blood circulation in the tissues, but they may be gently warmed in tepid water. Precautions must be taken against bacterial infection, to which frostbitten skin is highly susceptible.

frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) a well-defined disorder characterized by progressive pain and then stiffness of the shoulder that has no clear single cause and usually resolves spontaneously over about 18 months. It may occur after trauma and is more common with diabetes mellitus. Initial treatment during the painful inflammatory phase is with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. During the stiff phase, when the pain and inflammation has settled, gentle physiotherapy and possible manipulation under anaesthesia is performed to help regain range of motion.

frozen watchfulness the state of a child who is unresponsive to its surroundings but is clearly aware of them. The child is usually expressionless and difficult to engage but of normal intelligence. Frozen watchfulness is usually a marker of *child abuse.

Fuchs’ endothelial dystrophy a hereditary condition in which the corneal endothelium loses its functional ability, usually with age. It may result in thickening and swelling of the cornea (*bullous keratopathy) and thus affect vision. Cornea guttata, small whitish deposits of hyalin, are seen on the inner surface of the cornea and signify a reduced number of endothelial cells. A corneal transplantation (see keratoplasty) may become necessary in certain cases. [E. Fuchs (1851–1913), German ophthalmologist]

Nissen fundoplication (named after Swiss surgeon Rudolf Nissen, 1896–1981) consists of a complete (360-degree) wrap; toupe fundoplication is a partial (270-degree) wrap. Fundoplication is now more often performed laparoscopically than via open surgery.

fundoscopy (ophthalmoscopy) n. examination of the interior of the eye by means of an *ophthalmoscope.

fundus n. 1. the base of a hollow organ: the part farthest from the opening; e.g. the fundus of the stomach, bladder, or uterus. 2. the interior concavity forming the back of the eyeball, opposite the pupil. Fundus flavimaculatus is a hereditary disease of the retina in which white material is deposited in the fundus at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (see retina). It usually causes loss of central vision, but good vision may persist into adulthood. Fundus albipunctatus is a hereditary disease in which the fundus shows widespread distribution of uniform-sized white dots, resulting in poor *dark adaptation.

fungating adj. describing or relating to a mass of malignant tissue that has infiltrated the epithelium and broken through the skin surface.

futile adj. describing an intervention with little or no prospect of achieving its aim or intended purpose, often used to justify withholding or withdrawing medical treatment at the end of life. Claims that treatment is futile may be controversial because of the inherent uncertainty of prognoses, value judgments about quality of life, and contested therapeutic aims. Intensive care, for example, cannot be said to be futile simply on the grounds that the patient is unlikely to regain full health, since restoration of full health was never the intended purpose. —futility n.

Bile passes (via the common hepatic duct) to the gall bladder from the liver, where it is formed, and is released into the duodenum (through the common bile duct) under the influence of the hormone *cholecystokinin, which is secreted when food is present in the duodenum. The gall bladder is a common site of stone formation (see gallstone).

The gall bladder. Showing details of associated ducts.





gallium n. a silvery metallic element. A radioisotope of gallium can be used with *nuclear medicine techniques for the detection of lymphomas and areas of infection (such as an abscess) following intravenous injection.

gallstone n. a hard mass composed of bile pigments, cholesterol, and calcium salts, in varying proportions, that can form in the gall bladder. The formation of gallstones (cholelithiasis) occurs when the physical characteristics of bile alter so that cholesterol is less soluble or there is an excess of bile pigments. Diminished contractility of the gall bladder may also be a contributory factor, leading to biliary stasis. Gallstones may exist for many years without causing symptoms. However, they may cause severe pain (see biliary colic) or they may pass into the common bile duct and cause obstructive *jaundice or *cholangitis. Gallstones are usually diagnosed by ultrasonography, but those containing calcium may be seen on a plain X-ray (opaque stones). Symptomatic cholelithiasis is usually treated by surgical removal of the gall bladder (see cholecystectomy). Nonsurgical treatments, such as gallstone-dissolving drugs or lithotripsy, have proved less successful and are not in widespread use.

galvanism n. (formerly) any form of medical treatment using electricity. Interrupted galvanism is a form of *electrotherapy in which direct current, in impulses lasting for 30 to 100 milliseconds, is used to stimulate the activity of nerves or the muscles they supply. See also faradism.

gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) a procedure for assisting conception, suitable only for women with healthy Fallopian tubes. In over 50% of women in whom infertility is diagnosed, the tubes are normal but some other factor, such as endometriosis, prevents conception. Using needle *aspiration, under laparoscopic or ultrasonic guidance, ova are removed from the ovary. After being mixed with the partner’s spermatozoa, they are introduced into a Fallopian tube, where fertilization takes place. The fertilized ovum can subsequently become implanted in the uterus.

gametocide n. a drug that kills *gametocytes. Drugs such as *primaquine destroy gametocytes of the malaria parasite (see Plasmodium), so interrupting the life cycle and preventing infection of the mosquito.

gaming disorder a pattern of behaviour characterized by impaired control over digital gaming, increased priority given to gaming over other interests and activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment of personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months. Gaming disorder was first introduced as a diagnostic entity in ICD-11 in 2018. It is estimated that around 2% of people who regularly play digital games are affected. Treatment follows the principles of other *addiction treatments.

gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) an amino acid found in the central nervous system, predominantly in the brain, where it acts as an inhibitory *neurotransmitter.

gammaglobulin any of a class of proteins, present in the blood *plasma, identified by their characteristic rate of movement in an electric field (see electrophoresis). Almost all gammaglobulins are *immunoglobulins. Injection of gammaglobulin provides temporary protection against *hepatitis A and reduces the incidence of coronary artery involvement in *Kawasaki disease. Infusions of gammaglobulin are used to treat immunodeficiencies or immune-mediated disorders, such as autoimmune haemolytic *anaemia or *idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. See also globulin.

gamma knife a device that allows high doses of radiation in the form of gamma rays to be accurately focused on pathological tissue, with less risk of damaging adjacent normal tissue compared with conventional radiotherapy. Multiple cobalt-60 sources deliver the gamma irradiation. The device is used in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas, certain brain tumours, vascular lesions of the brain, trigeminal neuralgia, and some forms of epilepsy.

gamma rays ionizing electromagnetic radiation of short wavelength given off by certain radioactive substances with equivalent properties to artificially produced X-rays. Gamma rays used in *nuclear medicine tend to have higher energy than diagnostic X-rays, with greater penetration; they are harmful to living tissues and can be used to sterilize certain materials and to kill bacteria as a means of food preservation. Higher energies are used in *radiotherapy with sufficient energy to kill tumour cells by causing breaks in DNA strands.

gamo- combining form denoting marriage.

ganciclovir n. an antiviral drug used to treat severe *cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, including CMV retinitis, in immunocompromised patients and also *dendritic ulcers.

gangrene n. death and decay of part of the body due to deficiency or cessation of blood supply. The causes include disease, injury, or *atheroma in major blood vessels, frostbite or severe burns, and diseases such as *diabetes mellitus and *Raynaud’s disease. Dry gangrene is death and withering of tissues caused simply by a cessation of local blood circulation. Moist gangrene (also known as wet gangrene) is death and putrefactive decay of tissue caused by bacterial infection. See also gas gangrene.

Ganser syndrome a syndrome characterized by approximate answers, i.e. the patient gives grossly and absurdly false replies to questions, but the reply shows that the question has been understood. For example, the question “What colour is snow?” may elicit the reply “Green”. This can be accompanied by odd behaviour or episodes of *stupor. The condition may be due to *conversion disorder or to conscious malingering, especially (historically) in prisoners. [S. J. M. Ganser (1853–1931), German psychiatrist]

Gardner–Diamond syndrome (painful bruising syndrome, psychogenic purpura) a rare disorder, characterized by unexplained, recurrent, and painful bruising, typically arising after physical and/or psycho-emotional stress. Classically, ecchymoses spontaneously appear and are associated with a prodrome of warmth and pain at the sites. The condition, which is seen primarily in young to middle-aged women, is induced by trauma and associated with *personality disorders. Research into the syndrome is sparse but recent publications suggest that only a minority of patients experience a serious reduction in their quality of life, that the condition seems to be dermal rather than systematic in most patients, and that it seems to be associated with ongoing stress. [L. K. Diamond (1902–1999), US paediatrician; F. H. Gardner (1919–2013), US haematologist]

Gardnerella n. a genus of anaerobic bacteria. G. vaginalis is a cause of *bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis and, in pregnant women, of late miscarriage and premature labour.

Gardner’s syndrome a variant form of familial adenomatous *polyposis in which polyps in the colon are associated with fibromas, *sebaceous cysts, and *osteomas (benign tumours), especially of the skull and jaw. [E. J. Gardner (1909–89), US physician]

gargoylism n. see Hunter’s syndrome; Hurler’s syndrome.

Gartner’s duct cysts vaginal cysts, usually small, that arise from Gartner’s duct – remnants of the Wolffian duct (see mesonephros) in females. No treatment is necessary if the cysts are small and not symptomatic, but surgical *marsupialization or excision may be required if they are large and cause obstruction. [H. T. Gartner (1785–1827), Danish surgeon and anatomist]

gas gangrene death and decay of wound tissue infected by the soil bacterium *Clostridium perfringens. Toxins produced by the bacterium cause putrefactive decay of connective tissue with the generation of gas. Treatment is usually by surgery.

Gasterophilus n. a genus of widely distributed non-bloodsucking beelike flies. The parasitic maggots normally live in the alimentary canal of horses but, rarely, can also infect humans and cause an inflamed itching eruption of the skin (see creeping eruption).

gastr- (gastro-) combining form denoting the stomach. Examples: gastrocolic (relating to the stomach and colon); gastrointestinal (relating to the stomach and intestines).

gastrectasia n. pathological dilatation of the stomach. This may be caused by gastric outlet obstruction or it may occur as a complication of previous abdominal surgery, trauma, or overeating.

gastrectomy n. a surgical operation in which the whole or a part of the stomach is removed. Total gastrectomy, in which the oesophagus is joined to the jejunum, is usually performed for stomach cancer but occasionally for the *Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In partial (or subtotal) gastrectomy the upper part of the stomach is joined to the duodenum or small intestine (gastroenterostomy); this operation (with vagotomy) was the definitive treatment for refractory peptic ulcer before the advent of *antisecretory drugs. It is still performed in the treatment of gastric antral disease. After gastrectomy capacity for food is reduced, sometimes leading to weight loss. Other complications of gastrectomy include *dumping syndrome, ulceration at the anastomosis, anaemia, and *malabsorption.

gastric adj. relating to or affecting the stomach.

gastric banding a form of *bariatric surgery in which a band is placed around the stomach to effectively reduce its size and therefore restrict the amount of food it can accommodate. Weight loss should result. The procedure can be performed either in open operation or laparoscopically. The bands can be of a fixed size or adjustable (to vary calorie intake) by means of a small reservoir situated under the skin into which fluid can be injected or removed by the patient.

gastric bypass surgery any of several procedures of *bariatric surgery that allow food to bypass parts of the gut in order to reduce absorption of nutrients and calories. Such operations often lead to greater weight loss than restrictive procedures, such as *gastric banding and *stomach stapling, but there are significant long-term complications relating to chronic malabsorption and patients must remain under long-term specialist follow-up.

gastric glands tubular glands that lie in the mucous membrane of the stomach wall. There are three varieties: the cardiac, parietal (oxyntic), and pyloric glands, and they secrete *gastric juice.

gastric juice the liquid secreted by the *gastric glands of the stomach. Its main digestive constituents are hydrochloric acid, mucin, *rennin, and pepsinogen. The acid acts on pepsinogen to produce *pepsin, which functions best in an acid medium. The acidity of the stomach contents also kills unwanted bacteria and other organisms that have been ingested with the food. Gastric juice also contains *intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12.

gastric stapling see stomach stapling.

gastric ulcer an ulcer in the stomach, caused by the action of gastric acid and pepsin, on the stomach lining (mucosa). The output of stomach acid is not usually increased. Taking *NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and the presence of *Helicobacter pylori are important predisposing factors. Symptoms include vomiting and pain in the upper abdomen soon after eating, and such complications as bleeding (see also haematemesis), *perforation, and obstruction due to scarring may occur. Symptoms are relieved by antacid medicines, but most ulcers heal if treated by an *antisecretory drug. Surgery may be required if the ulcer fails to heal. Since stomach cancer may mimic a gastric ulcer, all gastric ulcers should be examined at endoscopy and biopsies should be taken for histopathological analysis.

gastrin n. a hormone produced in the mucous membrane of the pyloric region of the stomach (see G-cell). Its secretion is stimulated by the presence of food. It is circulated in the blood to the rest of the stomach, where it stimulates the production of *gastric juice.

gastrinoma n. a rare tumour that secretes the hormone gastrin, which stimulates excessive gastric acid production. Such tumours most frequently occur in the pancreas; about half of them are malignant. Patients present with intractable gastroduodenal ulceration, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea (the *Zollinger–Ellison syndrome). Gastrinomas may be a feature of *MENS type 1.

gastritis n. inflammation of the lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Acute erosive (reactive) gastritis is caused by ingesting excess alcohol, protracted NSAID use, or following major surgery, illness, or burns. Chronic gastritis is predominantly caused by *Helicobacter pylori infection, but there are associations with smoking, chronic alcoholism, and biliary reflux. Atrophic gastritis, in which the stomach lining is atrophied, may complicate chronic gastritis or may occur secondary to *autoimmune disease, often in association with pernicious anaemia, and is strongly associated with the development of gastric cancer.

gastro- combining form. See gastr-.

gastrocnemius n. a muscle that forms the greater part of the calf of the leg (see illustration). It flexes the knee and foot (so that the toes point downwards).

Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.





gastrocolic reflex a wave of peristalsis produced in the colon by introducing food into a fasting stomach.

gastroduodenoscope n. see gastroscope.

gastroduodenoscopy n. see oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.

gastroduodenostomy n. a surgical operation in which the *duodenum (usually the third or fourth part) is joined to an opening made in the stomach in order to bypass an obstruction (such as *pyloric stenosis) or to facilitate the exit of food from the stomach after vagotomy. Much more commonly a *gastrojejunostomy or *gastroenterostomy is performed. See also duodenostomy.

gastroenteritis n. inflammation of the stomach and intestine. It is usually due to acute viral or bacterial infection or to the ingestion of toxins in contaminated foods (see food poisoning). Clinical symptoms are vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever. The illness usually lasts 3–5 days. Fluid loss is sometimes severe, especially at the extremes of age, and intravenous fluid replacement may be necessary. Viral or viral-type organisms (e.g. the *norovirus) are common causes of highly infectious gastroenteritis and, unlike bacterial pathogens, can be spread by aerosol or minimal contact and not necessarily by the faeco-oral route.

gastroenterology n. the study of gastrointestinal disease, which encompasses disease of any part of the digestive tract, the liver and biliary tract, and the pancreas.

gastroenterostomy n. a surgical operation in which the small intestine is joined to an opening made in the stomach. The usual technique is *gastrojejunostomy to bypass obstruction (such as *pyloric stenosis).

Gastrografin n. trade name for meglumine diatrizoate, a water-soluble *contrast medium used in diagnostic radiology, usually in the gastrointestinal tract. It is used in some conditions as a laxative.

gastroileac reflex the relaxation of the *ileocaecal valve caused by the presence of food in the stomach.

gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) a rare type of sarcoma arising from the gastrointestinal tract (usually the stomach), characterized by the presence of the receptor c-kit/CD117 on the surface of the tumour cells, which stimulates division of these cells. It displays a wide range of malignant behaviour. Specific treatment is available with *tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

gastrojejunostomy n. a surgical operation in which the *jejunum is joined to an opening made in the stomach. This is usually done in preference to *gastroduodenostomy. See also jejunostomy.

gastrolith n. a stone in the stomach, which usually builds up around a *bezoar.

gastro-oesophageal reflux the process in which the stomach contents transiently reflux into the oesophagus. Reflux is a normal process but pathological reflux (see gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) gives rise to symptoms and complications.

gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) a condition characterized by excessive *gastro-oesophageal reflux, which occurs due to the impairment of neuromuscular mechanisms (such as the lower oesophageal sphincter) designed to minimize reflux. Symptoms range from *heartburn and acid reflux to difficulty or pain when swallowing, nocturnal cough, and chronic throat symptoms. Complications include erosive *oesophagitis, oesophageal strictures, and the development of *Barrett’s oesophagus, a premalignant condition.

gastro-oesophagostomy n. a surgical operation in which the oesophagus (gullet) is joined to the stomach, bypassing the natural junction when this is obstructed by *achalasia, *stricture (narrowing), or cancer. This operation is rarely performed.

gastroparesis n. a condition in which the stomach fails to empty at an appropriate rate into the small intestine. Symptoms of bloating, nausea, early satiety, and vomiting are often intermittent in the early stages but can worsen to be a constant feature. It is most commonly seen in long-standing diabetes after the development of neuropathy affecting the parasympathetic nerves to the stomach.

gastropexy n. surgical attachment of the stomach to the abdominal wall.

gastroplasty n. surgical alteration of the shape of the stomach without removal of any part. The term was originally used for correction of an acquired deformity, e.g. narrowing due to a peptic ulcer, but has more recently been applied to techniques for reducing the size of the stomach in the treatment of morbid obesity, e.g. vertical banded gastroplasty (see stomach stapling) and *gastric banding.

gastroschisis n. a congenital defect in the abdominal wall, which during fetal development fails to close to the right of a normal umbilical cord. Bowel herniates through the defect and has no covering; free loops of bowel can be seen floating in the amniotic cavity on ultrasound. Treatment is surgical. Compare exomphalos.

gastroscope n. an illuminated optical endoscope used to inspect the interior of the gullet (oesophagus), stomach, and duodenum. For many years these were rigid or semi-rigid instruments affording only limited views, but their modern counterparts are flexible instruments that house advanced digital systems to allow high-definition imaging of the oesophagus, stomach, and the proximal segments of the duodenum. Biopsies can be taken of visualized areas of mucosal abnormality, and therapeutic procedures (e.g. to stop a bleeding ulcer, remove a polyp, insert a *gastrostomy, dilate a stricture, or insert a self-expandable metal stent) may be performed. As the same instruments can usually be introduced into the duodenum they are also known as gastroduodenoscopes or oesophagogastroduodenoscopes. —gastroscopy n.

gastrostomy n. a procedure in which an artificial opening is made through the anterior abdominal wall into the stomach to allow direct access for feeding or gastric decompression. A gastrostomy is performed when swallowing is considered unsafe or impossible, due either to neurological disease (such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or motor neuron disease) or to obstruction by a tumour. It is often used temporarily after operations on the oesophagus or head and neck area until healing has occurred. Formerly a gastrostomy was always performed surgically, but it can now be done using an *endoscope (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG) or by direct puncture under radiological guidance (radiologically inserted gastrostomy, RIG).

gastrotomy n. a procedure during abdominal surgery in which the stomach is opened, usually to allow inspection of the interior (e.g. to find a point of bleeding), to remove a foreign body, or to allow the oesophagus to be approached from below (e.g. to pull down a tube through a constricting growth).

gastrula n. an early stage in the development of many animal embryos. It consists of a double-layered ball of cells formed by invagination and movement of cells in the preceding single-layered stage (blastula) in the process of gastrulation. It contains a central cavity, the *archenteron, which opens through the blastopore to the outside. True gastrulation only occurs in the embryos of amphibians and certain fish, but a similar process occurs in the embryonic disc in other vertebrates, including humans.

gating n. a method for acquiring images during specific parts of a fast-moving cycle. Cardiac gating and respiratory gating are used to avoid the movement artifact produced during the cardiac cycle and respiratory movement, respectively. Therefore the area imaged, for example during the R wave on an *electrocardiogram, appears static. The imaging is usually correlated with a physiological measure, such as an ECG trace. Gating is used in CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine.

Gaucher’s disease a genetically determined (autosomal *recessive) disease resulting from the deposition of glucocerebrosides (see cerebroside) in the brain and other tissues (especially bone). It results in learning disability, abnormal limb posture and spasticity, and difficulty with swallowing. Carrier detection and *preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible; enzyme replacement therapy may be used in treatment. [P. C. E. Gaucher (1854–1918), French physician]

gauss n. a unit of magnetic flux density equal to 1 maxwell per square centimetre. 1 gauss = 10−4 tesla.

Gaussian distribution see frequency distribution; significance. [K. F. Gauss (1777–1855), German mathematician]

gauze n. thin open-woven material used in several layers for the preparation of dressings and swabs.

gavage n. forced feeding: any means used to get an unwilling or incapacitated patient to take in food by mouth, especially via a stomach tube.

GAVE (gastric antral vascular ectasia) a condition characterized by the presence of dilated capillaries or veins in the lining of the distal stomach (the gastric *antrum), which may extend to involve the whole of the stomach. It may be diffuse or it may adopt a more linear appearance like the stripes of a watermelon (watermelon stomach). Certain medical conditions (e.g. *cirrhosis, *systemic sclerosis, and chronic renal failure) are associated with this condition. It is often asymptomatic but can lead to transfusion-dependent anaemia. Treatment focuses on management of the underlying condition and endoscopic treatment of bleeding areas using *argon plasma coagulation or laser thermocoagulation.

G-cell n. any of the gastrin-secreting cells of the stomach lining located predominantly in the gastric *antrum. Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells in the stomach. Increased G-cell activity is associated with the formation of duodenal ulcers and the *Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

GCS see Glasgow Coma Scale.

GDC see General Dental Council.

gefitinib n. see epidermal growth factor receptor; tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

gel n. a colloidal suspension that has set to form a jelly. Some insoluble drugs are administered in the form of gels.

gelatin n. a jelly-like substance formed when tendons, ligaments, etc. containing *collagen (a protein) are boiled in water. Gelatin has been used in medicine as a source of protein in the treatment of malnutrition, in pharmacy for the manufacture of capsules and suppositories, and in bacteriology for preparing culture media.

gemcitabine n. a *cytotoxic drug that has an established role in the treatment of lung, pancreatic, bladder, and breast cancers. Side-effects are less severe than those of other *antimetabolites.

gemeprost n. a *prostaglandin drug, administered to terminate pregnancy. It causes powerful contractions of the uterus at any stage of pregnancy.

gemfibrozil n. a drug used to lower levels of *very low-density lipoproteins in patients with *hypertriglyceridaemia who have not responded to diet, weight reduction, or exercise (see fibrates). Side-effects include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting.

gemmule n. one of the minute spines or surface extensions of a *dendrite, through which contact is made with another neuron at a *synapse.

gender dysphoria a condition in which an individual belongs to one gender on the basis of physical appearance and genetics but identifies psychologically with the other gender. The name was introduced in DSM-5; in DSM-IV-TR it was called gender identity disorder. The condition is diagnosed only where there is evidence of strong and persistent cross-gender identification and discomfort about one’s sex, these cause significant distress and social impairment, and there is no concurrent endocrine disorder. Treatment may include counselling, hormone therapy, and gender reassignment surgery. See also transgender.

gene n. the basic unit of genetic material, which is carried at a particular place on a *chromosome. Originally it was regarded as the unit of inheritance and mutation but is now usually defined as a sequence of *DNA or *RNA that acts as the unit controlling the formation of a single polypeptide chain (see cistron). In diploid organisms, including humans, genes occur as pairs of *alleles. Various kinds of gene have been discovered: structural genes determine the biochemical makeup of the proteins; regulator genes control the rate of protein production (see operon). Architectural genes are responsible for the integration of the protein into the structure of the cell, and temporal genes control the time and place of action of the other genes and largely control the *differentiation of the cells and tissues of the body.

gene clone see clone.

General Dental Council (GDC) (in Britain) a statutory body that regulates dental professionals and maintains standards for the benefit of patients.

general dental services a part of the NHS dental service. Dentists are included on the National Performer List and may be *independent contractors or employed. Dental care is commissioned on the basis of units of dental activity (UDAs), a banding system that is scored according to the complexity of the treatment.

general health questionnaire (GHQ) a reliable screening tool published in 1978 for identifying minor psychiatric disorders, still frequently used for research in the general population. The 28-question version (GHQ28) is most commonly used, but the GHQ is available in lengths from 12 to 60 questions.

general household survey a rolling survey carried out annually (1971–2007) in Great Britain by the *Office for National Statistics. It included questions about the household and questions to be completed by all individuals aged over 16 within the household. It covered a wide variety of topics, such as health, employment, pensions, education, and income. It was succeeded (2007–12) by the general lifestyle survey. See also census.

generalized anxiety disorder a condition characterized by inappropriate and sometimes severe anxiety, without adequate cause, that lasts for at least six months. It affects about 2% of the population, women twice as often as men, and often develops in early adult life. It can, however, start at any age. There is a hereditary tendency to develop the disorder and about 25% of immediate relatives of sufferers are also affected. The disorder is thought to be caused by a disturbance of the functions of neurotransmitters, such as adrenaline or GABA, in the frontal lobes or the *limbic system of the brain. Symptoms affect all parts of the body. Palpitations, sweating, tremor, and dry mouth are core symptoms; additional symptoms include giddiness, *bruxism, restlessness, fatigability, breathlessness, lightheadedness, headaches, pins and needles, chest pain, fear of imminent death or losing control, diarrhoea, flushing, dysphagia, cramps, and muscle ache. Treatment includes *cognitive behavioural therapy and medication (*SSRIs or *SNRIs).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire see GAD-7.

/// General Medical Council (GMC) the regulatory body of the medical profession in the UK, which was established in 1858 by the Medical Act and has statutory powers. It licenses doctors to practise medicine and has the power to revoke licences or place restrictions on practice. The governing body of the GMC, its Council, comprises 12 members, 6 of which are medically qualified and 6 of which are not. Its purpose is to protect, promote, and maintain the health and safety of the public by ensuring proper standards in the practice of medicine and medical education and training. Following various high-profile cases involving malpractice, there has been a shift in the role of the GMC from one of simple registration to that of *revalidation of doctors.

general paralysis of the insane (GPI, general paresis) a stage of tertiary *syphilis characterized by *dementia and spastic weakness of the limbs (paresis). Deafness, epilepsy, and *dysarthria may occur. The infecting organism can be detected in the brain cells and tests for syphilis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid are usually positive. When the symptoms are combined with those of *tabes dorsalis, the resulting condition is called tabo-paresis. The condition is now rare due to widespread treatment of earlier stages with penicillin and other antibiotics.

general practitioner (GP) a doctor working in the community who provides family health services to a local area. General practitioners (also known as family doctors or family practitioners) may work on their own or in a group practice in which they share premises and other resources with one or more other doctors. GPs are usually the first port of call for most patients with concerns about their health. They look after patients with wide-ranging medical conditions and can refer patients with more complex problems to specialists, such as hospital consultants. Some GPs with additional training and experience in a specific clinical area take referrals for assessment and treatment that may otherwise have been referred directly to hospital consultants; these are known as GPs with a special interest (GPwSI or GPSI). Most GPs work solely within the *National Health Service but a few work completely privately. The current model of general practice allows for GPs to provide general medical services (GMS), the terms and conditions of which are governed by a national contract which is usually negotiated on an annual basis, or personal medical services (PMS), the terms and conditions of which are governed by locally negotiated contracts within a broad framework. The new primary care contract (nGMS contract) came into force in April 2004, allowing GPs to opt out of weekend and night (*out-of-hours) service provision for patients registered with their practice. In this period, patient care is usually provided by an out-of-hours cooperative or deputizing service. At the same time the government also introduced the *Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) as a means to improve the quality of care provided. Most GPs are *independent contractors although more recently there has been an increase in the number of salaried GPs. GPs may employ a variety of staff, including *practice nurses, *nurse practitioners, and counsellors.

general practitioner with special interest (GPwSI, GPSI) see general practitioner.

generic 1. adj. denoting a nonproprietary drug name, which is not protected by a trademark (see proprietary name). 2. adj. of or relating to a *genus. 3. n. a drug sold under its nonproprietary name.

-genesis combining form denoting origin or development. Example: spermatogenesis (development of spermatozoa).

gene therapy treatment directed to curing genetic disease by introducing normal genes into patients to overcome the effects of defective genes, using techniques of *genetic engineering. The most radical approach would be to do this at a very early stage in the embryo, so that the new gene would be incorporated into the germ cells (ova and sperm) and would therefore be inheritable. However, this approach is not considered to be either safe or ethical, because the consequences would affect all descendants of the patient, and it is not being pursued. In somatic cell gene therapy the healthy gene is inserted into *somatic cells (such as the *haemopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow) that give rise to other cells. All the surviving descendants of these modified cells will then be normal and, if present in sufficient numbers, the condition will be cured (the defective gene will, however, still be present in the germ cells).

At present, gene therapy is most feasible for treating disorders caused by a defect in a single recessive gene, so that the deficiency can be overcome by the introduction of a normal allele (therapy for disorders caused by dominant genes (e.g. Huntington’s disease) would require the modification or replacement of the defective allele as its effect is expressed in the presence of a normal allele). Examples of such recessive disorders include *adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency and *cystic fibrosis. Gene therapy trials for the former condition have already begun: lymphocyte stem cells are isolated from the patient, using *monoclonal antibodies, and incubated with *retroviruses that have been genetically engineered to contain the normal ADA gene (see vector). This gene thus becomes integrated into the stem cells, which – when returned to the patient’s bone marrow – can then produce normal lymphocytes. A similar technique has been used in treating patients with *severe combined immune deficiency and is feasible for other blood disorders, such as sickle-cell anaemia and thalassaemia.

Clinical trials for the gene therapy of cystic fibrosis involve using *liposomes to introduce the normal gene into the lungs of sufferers via an inhaler.

Gene therapy for certain types of cancer is also undergoing clinical trials. Here the approach is aimed at introducing into the cancer cells tumour-suppressing genes, such as *p53 (which prevents uncontrolled cell division), or genes that direct the production of substances (such as *interleukin 2) that stimulate the immune system to destroy the tumour cells.

genethics n. the study of the social, moral, and political implications of knowledge and practice in genetics and genomics.

genetic code the code in which genetic information is carried by *DNA and *messenger RNA. This information determines the sequence of amino acids in every protein and thereby controls the nature of all proteins made by the cell. The genetic code is expressed by the sequence of *nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid molecule, a unit of three consecutive bases (a codon) coding for each amino acid. The code is translated into protein at the ribosomes (see transcription; translation). Any changes in the genetic code result in the insertion of incorrect amino acids in a protein chain, giving a *mutation.

genetic counselling the procedure by which patients and their families are given advice about the nature and consequences of inherited disorders, the possibility of becoming affected or having affected children, and the various options that are available to them for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of such conditions. Genetic counselling should be available at prenatal and postnatal clinics, and also through family planning clinics.

genetic drift the tendency for variations to occur in the genetic composition of small isolated inbreeding populations by chance. Such populations become genetically rather different from the original population from which they were derived.

genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) the techniques involved in altering the characteristics of an organism by inserting genes from another organism into its DNA. This altered DNA (known as recombinant DNA) is usually produced by isolating foreign genes, often by the use of *restriction enzymes, and inserting them into bacterial DNA, often using viruses as *vectors. Once inserted, the foreign gene may use the cell machinery of its host to synthesize the protein that it originally coded for in the organism it was derived from. For example, the human genes for *insulin, *interferon, and *growth hormone production have been incorporated into bacterial DNA and such genetically engineered bacteria are used in the commercial production of these substances. Some other applications of genetic engineering include DNA analysis, the production of *monoclonal antibodies, and – more recently – *gene therapy.

genetics n. the science of inheritance. It attempts to explain the differences and similarities between related organisms and the ways in which characters are passed from parents to their offspring. Human and medical genetics are concerned with the study of inherited diseases. See also cytogenetics; Mendel’s laws.

genetic screening *screening tests to discover individuals whose *genotypes are associated with specific diseases. Such individuals may later develop the disease itself or pass it on to their children (see carrier). The recent use of genetic screening to diagnose the sex of the fetus so that the parents may ‘choose’ the sex of their children has caused considerable controversy. See also mouthwash test; preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

genogram n. in family *psychotherapy, a family tree and a family history of a particular psychological disorder, which are constructed in view of the whole family to help them understand each other better.

genome n. the total genetic material of an organism, comprising the genes contained in its chromosomes; sometimes the term is used for the basic *haploid set of chromosomes of an organism. The human genome comprises 23 pairs of chromosomes (see Human Genome Project).

genomics n. the branch of genetics concerned with the study of genomes. It includes both the mapping of genomes – and ultimately producing a DNA sequence for any particular organism or individual – and understanding how gene expression is controlled and gene products change under different conditions, including disease states.

genotype n. 1. the genetic constitution of an individual or group, as determined by the particular set of genes it possesses. 2. the genetic information carried by a pair of alleles, which determines a particular characteristic. 3. a gene or pattern of genes the precise details of which are defined. Compare phenotype.

geriatrics n. the branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that occur in old age and with the care of the aged. See also gerontology.

germ n. any microorganism, especially one that causes disease. See also infection.

German measles a mild highly contagious virus infection, mainly of childhood, causing enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck and a widespread pink rash. The disease is spread by close contact with a patient. After an incubation period of 2–3 weeks a headache, sore throat, and slight fever develop, followed by swelling and soreness of the neck and the eruption of a rash of minute pink spots, spreading from the face and neck to the rest of the body. The spots disappear within 7 days but the patient remains infectious for a further 3–4 days. An infection usually confers immunity. As German measles can cause fetal malformations during early pregnancy, girls should be immunized against the disease before puberty. Most children now receive immunization via the *MMR vaccine as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. Medical name: rubella. Compare scarlet fever.

germ cell (gonocyte) any of the embryonic cells that have the potential to develop into spermatozoa or ova. The term is also applied to any of the cells undergoing gametogenesis and to the gametes themselves.

germ cell tumour a tumour arising in *germ cells, commonly in the testis and ovary but also found at other sites. Examples are *teratomas, *seminomas, *dysgerminomas, and *choriocarcinomas. They may be benign or malignant and typically occur in children and young adults. Tumour markers, including *alpha-fetoprotein and beta *human chorionic gonadotrophin, can be used to monitor disease.

germicide n. an agent that destroys microorganisms, particularly those causing disease. See also antibiotic; antifungal; antiseptic; disinfectant.

germinal adj. 1. relating to the early developmental stages of an embryo or tissue. 2. relating to a germ.

germinal epithelium the epithelial covering of the ovary, which was formerly thought to be the site of formation of *oogonia. It is now thought that the oogonia persist in a dormant state from the prenatal period until required in reproductive life.

germinal vesicle the nucleus of a mature *oocyte, prior to fertilization. It is considerably larger than the nucleus of other cells.

germ layer any of the three distinct types of tissue found in the very early stages of embryonic development (see ectoderm; endoderm; mesoderm). The germ layers can be traced throughout embryonic development as they differentiate to form the entire range of body tissues.

germ plasm the substance postulated by 19th-century biologists (notably Weismann) to be transmitted via the gametes from one generation to the next and to give rise to the body cells.

gerontology n. the study of the changes in the mind and body that accompany ageing and the problems associated with them.

Gerstmann’s syndrome a group of symptoms that represent a partial disintegration of the patient’s recognition of his or her *body image. It consists of an inability to name the individual fingers, misidentification of the right and left sides of the body, and inability to write or make mathematical calculations (see acalculia; agraphia). It is caused by disease in the association area of the dominant (usually left) parietal lobe of the brain. [J. G. Gerstmann (1887–1969), Austrian neurologist]

Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker syndrome an autosomal *dominant condition that is caused by a mutation in the *prion protein gene and resembles *Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Patients present with cerebellar dysfunction (*ataxia and *dysarthria) and later develop dementia. They continue to deteriorate over several years, in contrast with patients with CJD, who deteriorate rapidly over periods of less than 12 months. [J. G. Gerstmann]

gestaltism (gestalt psychology) n. a school of psychology, originating in Germany, that regards mental processes as wholes (gestalt, from the German meaning ‘form’ or ‘body’) that cannot be broken down into constituent parts. From this was developed gestalt therapy, which aims at achieving a suitable gestalt within the patient that includes all facets of functioning.

gestation n. the period during which a fertilized egg cell develops into a baby that is ready to be delivered. Gestation averages 266 days in humans (or 280 days from the first day of the last menstrual period). See also pregnancy.

gestational diabetes mellitus diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance that is diagnosed during pregnancy (see glucose tolerance test). Women at increased risk of gestational diabetes include those with a personal history of the condition, obesity, or a family history of diabetes, and those who have had a previously unexplained stillbirth. In most cases gestational diabetes resolves at the end of the pregnancy, but such women are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes thereafter. It is treated by dietary control with or without insulin or metformin to avoid the fetal complications of *macrosomia and hypoglycaemia. See also pregestational diabetes.

gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) a group of disorders spanning the conditions of complete and partial molar pregnancies (see hydatidiform mole) through to the malignant conditions of invasive mole, *choriocarcinoma, and the very rare placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT). If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, most commonly defined as a persistent elevation of *human chorionic gonadotrophin, the condition is described as *gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) a group of disorders characterized by persistence of *gestational trophoblastic disease, with abnormal placental development and very high levels of *human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The chorionic villi are fluid-filled with vacuolation of the placenta and destruction of the normal stroma. GTN is rare in the UK, with a calculated incidence of 1/714 live births. It may develop after a molar pregnancy (see hydatidiform mole), a nonmolar pregnancy, or a live birth. The incidence after a live birth is estimated at 1/50,000. A malignant condition may develop (see choriocarcinoma) if the abnormal tissue is not completely removed and the risk of this is monitored by the fall in hCG levels. Choriocarcinoma complicates approximately 3% of complete moles, although in 50% of cases of choriocarcinoma there is no history of immediately preceding trophoblastic disease. It may also occur following a normal pregnancy. In the UK, there is an effective registration and treatment programme. The programme has achieved impressive results, with high cure (98–100%) and low chemotherapy (5–8%) rates.

gestodene n. a *progestogen used in oral contraceptives in combination with *ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen).

GFR see glomerular filtration rate.

Ghon’s focus the lesion produced in the lung of a previously uninfected person by tubercle bacilli. It is a small focus of granulomatous inflammation, which may become visible on a chest X-ray if it grows large enough or if it calcifies. A Ghon focus usually heals without further trouble, but in some patients tuberculosis spreads from it via the lymphatics, the air spaces, or the bloodstream. [A. Ghon (1866–1936), Czech pathologist]

ghost vessels empty transparent blood vessels that persist in the cornea after regression of the inflammatory process that stimulated their development.

GHQ see general health questionnaire.

ghrelin n. a hormone produced by stomach cells that increases appetite and stimulates secretion of growth hormone (levels increase before meals and decrease thereafter). Its receptors and site of action are in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin levels are lower in obese individuals (suggesting that the hormone does not stimulate eating) and higher in patients with anorexia nervosa.

GI see glycaemic index.

giant cell any large cell, such as a *megakaryocyte. Giant cells may have one or many nuclei.

giant-cell arteritis see arteritis.

Giardia n. a genus of parasitic pear-shaped protozoa inhabiting the human small intestine. They have four pairs of *flagella, two nuclei, and two sucking discs used for attachment to the intestinal wall. Giardia is usually harmless but may occasionally cause diarrhoea (see giardiasis).

giardiasis (lambliasis) n. a disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Giardia lamblia in the small intestine. Individuals become infected by eating food contaminated with cysts containing the parasite. Symptoms include diarrhoea, nausea, bellyache, and flatulence, as well as the passage of pale fatty stools (steatorrhoea). Large numbers of the parasite may interfere with the absorption of food through the gut wall. The disease occurs throughout the world and is particularly common in children; it responds well to oral doses of *metronidazole.

gibbus (gibbosity) n. a sharply angled curvature of the backbone, resulting from collapse of a vertebra. Infection with tuberculosis was a common cause.

Giemsa’s stain a mixture of *methylene blue and *eosin, used for distinguishing different types of white blood cell and for detecting parasitic microorganisms in blood smears. It is one of the *Romanowsky stains. [G. Giemsa (1867–1948), German chemist]

gift n. something that is given voluntarily to someone, either in exchange or from an unselfish (altruistic) desire to help another. Patients may wish to thank their clinicians by giving a gift. However, some may see this as ‘buying’ future attention, and some health-service employers and authorities have introduced guidelines for staff: clinicians should be clear what they may and may not accept. Altruistic giving remains the way in which transplants or blood products are obtained in the NHS, and buying or selling organs is seen as a potential *harm and so unethical and possibly illegal.

GIFT see gamete intrafallopian transfer.

gigantism n. abnormal growth causing excessive height, most commonly due to oversecretion during childhood of *growth hormone (somatotrophin) by the pituitary gland. In eunuchoid gigantism the tall stature is due to delayed puberty, which results in continued growth of the long bones before their growing ends (epiphyses) fuse. See also Sotos syndrome.

GIK regime see Alberti regime.

Gilbert’s syndrome familial unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia: a condition due to a congenital deficiency of the enzyme UDP glucuronyl transferase in liver cells that is inherited as an autosomal *dominant or autosomal *recessive characteristic. Patients become mildly jaundiced, especially if they fast, overexert themselves, or have concomitant infection. Most patients are diagnosed following investigation of mildly abnormal liver function tests. The condition is lifelong but of little clinical consequence. [N. A. Gilbert (1858–1927), French physician]

Gilles de la Tourette syndrome see Tourette’s syndrome.

Gillick competence the means by which to assess legal *capacity in children under the age of 16 years, established in the case Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority (1985) 2 A11 ER 402. Such children are deemed to be capable of giving valid *consent to advice or treatment without parental knowledge or agreement provided they have sufficient understanding to appreciate the nature, purpose, and hazards of the proposed treatment. In the Gillick case the criteria for deciding competence, set out by Lord Fraser, related specifically to contraceptive treatment. In addition to the elements of Gillick competence, the Fraser guidelines specified that a health professional must be convinced that the child was likely to begin, or to continue having, sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment, that his or her physical and/or mental health would probably suffer in the absence of treatment, and it was in his or her best interests to provide treatment. The principle of Gillick competence applies to all treatment for those under the age of 16, not just contraceptive services. —Gillick-competent adj.

Gimbernat’s ligament a portion of the medial end of the *inguinal ligament that is reflected along the upper part of the pubic bone. It is used to hold stitches during repairs of a femoral *hernia. [A. de Gimbernat (1734–1816), Spanish surgeon and anatomist]

gingiv- (gingivo-) combining form denoting the gums. Example: gingivoplasty (plastic surgery of).

gingiva n. (pl. gingivae) the gum: the layer of dense connective tissue and overlying mucous membrane that covers the alveolar bone and necks of the teeth. —gingival adj.

gingivectomy n. the surgical removal of gum tissue. This is a specific procedure of periodontal surgery, performed to reduce the depth of a *periodontal pocket or to bring the margin of a crown to above gum level.

gingivitis n. a reversible inflammation of the gums (see gingiva) caused by *plaque on the surfaces of the teeth at their necks. The gums are swollen and bleed easily. Chronic gingivitis can be an early precursor to *periodontal disease but is reversible with good oral hygiene. *Ulcerative gingivitis is painful and destructive. Gingival overgrowth may be caused by drug therapy, e.g. phenytoin, or hormones during pregnancy.

ginglymus (hinge joint) n. a form of *diarthrosis (freely movable joint) that allows angular movement in one plane only, increasing or decreasing the angle between the bones. Examples are the knee joint and the elbow joint.

gladiolus n. the middle and largest segment of the *sternum.

gland n. an organ or group of cells that is specialized for synthesizing and secreting certain fluids, either for use in the body or for excretion. There are two main groups of glands: the *exocrine glands, which discharge their secretions by means of ducts, and the *endocrine glands, which secrete their products – hormones – directly into the bloodstream. See also secretion.

glanders (equinia) n. an infectious disease of horses, donkeys, and mules that is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas mallei and can be transmitted to humans. Symptoms include fever and inflammation (with possible ulceration) of the lymph nodes (a form of the disease known as farcy), skin, and nasal mucous membranes. In the untreated acute form death may follow in 2–20 days. In the more common chronic form, many patients survive without treatment. Administration of antibiotics is usually effective.

glandular fever an infectious disease, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, that affects the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin. In the western world it mainly affects adolescents and young adults; in developing countries young children are most affected. After an incubation period of 5–7 days, symptoms commence with swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes, fever, headache, a sore throat, lethargy, and loss of appetite. In some cases the liver is affected, causing *hepatitis, or the spleen is enlarged. Glandular fever is diagnosed by the presence of large numbers of *monocytes in the blood. Complications are rare but symptoms may persist for weeks before recovery. Medical name: infectious mononucleosis.

glans (glans penis) n. the acorn-shaped end part of the *penis, formed by the expanded end of the corpus spongiosum (erectile tissue). It is covered by the prepuce (foreskin), unless this has been removed by circumcision. The term glans is also applied to the end of the *clitoris.

glansectomy n. a surgical procedure that involves excising the *glans, which preserves the penis and is an option for men with penile cancer.

glare n. the undesirable effects of scattered stray light on the retina, causing reduced contrast and visual performance as well as annoyance and discomfort. Glare is most commonly caused by cataract or corneal opacity

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS, Glasgow scoring system) a numerical system used to estimate a patient’s level of consciousness after head injury. Each of the following are numerically graded: eye opening (1–4), motor response (1–6), and verbal response (1–5). The higher the score, the greater the level of consciousness: a score of 7 indicates a coma.

glass ionomer a dental filling material that is based on a *cement of a silicate glass and an organic acid.

glatiramer n. a drug that modifies the body’s immune response and is used to reduce the frequency of relapses in people with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. Side-effects include flushing and palpitations.

glaucoma n. a condition of the *optic nerve in which a loss of retinal nerve fibres leads to loss of vision. The most significant and manageable risk factor is the pressure in the eye. There are two types of primary glaucoma (in which no other ocular disease is present): acute and chronic simple. In acute (or angle-closure) glaucoma, there is an abrupt rise in pressure due to sudden closure of the angle of the anterior chamber between the cornea and iris where aqueous humour usually drains from the eye. This is accompanied by sudden and severe pain with marked blurring of vision associated with inflammation of the anterior segment. In the more common chronic simple (or open-angle) glaucoma, the pressure increases gradually, usually without any symptoms, and the visual loss is insidious. The same type of visual loss may also occur in eyes with a normal pressure: this is called normal (or low-tension) glaucoma. Primary glaucoma occurs increasingly with age and is an important cause of blindness. It is frequently hereditary. Secondary glaucoma may occur when other ocular disease impairs the normal circulation of the aqueous humour and causes the intraocular pressure to rise.

In all types of glaucoma the aim of the treatment is to reduce the intraocular pressure. Drugs used for this purpose include beta blockers (e.g. timolol, levobunolol, carteolol), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. brinzolamide, dorzolamide), alpha-receptor stimulants (e.g. apraclonidine, brimonidine), and prostaglandin analogues (e.g. latanoprost, bimatoprost, travaprost, tafluprost). They can be used in the form of eye drops. If the medical treatment is ineffective, surgery may be performed to allow the aqueous humour to drain from the eye in sufficient quantities to enable the pressure to return to normal. Such operations may either make a new channel through which the aqueous drains (known as drainage or filtering operations) or involve the insertion of a narrow tube (tube surgery).

glaukomflecken pl. n. small anterior subcapsular lens opacities seen in acute (angle-closure) glaucoma.

Gleason grade the grade (from one to five) given to an area of prostate cancer, reflecting the level of differentiation of the tumour. The tumour pattern is assessed by examining the gland at low magnification. Higher grades indicate poorer differentiation. [D. F. Gleason (1920–2008), US pathologist]

Gleason score a numerical score from two to ten, which is the sum of the two *Gleason grades given to the most common and second most common pattern of prostate cancer seen in the tumour.

gleet n. a discharge of purulent mucus from the penis or vagina resulting from chronic *gonorrhoea.

glenohumeral adj. relating to the glenoid cavity and the humerus: the region of the shoulder joint.

glenoid cavity (glenoid fossa) the socket of the shoulder joint: the pear-shaped cavity at the top of the *scapula into which the head of the humerus fits.

gli- (glio-) combining form denoting 1. glia. 2. a glutinous substance.

glia (neuroglia) n. the special connective tissue of the central nervous system, composed of different cells, including the *oligodendrocytes, *astrocytes, ependymal cells (see ependyma), and *microglia, with various supportive and nutritive functions. Glial cells outnumber the neurons by between five and ten to one, and make up some 40% of the total volume of the brain and spinal cord. —glial adj.

Types of glia.

gliclazide n. the most commonly prescribed *sulphonylurea oral hypoglycaemic drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

gliding joint see arthrodic joint.

glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme) n. the most aggressive type of brain tumour derived from non-nervous (glial) tissue (see astrocytoma). Its rapid enlargement destroys normal brain cells, with a progressive loss of function, and raises intracranial pressure, causing headache, vomiting, and drowsiness. Treatment is never curative and the prognosis is poor.

glioma n. any tumour of non-nervous cells (*glia) in the nervous system. The term is sometimes also used for all tumours that arise in the central nervous system, including *astrocytomas and *glioblastomas. Tumours of low-grade malignancy produce symptoms by pressure on surrounding structures; those of high-grade malignancy may be infiltrative.

gliosome n. a *lysosome in an *astrocyte.

glipizide n. a short-acting drug used to control high blood-glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) in patients with type 2 diabetes after diet control has failed (see sulphonylurea). Side-effects are hypoglycaemia, nausea and vomiting, and skin rash.

Glivec n. see imatinib.

global ethics an approach to moral problems acknowledging that ethical analysis is frequently culture-specific and geographically limited. The international and worldwide experience of health care is the subject of study and there is commonly close attention to inequities in health and health-care provision, with frequent emphasis on *human rights, *justice, and *equality.

globin n. a protein, found in the body, that can combine with iron-containing groups to form *haemoglobin (which is found in red blood cells) and *myoglobin (found in muscle).

globulin n. one of a group of simple proteins that are soluble in dilute salt solutions and can be coagulated by heat. A range of different globulins is present in the blood (the serum globulins, including alpha (α), beta (β), and *gamma (γ) globulins). Some globulins have important functions as antibodies (see immunoglobulin); others are responsible for the transport of lipids, iron, or copper in the blood. See also hormone-binding globulins.

globulinuria n. the presence in the urine of globulins.

globus n. a spherical or globe-shaped structure; for example the globus pallidus, part of the lenticular nucleus in the brain (see basal ganglia).

globus hystericus see globus pharyngeus.

globus pharyngeus a common condition characterized by a sensation of a lump in the throat, in the midline just above the sternum; swallowing is not affected. The condition, formerly called globus hystericus, is sometimes related to *gastro-oesophageal reflux and tends to be worse during periods of stress.

glomangioma n. See glomus tumour. See also glomus.

glomerular filtration rate (GFR) the rate at which substances are filtered from the blood of the glomeruli into the Bowman’s capsules of the *nephrons. It is calculated by measuring the *clearance of specific substances (e.g. creatinine) and is an index of renal function. See eGFR.

glomerulonephritis (glomerular nephritis, GN) n. inflammation of the glomeruli, although in practice the term is used for a number of glomerular conditions lacking microscopical signs of inflammation. For instance, *membranous nephropathy is often referred to as membranous glomerulonephritis. GN may be a primary disease, restricted in its clinical manifestations to the kidney, or part of a multisystem disorder, such as systemic *lupus erythematosus or *vasculitis. Its presentation may be acute, with a *nephritic or *nephrotic syndrome; subacute, with rapidly declining renal function over a period of days or weeks; or chronic, with signs of the disease picked up on routine medical examination. Abnormalities of urine analysis are to be expected, with blood, protein, and casts present in variable amounts. Arterial hypertension is a common associated finding. GN is classified according to the different patterns of histological injury seen on renal biopsy specimens; these are examined by light and electron microscopy and by immunofluorescent studies.

glomerulus n. (pl. glomeruli) 1. the network of blood capillaries contained within the cuplike end (Bowman’s capsule) of a *nephron. It is the site of primary filtration of waste products from the blood into the kidney tubule. 2. any other small rounded mass.

glomus jugulare a collection of *paraganglion cells in close relation to the internal jugular vein at its origin at the base of the skull. It is a site of origin for *glomus tumours (see also paraganglioma).

glomus tumour 1. a benign tumour arising from *paraganglion cells associated with the vagus or glossopharyngeal nerves in the neck (see paraganglioma). In the middle ear they are called glomus tympanicum tumours; around the jugular vein they are called glomus jugulare tumours. 2. (glomangioma) a harmless but often painful tumour produced by malformation and overgrowth of a *glomus, usually in the skin at the ends of the fingers or toes. It may be cauterized or removed surgically.

gloss- (glosso-) combining form denoting the tongue. Examples: glossopharyngeal (relating to the tongue and pharynx); glossoplasty (plastic surgery of).

glossa n. see tongue.

glossectomy n. surgical removal of the tongue, an operation usually carried out to remove a tumour.

Glossina n. see tsetse.

glossitis n. inflammation of the tongue. Causes include anaemia, candidiasis, and vitamin deficiency. See also geographical tongue.

glossolalia n. nonsense speech that mimics normal speech in that it is appropriately formed into an imitation of syllables, words, and sentences. It can be uttered in *trance states and during sleep.

glossopharyngeal nerve the ninth *cranial nerve (IX), which supplies motor fibres to part of the pharynx and to the parotid salivary glands and sensory fibres to the posterior third of the tongue and the soft palate.

glossoplegia n. paralysis of the tongue.

glottis n. the space between the two *vocal folds. The term is often applied to the vocal folds themselves or to that part of the larynx associated with the production of sound.

GLP-1 receptor agonists a group of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They mimic the actions of *glucagon-like peptide-1 in regulating the rise in blood glucose levels after eating and they also enhance satiety (see incretin). As these drugs respond to a falling blood glucose level there is a reduced tendency to *hypoglycaemia compared with *sulphonylurea drugs and insulin therapy itself. They are given by subcutaneous injection and three of them are licensed for use in the UK: exenatide (Byetta; twice daily dosing), liraglutide (Victoza; once daily dosing), and lixisenatide (Lyxumia; once daily dosing).

gluc- (gluco-) combining form denoting glucose. Example: glucosuria (urinary excretion of).

glucagon n. a hormone, produced by the pancreas, that causes an increase in the blood sugar level and thus has an effect opposite to that of *insulin. Glucagon is administered by injection to counteract diabetic *hypoglycaemia.

glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) a hormone – an *incretin – that is produced in the small intestine. GLP-1 has a half-life in the blood circulation of less than two minutes due to rapid breakdown by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). It is a potent antihyperglycaemic hormone, stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells in response to a rising blood glucose level after eating. This glucose-sensitive action also allows the effect of GLP-1 on the beta cells to switch off when the blood glucose level comes down to the normal baseline between meals. Thus the *GLP-1 receptor agonist group of drugs, used in type 2 diabetes, can restrict the rise in blood glucose level after meals but have a low risk of causing subsequent *hypoglycaemia.

glucagonoma n. a usually malignant pancreatic tumour of the alpha cells of the *islets of Langerhans that secretes excessive amounts of glucagon and causes impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, a specific dermatitis, and weight loss.

glucagon stimulation test a test for *phaeochromocytomas not displaying typically high levels of plasma *catecholamines. An intravenous bolus of *glucagon is administered and the test is positive when there is a threefold increase in plasma catecholamine levels with a consequent rise in blood pressure. The test is now very rarely used due to safer and more sensitive screening tests, combined with modern tumour imaging techniques.

glucocorticoid n. see corticosteroid.

glucokinase n. an enzyme (a *hexokinase), found in the liver, that catalyses the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. This is the first stage of *glycolysis.

gluconeogenesis n. the biochemical process in which glucose, an important source of energy, is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids. Gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and kidney and meets the needs of the body for glucose when carbohydrate is not available in sufficient amounts in the diet.

glucosamine n. the amino sugar of glucose, i.e. glucose in which the hydroxyl group is replaced by an amino group. Glucosamine is a component of *mucopolysaccharides and *glycoproteins: for example, *hyaluronic acid, a mucopolysaccharide found in synovial fluid, and *heparin. Glucosamine is taken as a supplement to help manage osteoarthritis.

glucose (dextrose) n. a simple sugar containing six carbon atoms (a hexose). Glucose is an important source of energy in the body and the sole source of energy for the brain. Free glucose is not found in many foods (grapes are an exception); however, glucose is one of the constituents of both sucrose and starch, both of which yield glucose after digestion. Glucose is stored in the body in the form of *glycogen. The concentration of glucose in the blood is maintained at around 5 mmol/l by a variety of hormones, principally *insulin and *glucagon. If the blood-glucose concentration falls below this level neurological and other symptoms may result (see hypoglycaemia). Conversely, if the blood-glucose level is raised above its normal level, to 10 mmol/l, the condition of *hyperglycaemia develops. This is a symptom of *diabetes mellitus.

glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency a hereditary disorder – an X-linked condition (see sex-linked) – in which the absence of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which functions in carbohydrate metabolism, results in the breakdown of the red blood cells (*haemolysis), usually after exposure to *oxidants, such as drugs, or infections. The breakdown causes acute attacks that are characterized by pallor, loin pain, and rigors. There are several varieties of G6PD deficiency, which is most common in people of African, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent. Treatment involves identifying and avoiding agents that trigger the haemolysis and treating acute attacks symptomatically. See also favism.

glucose tolerance test (oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT) the gold-standard diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus and for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (known as prediabetes or abnormal glucose regulation). The blood glucose level is measured after an overnight fast (water only) lasting at least 12 hours, and a second blood glucose level is measured 2 hours after a drink containing 75 g of glucose. The current WHO criteria for normal glucose tolerance is a fasting blood glucose level below 6.1 mmol/l and a two-hour blood glucose level below 7.8 mmol/l. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting level is above 7.0 mmol/l and/or the two-hour level is above 11.1 mmol/l. IGT is diagnosed when the fasting level is less than 7.0 mmol/l and the two-hour level is 7.0–11.1 mmol/l, and IFG when the fasting level is 6.0–7.0 mmol/l but the two-hour level is less than 7.8 mmol/l. People with IGT and IFG have a high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes over time.

glucoside n. see glycoside.

glucuronic acid a sugar acid derived from glucose. Glucuronic acid is an important constituent of *chondroitin sulphate (found in cartilage) and *hyaluronic acid (found in synovial fluid).

glue ear a common condition in which viscous fluid accumulates in the middle ear, causing *deafness. It is most frequently seen in children and is due to malfunction of the *Eustachian tube. Many cases resolve spontaneously; treatment, if required, consists of surgical incision of the eardrum (*myringotomy), drainage of the fluid, and the insertion of a *grommet. Alternatively, hearing aids may be used until spontaneous resolution occurs. Medical names: otitis media with effusion, secretory otitis media.

glutamate dehydrogenase (glutamic acid dehydrogenase) an important enzyme involved in the *deamination of amino acids.

glutamic acid (glutamate) see amino acid; neurotransmitter.

glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) a common enzyme that, because of similarities to certain bacterial proteins, can provoke an autoimmune reaction against the beta cells of the pancreas (see islet cell antibodies) progressing to type 1 *diabetes mellitus.

glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) see aspartate aminotransferase.

glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) see alanine aminotransferase.

glutaminase n. an enzyme, found in the kidney, that catalyses the breakdown of the amino acid glutamine to ammonia and glutamic acid: a stage in the production of urea.

glutamine n. see amino acid.

glutathione n. a peptide containing the amino acids glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. It functions as a *coenzyme in several oxidation-reduction reactions. Glutathione serves as an *antioxidant: it reacts with potentially harmful oxidizing agents and is itself oxidized (see also selenium). This is important in ensuring the proper functioning of proteins, haemoglobin, membrane lipids, etc. High levels of glutathione in the blood are associated with longevity.

glutelin n. one of a group of simple proteins found in plants and soluble only in dilute acids and bases. An example is glutenin, found in wheat (see gluten).

gluten n. a mixture of the two proteins gliadin and glutenin. Gluten is present in wheat and rye and is important for its baking properties: when mixed with water it becomes sticky and enables air to be trapped and dough to be formed. Sensitivity to gluten leads to *coeliac disease in children.

gluteus n. one of three paired muscles of the buttocks (gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus). They are responsible for movements of the thigh. —gluteal adj.

glyc- (glyco-) combining form denoting sugar.

glycaemic index (GI) a ranking system measuring the effect carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion has on blood glucose levels. Glucose is used as the standard reference value (50 g glucose has a GI of 100). A portion of food containing 50 g CHO is ingested and the effect on blood glucose levels measured over a three-hour period and compared with the effect of 50 g of glucose. Foods with a low GI (<60), such as apples, yoghurt, and beans, are slowly absorbed, causing a lower and more prolonged increase in blood glucose levels, than foods with a high GI (>70), e.g. white bread, white rice, and potatoes. Low GI foods help with diabetes control and may be beneficial in the treatment of *polycystic ovary syndrome. The glycaemic load (GL) also takes into account the amount of food that is eaten: GL = (g CHO in food portion eaten × GI)/100.

glycated haemoglobin (glycosylated haemoglobin) any derivative of haemoglobin in which a glucose molecule is attached to the haemoglobin molecule. The most abundant form of glycated haemoglobin is haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), levels of which are significantly increased in diabetes. The percentage of the HbA molecules that become glycated is dependent on the general level of glucose in the plasma over the lifetime of the molecule (generally three months); this percentage is therefore used as the standard measure of the degree of control of *hyperglycaemia in a person with diabetes over this period. HbA1c values are now expressed in mmol per mol haemoglobin (mmol/mol) rather than as a percentage. The use of HbA1c as a screening tool for diabetes mellitus has become recognized.

glycation n. the chemical linkage of glucose to a protein, to form a glycoprotein. Glycation of body proteins has been postulated as a cause of complications of diabetes mellitus. see advanced glycation end-products; glycated haemoglobin.

glyceride n. a *lipid consisting of glycerol (an alcohol) combined with one or more fatty acids. See also triglyceride.

glycerin (glycerol) n. a clear viscous liquid obtained by hydrolysis of fats and mixed oils and produced as a by-product in the manufacture of soap. It is used as an *emollient in many skin preparations, as a laxative (particularly in the form of *suppositories), and as a sweetening agent in the pharmaceutical industry.

glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) a drug that dilates blood vessels and is used mainly to prevent and treat angina (see vasodilator). Side effects may include flushing, headache, and fainting. Glyceryl trinitrate is also applied topically in the treatment of anal fissures.

glycine n. see amino acid.

glycobiology n. the study of the chemistry, biochemistry, and other aspects of carbohydrates and carbohydrate complexes, especially *glycoproteins. Elucidation of the structure and role of the sugar molecules of glycoproteins has important medical implications and has led to the development of new drugs, such as *tissue-type plasminogen activators, drugs that affect the immune system, and antiviral drugs.

glycocholic acid see bile acids.

glycogen n. a carbohydrate consisting of branched chains of glucose units. Glycogen is the principal form in which carbohydrate is stored in the body: it is the counterpart of starch in plants. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles and may be readily broken down to glucose.

glycogenesis n. the biochemical process, occurring chiefly in the liver and in muscle, by which glucose is converted into glycogen.

glycogenolysis n. a biochemical process, occurring chiefly in the liver and in muscle, by which glycogen is broken down into glucose.

glycolipid n. a *lipid containing a sugar molecule (usually galactose or glucose). The *cerebrosides are examples of glycolipids.

glycolysis n. the conversion of glucose, by a series of ten enzyme-catalysed reactions, to lactic acid. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of cells and the first nine reactions (converting glucose to pyruvate) form the first stage of cellular *respiration. The process involves the production of a small amount of energy (in the form of ATP), which is used for biochemical work. The final reaction of glycolysis (converting pyruvate to lactic acid) provides energy for short periods of time when oxygen consumption exceeds demand; for example, during bursts of intense muscular activity. See also lactic acid.

glycopeptide antibiotics see vancomycin.

glycoprotein n. one of a group of compounds consisting of a protein combined with a carbohydrate (such as galactose or mannose). Examples of glycoproteins are certain enzymes, hormones, and antigens.

glycopyrrhonium bromide an *antimuscarinic drug used as a maintenance bronchodilator to relieve symptoms in adults with COPD. It is administered by inhalation; side-effects include dry mouth. Trade name: Seebri Breezhaler.

glycoside n. a compound formed by replacing the hydroxyl (–OH) group of a sugar by another group. (If the sugar is glucose the compound is known as a glucoside.) Glycosides found in plants include some pharmacologically important products, such as the cardiac glycoside *digoxin, derived from the foxglove (Digitalis). Other plant glycosides are natural food toxins, present in cassava, almonds, and other plant products, and may yield hydrogen cyanide if the plant is not prepared properly before eating.

glycosuria n. the presence of glucose in the urine in abnormally large amounts. Only very minute quantities of this sugar may be found normally in the urine. Higher levels may be associated with diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and some other conditions.

goblet cell a column-shaped secretory cell found in the *epithelium of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Goblet cells secrete the principal constituents of mucus.

goitre n. a swelling of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland. This may be due to lack of dietary iodine, which is necessary for the production of thyroid hormone: the gland enlarges in an attempt to increase the output of hormone. This was the cause of endemic goitre, formerly common in regions where the diet lacked iodine. Sporadic goitre may be due to simple overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the gland or to a tumour. In exophthalmic goitre (Graves’ disease) the swelling is associated with overactivity of the gland and is accompanied by other symptoms (see thyrotoxicosis). Autoimmune thyroiditis can be associated with goitre (see Hashimoto’s disease).

gold n. 1. a bright yellow metal that is very malleable. In dentistry pure gold is now very rarely used as a filling. Gold alloys are used for *crowns, *inlays, and *bridges, either alone or veneered with a tooth-coloured material, but increasingly nonprecious alloys are being used. Gold alloys are now only rarely used as the metal framework for partial dentures, *cobalt-chromium alloys being used instead. 2. (in pharmacology) a compound of the metal gold, sodium aurothiomalate, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Side-effects may include blood disorders, severe skin rash and allergy, inflammation of the colon, and kidney damage. Because of this, its use has largely been replaced by methotrexate and biological therapies.

GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) a body that works with health-care professionals and public health officials around the world to raise awareness of *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to improve prevention and treatment of this disease. The publication of management guidelines has had a significant impact on a change in treatment for this condition worldwide.

gonad n. a male or female reproductive organ that produces the gametes. See ovary; testis.

gonadal dysgenesis see Turner’s syndrome.

gonadarche n. the period during which the gonads begin to secrete sex hormones, so triggering puberty. The timing for this event is controlled by the pituitary gland; gonadarche occurs usually between the ages of 10 and 11 in girls and 11 and 12 in boys.

gonadorelin analogue (GnRH analogue, LHRH analogue) any one of a group of analogues of *gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gonadorelin), which stimulates release of the gonadotrophins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. They are more powerful than the naturally occurring hormone, initially increasing the secretion of gonadotrophins by the pituitary: this acts to block the hormone receptors and to inhibit the release of further gonadotrophins, which suppresses production of oestrogens and androgens. Gonadorelin analogues include *buserelin, *goserelin, leuprorelin, and triptorelin. They are used in the treatment of endometriosis, fibroids, and some types of infertility. GnRH analogues are also used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. After causing an initial rise in plasma testosterone for approximately ten days the level then falls to the same low level as that achieved by castration. Because the initial flare in testosterone may cause an acute enlargement of the cancer, *anti-androgens are given usually for the first two weeks following the first injection of the gonadorelin analogue.

gonadotrophin (gonadotrophic hormone) n. any of several hormones synthesized and released by the pituitary gland that act on the testes or ovaries (gonads) to promote production of sex hormones and either sperm or ova. Their production is controlled by *gonadotrophin-releasing hormone. The main gonadotrophins are *follicle-stimulating hormone and *luteinizing hormone. They may be given by injection to treat infertility. See also human chorionic gonadotrophin.

gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH, gonadorelin) a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and transported via the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it controls the synthesis and release of pituitary *gonadotrophins. It may be used to test the ability of the pituitary to produce gonadotrophins. *Gonadorelin analogues are used to treat endometriosis, fibroids, some types of infertility, and prostate cancer.

goniotomy (trabeculotomy) n. a primary surgical procedure for treating congenital glaucoma (see buphthalmos). A fine knife is used to make an incision into the blocked *trabecular meshwork from within the eye, thus creating an opening through which the aqueous fluid can drain.

gonococcus n. (pl. gonococci) the causative agent of gonorrhoea: the bacterium *Neisseria gonorrhoeae. —gonococcal adj.

gonocyte n. see germ cell.

gonorrhoea n. a sexually transmitted disease, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, that affects the genital mucous membranes of either sex. Symptoms develop about a week after infection and include pain on passing urine and discharge of pus (known as gleet) from the penis (in men) or vagina (in women); some infected women, however, experience no symptoms. If a pregnant woman has gonorrhoea, her baby’s eyes may become infected during passage through the birth canal (see ophthalmia neonatorum). In untreated cases, the infection may spread throughout the reproductive system, causing sterility; severe inflammation of the urethra in men can prevent passage of urine (a condition known as *stricture). Later complications include arthritis, inflammation of the heart valves (*endocarditis), and infection of the eyes, causing conjunctivitis. Treatment with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or cefotaxime is usually effective.

good adj. positive, desirable, or morally admirable. The question of what is to be judged good is at the heart of medical ethics and ethics in general. Some theorists believe that one’s intentions or will may or may not be good (see deontology), while others argue that only the consequences of actions may or may not be good (*consequentialism). Physicians have an explicit duty to do good for their patients (see beneficence). See also right.

good enough adequate or satisfactory, particularly when applied to the quality of parental care. The term was introduced by the paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott to discourage professionals from imposing an impossible level as the threshold of adequacy.

Goodpasture’s disease a rare autoimmune illness with production of antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM antibodies). Classically patients present with lung haemorrhage and a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Most cases will respond to aggressive treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. [E. W. Goodpasture (1886–1960), US pathologist]

gooseflesh n. the reaction of the skin to cold or fear. The blood vessels contract and the small muscle attached to the base of each hair follicle also contracts, causing the hairs to stand up: this gives the skin an appearance of plucked goose skin.

GORD see gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

Gordon’s syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, chloride shunt syndrome) an autosomal *dominant condition associated with increased chloride absorption in the distal tubule leading to a syndrome of mild volume expansion, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis with otherwise normal renal function. Plasma *renin and *aldosterone are suppressed as a result of the volume expansion. Other features can include short stature, intellectual impairment, muscle weakness, and renal stones.

goundou (anákhré) n. a condition following an infection with *yaws in which the nasal processes of the upper jaw bone thicken (see hyperostosis) to form two large bony swellings, about 7 cm in diameter, on either side of the nose. The swellings not only obstruct the nostrils but also interfere with the field of vision. Initial symptoms include persistent headache and a bloody purulent discharge from the nose. Early cases can be treated with injections of penicillin; otherwise surgical removal of the growths is necessary. Goundou occurs in central Africa and South America.

gout n. a disease in which a defect in purine metabolism causes an excess of uric acid and its salts (urates) to accumulate in the bloodstream and the joints respectively. It results in attacks of acute gouty arthritis and chronic destruction of the joints and deposits of urates (tophi) in the skin and cartilage, especially of the ears. The excess of urates also damages the kidneys, in which stones may form. Long-term treatment with drugs that increase the excretion of urates (*uricosuric drugs), or with urate-lowering therapy, such as, *allopurinol or *febuxostat, can control the joint disease. Urate-lowering therapy may also help with urate stones, but uricosurics are not used as they can precipitate uric acid stones by increasing uric acid excretion in the urine. Acute attacks of gout are treated with anti-inflammatory analgesics, colchicine, or corticosteroids. See also podagra.

governance n. the use of political power or authority to set, monitor, and enforce standards within systems or organizations. Within the UK National Health Service, there are two principal governance frameworks within which health-care professionals must work: *clinical governance and research governance.

grade n. 1. the severity of a malignant tumour according to its degree of *differentiation. Low-grade tumours (grade 1) closely resemble normal tissues, are well differentiated, and have a good prognosis. High-grade tumours (grade 3) show a poor resemblance to normal tissues, are poorly differentiated, and have a poor prognosis. Benign tumours are not graded. 2. the severity of a non-neoplastic disease.

graded self-exposure a technique used in the *behaviour therapy of phobias. A hierarchy of fears (increasingly fearful stimuli) is set up and the patients expose themselves to each level of the hierarchy in turn. Exposure continues until *habituation occurs; the patient then proceeds to the next highest level of the hierarchy. The patient is ultimately able to cope with the feared object or situation.

graft 1. n. any organ, tissue, or object used for *transplantation to replace a faulty part of the body. A *skin graft is used to heal a damaged area of skin. A *bone graft can be performed using natural bone or a synthetic material. A kidney removed from a live or dead person and transplanted to another individual is described as a kidney (or renal) graft. Corneal grafts are taken from a recently dead individual to repair corneal opacity (see keratoplasty). Diseased coronary arteries may be replaced by a *coronary artery bypass graft. Artificial grafts are used to replace diseased peripheral arteries and heart valves. 2. vb. to transplant an organ or tissue. See also allograft; xenograft.

graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) a condition that occurs following bone marrow transplantation and sometimes blood transfusion, in which lymphocytes from the graft attack specific tissues in the host. The skin, gut, and liver are the most severely affected. Drugs that suppress the immune reaction, such as steroids and *ciclosporin, and antibodies directed against lymphocytes reduce the severity of the tissue damage.

Gram’s stain a method of staining bacterial cells, used as a primary means of identification. A film of bacteria spread onto a glass slide is dried and heat-fixed, stained with a violet dye, treated with decolourizer (e.g. alcohol), and then counterstained with red dye. Gram-negative bacteria lose the initial stain but take up the counterstain, so that they appear red microscopically. Gram-positive bacteria retain the initial stain, appearing violet microscopically. These staining differences are based on variations in the structure of the cell wall in the two groups. [H. C. J. Gram (1853–1938), Danish physician]

grand mal (major epilepsy) see epilepsy.

grand multiparity the condition of a woman who has had five or more previous pregnancies. Such women are more prone to fetal malpresentations, postpartum haemorrhage, and rupture of the uterus.

granisetron n. see ondansetron.

granular cast a cellular *cast derived from a kidney tubule. In certain kidney diseases, notably acute *glomerulonephritis, abnormal collections of renal tubular cells are shed from the kidney, often as a cast of the tubule. The casts can be observed on microscopic examination of the centrifuged deposit of a specimen of urine. Their presence in the urine indicates continued activity of the disease.

granulation n. the formation of a multicellular mass of tissue (granulation tissue) in response to an injury: this is an essential part of the healing process. Granulation tissue contains many new blood vessels and, in its later stages, large numbers of fibroblasts. The response is most frequently seen in healing open wounds and in the bases of ulcers.

granulocyte n. any of a group of white blood cells that, when stained with *Romanowsky stains, are seen to contain granules in their cytoplasm. They can be subclassified on the basis of the colour of the stained granules into *neutrophils, *eosinophils, and *basophils.

granuloma n. (pl. granulomata or granulomas) a localized collection of cells, usually produced in response to an infectious process, that is characterized by the presence of aggregates of epithelioid *histiocytes; giant cells, monocytes, or lymphocytes may also be present. The types of cells comprising a granuloma (of which there may be many or few) and their arrangement can assist in diagnosing the cause of the response; this is important in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Crohn’s disease, and the presence of certain foreign bodies (e.g. starch, talc). Other conditions giving rise to granulomata include syphilis, leprosy, and coccidioidomycosis, and a granuloma may also occur around the apex of a tooth root as a result of inflammation or infection of its pulp. —granulomatous adj.

granuloma annulare a chronic skin condition of unknown cause, which may lie on a disease spectrum with *necrobiosis lipoidica. In the common localized type there is a ring or rings of closely set papules, 1–5 cm in diameter, found principally on the hands and arms. The association with diabetes mellitus is controversial.

It is associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (*ANCA). Untreated the disease is usually fatal, but it can be controlled with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab.

granulopoiesis n. the process of production of *granulocytes, which normally occurs in the blood-forming tissue of the *bone marrow. Granulocytes are ultimately derived from a *haemopoietic stem cell, but the earliest precursor that can be identified microscopically is the *myeloblast. This divides and passes through a series of stages of maturation termed respectively *promyelocyte, *myelocyte, and *metamyelocyte, before becoming a mature granulocyte. See also haemopoiesis.

granzyme n. a *protease enzyme that is released by *cytotoxic T cells and *natural killer cells to induce death of virus-infected target cells.

graph- (grapho-) combining form denoting handwriting.

-graph combining form denoting an instrument that records. Example: electrocardiograph (instrument recording heart activity).

In the brain grey matter forms the *cerebral cortex and the outer layer of the cerebellum; in the spinal cord the grey matter lies centrally and is surrounded by white matter.

grey scale (in radiology) a scale representing the possible gradient of densities from black to white for each *pixel in an image. In an *analogue image this gradient is smooth. A *digital image has many discrete steps. The more steps allowed, the closer to representing the true analogue image it comes, although more steps require more computer memory. Images can be manipulated by *windowing. This concept is particularly valuable in *computerized tomography. See Hounsfield unit; digitization.

ground substance the matrix of *connective tissue, in which various cells and fibres are embedded.

group B streptococcus (GBS) a Gram-positive bacterium that causes life-threatening infections in newborn infants following vaginal delivery (see Streptococcus; Lancefield classification). 20% of pregnant women are carriers and have no symptoms; however, *vertical transmission of the bacterium from mother to fetus at the time of delivery may lead to neonatal sepsis, characterized by pneumonia, meningitis, and death in some cases. Antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin during labour is recommended for women with risk factors or who are known to be carriers.

group practice see general practitioner.

See also psychodrama. 2. therapy in which people with the same problem, such as *alcoholism or *phobias, meet and discuss together their difficulties and possible ways of overcoming them.

growth factor any of various chemicals, particularly polypeptides, that have a variety of important roles in the stimulation of new cell growth and cell maintenance. They bind to the cell surface on receptors and are potential targets for anticancer therapy (see epidermal growth factor receptor). Specific growth factors can cause new cell proliferation (e.g. *transforming growth factor, epidermal growth factor, haemopoietic growth factor) and the migration of cells (fibroblast growth factor) and play a role in wound healing (platelet-derived growth factor; PDGF). Some growth factors act in the embryonic stage of development; for example, *nerve growth factor. Some growth factors that induce cell proliferation are involved in the abnormal regulation of growth seen in cancer when produced in excessive amounts (e.g. insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I). Growth factors produced locally around a carcinoma (e.g. *vascular endothelial growth factor) are important in the encouragement of invasion by the tumour; other factors (e.g. autocrine motility factor, migration-stimulating factor) are also significant. See also bone growth factors.

growth hormone (GH, somatotrophin) a hormone, synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, that promotes growth of the long bones in the limbs and increases protein synthesis (via *somatomedin). Its release is controlled by the opposing actions of growth-hormone releasing hormone and *somatostatin. Excessive production of growth hormone results in *gigantism before puberty and *acromegaly in adults. Lack of growth hormone in children causes *dwarfism. Synthetic human growth hormone (somatotropin) is used to treat a variety of conditions of growth-hormone deficiency. Pegvisomant is an analogue of human growth hormone that blocks GH receptors; it may be used to treat acromegaly.

In the female the ovaries descend only slightly within the abdominal cavity and the gubernacula persist as the round ligaments connecting the ovaries and uterus to the abdominal wall.

guidewire n. wire used as a guide to insert a catheter during interventional procedures, particularly in the *Seldinger technique. Guidewires often have multiple cores and a variety of coverings, depending on their functions, and they vary in stiffness and thickness. Their ends may be curved, to get past tight strictures, or J-shaped, to avoid accidentally puncturing a vessel wall or other structure while being pushed forward.

Guillain–Barré syndrome (postinfective polyneuropathy) a disease of the peripheral nerves in which there is numbness and weakness in the limbs. It usually develops 1–28 days after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (commonly with Campylobacter): antibodies directed against the pathogen’s cell-surface antigens attack similar antigens on the myelin sheaths of the host’s peripheral nerves. Involvement of the respiratory muscles may require mechanical ventilation. Recovery is variable and often prolonged (there is a 10% mortality rate). Treatment with immunoglobulins (intravenous) or with plasma exchange may speed recovery and reduce long-term disability. See polyradiculitis. [G. Guillain (1876–1961) and A. Barré (1880–1967), French neurologists]

guillotine n. (in surgery) 1. an instrument used for removing the tonsils. It is loop-shaped and contains a sliding knife blade. 2. an encircling suture to control the escape of fluid or blood from an orifice or to close a gap.

guinea worm a nematode worm, Dracunculus medinensis, that is a parasite of humans. The white threadlike adult female, 60–120 cm long, lives in the connective tissues beneath the skin. It releases its larvae into a large blister on the legs or arms; when the limbs are immersed in water the larvae escape and are subsequently eaten by tiny water fleas (Cyclops), inside which their development continues. The disease *dracontiasis results from drinking water contaminated with Cyclops.

Gulf War syndrome a variety of symptoms, mainly neurological (including chronic fatigue, dizziness, amnesia, digestive upsets, and muscle wasting), that have been attributed to exposure of armed forces personnel to chemicals (e.g. insecticides) used during the Gulf War (1991) or possibly to the effects of vaccines and tablets given to protect personnel against the anticipated threat of chemical and biological warfare during the conflict. Medical research into the syndrome is continuing.

Haab’s striae splits or tears in *Descemet’s membrane occurring during infancy, commonly as a result of congenital glaucoma. [O. Haab (1850–1931), German ophthalmologist]

habit n. a sequence of learned behaviour occurring in a particular context or as a response to particular events. Habits are often the result of *conditioning, are performed automatically and unconsciously, and reduce decision-making. Habits, once established, often persist after the original causal factors no longer operate. Behavioural psychology is based on the premise that one form of conditioning can be replaced by another.

habituation n. 1. (in psychology) a simple type of learning consisting of a gradual waning response by the subject to a continuous or repeated stimulus that is not associated with *reinforcement. 2. (in pharmacology) the condition of being psychologically dependent on a drug, following repeated consumption, marked by reduced sensitivity to its effects and a craving for the drug if it is withdrawn. See also dependence.

habitus n. an individual’s general physical appearance, especially when this is associated with a constitutional tendency to a particular disease.

haem n. an iron-containing compound (a *porphyrin) that combines with the protein globin to form *haemoglobin, found in the red blood cells.

haem- (haema-, haemo-, haemat(o)-) combining form denoting blood. Examples: haematogenesis (formation of); haemophobia (fear of).

haemagglutination n. the clumping of red blood cells (see agglutination). It is caused by an antibody–antigen reaction or some viruses and other substances.

haemagglutinin (HA, H) a glycoprotein projecting from the surface layer of the lipid bilayer envelope of *influenza virions. This protein is involved in virus binding and may influence virulence. It is a key target for antibody attack and therefore is important in vaccination.

haemangioblastoma (Lindau’s tumour) n. a tumour of the brain or spinal cord arising in the blood vessels of the meninges or brain. It is often associated with *phaeochromocytoma and *syringomyelia. See also von Hippel-Lindau disease.

haemangioma n. a benign tumour of blood vessels. It often appears on the skin as a type of birthmark; the strawberry *naevus is an example. See also angioma.

Haemaphysalis n. a genus of hard *ticks. Certain species transmit tick *typhus in the Old World; H. spinigera transmits the virus causing *Kyasanur Forest disease in India.

haemarthrosis n. bleeding within a joint, which may follow injury or may occur spontaneously in bleeding disorders, such as *haemophilia. It is usually associated with swelling, warmth, and pain in the affected joint. Treatment includes immobilization, pressure bandaging, and correction of the blood disorder (if present). Aspiration of blood from a joint that is tensely swollen may relieve the pain.

haematemesis n. the act of vomiting fresh blood. The blood may have been swallowed (e.g. following a nosebleed or tonsillectomy) but more often arises from bleeding in the oesophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are *oesophageal varices or peptic ulcers. Vomited blood needs to be replaced by transfused blood. Gastroscopy may identify the source of bleeding and enables endoscopic treatments to arrest it. These include adrenaline injection, thermocoagulation with a *heater-probe or by *argon plasma coagulation, band ligation of oesophageal varices, glue injection for gastric varices, and the placement of metallic clips (endoclips) on bleeding vessels.

haemathidrosis (haematidrosis) n. see haematohidrosis.

haematin n. a chemical derivative of *haemoglobin formed by removal of the protein part of the molecule and oxidation of the iron atom from the ferrous to the ferric form.

haematinic n. a drug that increases the amount of *haemoglobin in the blood, e.g. *ferrous sulphate and other iron-containing compounds. Haematinics are used, often in combination with vitamins and folic acid, to prevent and treat anaemia due to iron deficiency. They are used particularly to prevent anaemia during pregnancy. Digestive disturbances sometimes occur with haematinics.

haematochesia n. the passage of fresh red blood through the rectum. Haematochesia occurs in patients with haemorrhoids, colorectal carcinoma, colitis, diverticulitis, angiodysplasia, and volvulus. Haematochesia also occurs as a result of severe haemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

haematocoele n. a swelling caused by leakage of blood into a cavity, especially that of the tunica vaginalis, the membrane overlying the front and sides of the *testis. A pelvic haematocoele is a swelling near the uterus formed by the escape of blood, usually from a Fallopian tube in ectopic pregnancy.

haematocolpos n. distention of the vagina with blood due to an *imperforate hymen. See cryptomenorrhoea.

haematocrit n. see packed cell volume.

haematocyst n. a cyst that contains blood.

haematogenous (haematogenic) adj. 1. relating to the production of blood or its constituents; haematopoietic. 2. produced by, originating in, or carried by the blood.

haematohidrosis (haemathidrosis, haematidrosis) n. the secretion of sweat containing blood.

haematology n. the study of blood and blood-forming tissues and the disorders associated with them. —haematological adj. —haematologist n.

haematoma n. an accumulation of blood within the tissues that clots to form a solid swelling. Injury, disease of the blood vessels, or a clotting disorder of the blood are the usual causative factors. An intracranial haematoma causes symptoms by compressing the brain and by raising the pressure within the skull. A blunt injury to the head, especially the temple, may tear the middle meningeal artery, giving rise to a rapidly accumulating extradural haematoma requiring urgent surgical treatment. In elderly people a relatively slight head injury may tear the veins where they cross the space beneath the dura, giving rise to a subdural haematoma. Excellent results are obtained by surgical treatment. An intracerebral haematoma may be a consequence of severe head injury but is more often due to atheromatous disease of the cerebral arteries and high blood pressure resulting in bleeding into the brain. See also perianal haematoma.

haematometra n. 1. accumulation of menstrual blood in the uterus. 2. any abnormally copious bleeding in the uterus.

haematomyelia n. bleeding into the tissue of the spinal cord. This may result in acutely developing symptoms that mimic *syringomyelia.

haematopoiesis n. see haemopoiesis.

haematoporphyrin n. a type of *porphyrin produced during the metabolism of haemoglobin.

haematosalpinx (haemosalpinx) n. the accumulation of menstrual blood in the *Fallopian tubes.

haematospermia n. the occurrence of blood in the semen, which may be due to one of several benign or malignant urological conditions.

haematoxylin n. a colourless crystalline compound extracted from logwood (Haematoxylon campechianum) and used in various histological stains. When oxidized haematoxylin is converted to haematein, which imparts a blue colour to certain parts of cells, especially cell nuclei. Heidenhain’s iron haematoxylin is used to stain sections that are to be photographed, since it gives great clarity at high magnification.

haematuria n. the passage of blood in the urine. This may be seen by the naked eye (frank, macroscopic, or visible haematuria) or detected by urine microscopy or urine dipstick (microscopic or nonvisible haematuria) The latter is subclassified into symptomatic nonvisible or asymptomatic nonvisible haematuria. Haematuria is a very important symptom because it is associated with *transitional cell carcinoma, most commonly in the bladder, and kidney cancer. It may also be due to urinary-tract infections, stone disease, or some forms of *glomerulonephritis.

haemin n. a chemical derivative of haemoglobin formed by removal of the protein part of the molecule, oxidation of the iron atom, and combination with an acid to form a salt (compare haematin). Chlorohaemin forms characteristic crystals, the identification of which provides the basis of a chemical test for blood stains.

haemo- combining form. see haem-.

Haemobartonella n. see Bartonella.

haemobilia n. haemorrhage into the bile ducts, usually presenting as an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed (with bloody vomit or *melaena) or with a dropping blood count. The most common causes are liver injury, liver biopsy, hepatobiliary surgery, or use of instruments (such as *ERCP). Other causes include gallstones, inflammatory conditions, vascular abnormalities, tumours, and conditions that predispose to bleeding (such as using anticoagulant medication).

haemochromatosis (hereditary haemochromatosis, bronze diabetes, iron-storage disease) n. a hereditary disorder in which there is excessive absorption and storage of iron. This leads to damage and functional impairment of many organs, including the liver, pancreas, and endocrine glands. The main features are a bronze colour of the skin, diabetes, and liver failure. It is inherited as an autosomal *recessive trait in people of northern European descent and is due to mutations in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) in the majority of cases. Iron may be removed from the body by blood letting or an iron *chelating agent may be administered. Compare haemosiderosis.

haemoconcentration n. an increase in the proportion of red blood cells relative to the plasma, brought about by a decrease in the volume of plasma or an increase in the concentration of red blood cells in the circulating blood (see polycythaemia). Haemoconcentration may occur in any condition in which there is a severe loss of water from the body. Compare haemodilution.

haemocytometer n. a special glass chamber of known volume into which diluted blood is introduced. The numbers of the various blood cells present are then counted visually, through a microscope. Haemocytometers have been largely replaced by electronic cell counters.

haemodiafiltration n. a form of renal replacement therapy that removes toxins by a combination of diffusion (as in conventional *haemodialysis) and convection (as in *haemofiltration), and is more efficient than either in the process.

haemodialysis n. a technique of removing waste materials or poisons from the blood using the principle of *dialysis. Haemodialysis is performed on patients whose kidneys have ceased to function; the process takes place in a *dialyser. The stream of blood taken from an artery is circulated through the dialyser on one side of a semipermeable membrane, while a solution of similar electrolytic composition to the patient’s blood circulates on the other side. Water and waste products from the patient’s blood filter through the membrane, whose pores are too small to allow passage of blood cells and proteins. The purified blood is then returned to the patient’s body through a vein.

haemodilution n. a decrease in the proportion of red blood cells relative to the plasma, brought about by an increase in the total volume of plasma. This may occur in a variety of conditions, including pregnancy and enlargement of the spleen (see hypersplenism). Compare haemoconcentration.

haemofiltration n. the use of a transmembrane hydrostatic pressure to induce filtration of plasma water across the membrane of a haemofilter. Solutes dissolved in the plasma water accompany their solvent to a greater or lesser extent dependent on molecular weight and the characteristics of the filter membrane (pore size).

haemoglobin n. a substance contained within the red blood cells (*erythrocytes) and responsible for their colour, composed of the pigment haem (an iron-containing *porphyrin) linked to the protein globin. Haemoglobin has the unique property of combining reversibly with oxygen and is the medium by which oxygen is transported within the body. It takes up oxygen as blood passes through the lungs and releases it as blood passes through the tissues. Blood normally contains 115 to 180 g/l of haemoglobin. See also myoglobin; oxyhaemoglobin.

haemoglobin A1c see glycated haemoglobin.

haemoglobinometer n. an instrument for determining the concentration of *haemoglobin in a sample of blood, which is a measure of its ability to carry oxygen.

haemoglobinopathy n. any of a group of inherited diseases, such as *thalassaemia and *sickle-cell disease, in which there is an abnormality in the production of haemoglobin.

haemoglobinuria n. the presence in the urine of free haemoglobin. The condition occurs if haemoglobin, released from disintegrating red blood cells, cannot be taken up rapidly enough by blood proteins. The condition sometimes follows strenuous exercise. It is also associated with certain infectious diseases (such as blackwater fever), ingestion of certain chemicals (such as arsenic), and injury.

haemogram n. the results of a routine blood test, including an estimate of the blood haemoglobin level, the *packed cell volume, and the numbers of red and white blood cells (see blood count). Any abnormalities seen in microscopic examination of the blood are also noted.

haemolysin n. a substance capable of bringing about destruction of red blood cells (*haemolysis). It may be an antibody or a bacterial toxin.

haemolysis n. the destruction of red blood cells (*erythrocytes). Within the body, haemolysis may result from defects within the red cells or from poisoning, infection, or the action of antibodies; it may occur in mismatched blood transfusions. It usually leads to anaemia. Haemolysis of blood specimens may result from unsatisfactory collection or storage or be brought about intentionally as part of an analytical procedure (see laking).

haemolytic adj. causing, associated with, or resulting from destruction of red blood cells (*erythrocytes). For example, a haemolytic antibody is one that causes destruction of red cells; a haemolytic anaemia is due to red-cell destruction (see anaemia).

haemolytic disease of the newborn the condition resulting from destruction (haemolysis) of the red blood cells of the fetus by antibodies in the mother’s blood passing through the placenta. When an exchange occurs between fetal and maternal blood (as at delivery, placental abruption, threatened miscarriage, or invasive procedures), the passage of red cells into the maternal circulation provokes an antibody response to the fetal red blood cell antigen in the mother. This most commonly happens when the red blood cells of the fetus are Rh positive (i.e. they have the *rhesus factor) but the mother’s red cells are Rh negative. For the rhesus antigen, the primary IgM antibodies (see immunoglobulin) do not cross the placenta, but if the mother is exposed in another pregnancy, IgG antibodies do cross the placenta. This may result in very severe anaemia of the fetus, leading to heart failure with oedema (*hydrops fetalis) or stillbirth. When the anaemia is less severe the fetus may reach term in good condition, but the accumulation of the bile pigment bilirubin from the destroyed cells causes severe jaundice after birth, which may require *exchange transfusion. If untreated, it may cause serious brain damage (see kernicterus). Other red cell antibodies that are clearly associated with fetal anaemia are D, Kell, and c.

A blood test early in pregnancy enables the detection of antibodies in the mother’s blood and the adoption of various precautions for the infant’s safety, including Doppler measurement of the fetal cerebral vessels (MCA Doppler; see Doppler ultrasound) to detect fetal anaemia, which may require intrauterine transfusion. The incidence of the disease has been greatly reduced by preventing the formation of antibodies in a Rh-negative mother (see anti-D immunoglobulin).

haemolytic uraemic syndrome a condition in which sudden rapid destruction of red blood cells (see haemolysis) causes acute renal failure due partly to obstruction of small arteries in the kidneys. The haemolysis also causes a reduction in the number of platelets, which can lead to severe haemorrhage. The syndrome may occur as a result of septicaemia following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (especially by pathogenic *Escherichia coli), eclamptic fits in pregnancy (see eclampsia), or as a reaction to certain drugs. There may also be small sporadic outbreaks of the condition without any obvious cause.

haemoperfusion n. the passage of blood through a sorbent column with the aim of removing toxic substances. The commonest sorbent in use is charcoal, microencapsulated with cellulose nitrate. Haemoperfusion might be considered for the treatment of poisoning with carbamazepine, theophylline, barbiturates, and Amanita mushrooms.

haemopericardium n. the presence of blood within the membranous sac (pericardium) surrounding the heart, which may result from injury, tumours, rupture of the heart (e.g. following myocardial infarction), or a leaking aneurysm. The heart is compressed (see cardiac tamponade) and the circulation impaired; a large fall in blood pressure and cardiac arrest may result. Surgical drainage of the blood may be life saving.

haemoperitoneum n. the presence of blood in the peritoneal cavity, between the lining of the abdomen or pelvis and the membrane covering the organs within.

haemophilia n. either of two hereditary disorders in which the blood clots very slowly, due to a deficiency of either of two *coagulation factors: haemophilia A, due to deficiency of Factor VIII (antihaemophilic factor); or haemophilia B, due to deficiency of Factor IX (Christmas factor). The patient may experience prolonged bleeding following any injury or wound, and in severe cases there is spontaneous bleeding into muscles and joints. Bleeding in haemophilia may be treated by recombinent-DNA-derived Factor VIII or plasma Factor VIII concentrate. Alternatively concentrated preparations of Factor VIII or Factor IX, obtained by freezing fresh plasma, may be administered (see cryoprecipitate). Haemophilia is controlled by a *sex-linked gene, which means that it is almost exclusively restricted to males: women can carry the gene – and pass it on to their sons – without being affected themselves. The genes encoding factors VIII and IX have been used in gene therapy trials for haemophilia. —haemophiliac n.

Haemophilus n. a genus of Gram-negative aerobic nonmotile parasitic rodlike bacteria frequently found in the respiratory tract. They can grow only in the presence of certain factors in the blood and/or certain coenzymes: they are cultured on fresh blood *agar. Most species are pathogenic: H. aegyptius causes conjunctivitis, and H. ducreyi soft sore (chancroid). H. influenzae is associated with acute and chronic respiratory infections (see also epiglottitis) and is a common secondary cause of *influenza infections; H. influenzae type b is an important cause of bacterial *meningitis in young children (see Hib vaccine).

haemophthalmia n. bleeding into the *vitreous humour of the eye: vitreous haemorrhage.

haemopneumothorax n. the presence of both blood and air in the pleural cavity, usually as a result of injury. Both must be drained out to allow the lung to expand normally. See also haemothorax.

haemopoiesis (haematopoiesis) n. the process of production of blood cells and platelets which continues throughout life, replacing aged cells (which are removed from the circulation). In healthy adults, haemopoiesis is confined to the *bone marrow, but in embryonic life and in early infancy, as well as in certain diseases, it may occur in other sites (extramedullary haemopoiesis). See also erythropoiesis; leucopoiesis; thrombopoiesis. —haemopoietic adj.

haemopoietic stem cell the cell from which all classes of blood cells are derived. It cannot be identified microscopically, but can be defined by the presence of a combination of cell-surface proteins. It can be demonstrated by *tissue culture of the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, as well as by growth of human haemopoietic cells in immunodeficient mice strains, such as non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID). See also haemopoiesis.

haemoptysis n. the coughing up of blood. This symptom should always be taken seriously, however small the amount. In some patients the cause is not serious; in others it is never found. But it should always be reported to a doctor.

haemorrhage (bleeding) n. the escape of blood from a ruptured blood vessel, externally or internally. Arterial blood is bright red and emerges in spurts, venous blood is dark red and flows steadily, while damage to minor vessels may produce only an oozing. Rupture of a major blood vessel such as the femoral artery can lead to the loss of several litres of blood in a few minutes, resulting in *shock, collapse, and death, if untreated. See also haematemesis; haematuria; haemoptysis.

haemorrhagic adj. associated with or resulting from blood loss (see haemorrhage). For example, haemorrhagic anaemia is due to blood loss (see anaemia).

haemorrhagic disease of the newborn a temporary disturbance in blood clotting caused by *vitamin K deficiency and affecting infants on the second to fourth day of life. It varies in severity from mild gastrointestinal bleeding to profuse bleeding into many organs, including the brain. It is more common in breast-fed and preterm infants. The condition can be prevented by giving all babies vitamin K, either by injection or orally, shortly after birth. Medical name: melaena neonatorum.

haemorrhoidectomy n. the surgical operation for removing *haemorrhoids, which are tied and then excised. Possible complications are bleeding or, later, anal stricture (narrowing). The operation is usually performed only for second- or third-degree haemorrhoids that have not responded to simple measures.

haemorrhoids (piles) pl. n. enlargement of the normal spongy blood-filled cushions in the wall of the anus (internal haemorrhoids), usually a consequence of prolonged constipation or, less often, diarrhoea. They most commonly occur at three main points equidistant around the circumference of the anus. Uncomplicated haemorrhoids are seldom painful; any pain is usually caused by an anal *fissure. The main symptom is bleeding, and in first-degree haemorrhoids, which never appear at the anus, bleeding at the end of defaecation is the only symptom. Second-degree haemorrhoids protrude beyond the anus as an uncomfortable swelling but return spontaneously; third-degree haemorrhoids remain outside the anus and need to be returned by manipulation.

First- and second-degree haemorrhoids may respond to bowel regulation using a high-fibre diet and faecal softening agents. If bleeding persists, elastic bands may be applied or a sclerosing agent may be injected around the swollen cushions to eradicate them. Third-degree haemorrhoids often require surgery (see haemorrhoidectomy), especially if they become *strangulated (producing severe pain and further enlargement).

External haemorrhoids are either prolapsed internal haemorrhoids or – more often – *perianal haematomas or the residual skin tags remaining after a perianal haematoma has healed.

haemosalpinx n. see haematosalpinx.

haemosiderin n. an iron-storage compound found mainly in the cells of the *macrophage– *monocyte system in the marrow, in the *Kupffer cells of the liver, and in the spleen. It contains around 30% iron by weight.

haemosiderosis n. the accumulation of *haemosiderin in various tissues.

haemostasis n. the arrest of bleeding, involving the physiological processes of *blood coagulation and the contraction of damaged blood vessels. The term is also applied to various surgical procedures (for example the application of *ligatures or *diathermy to cut vessels) used to stop bleeding.

haemostatic (styptic) n. an agent that stops or prevents haemorrhage; for example, *tranexamic acid and *phytomenadione. Haemostatics are used to control bleeding due to various causes.

haemothorax n. blood in the pleural cavity, usually due to injury. If the blood is not drained dense fibrous *adhesions occur between the pleural surfaces, which can impair the normal movement of the lung. The blood may also become infected (see empyema).

haemozoin n. an iron-containing pigment present in the organisms that cause malaria (*Plasmodium species).

hair n. a threadlike keratinized outgrowth of the epidermis of the *skin. It develops inside a tubular hair follicle. The part above the skin consists of three layers: an outer cuticle; a cortex, forming the bulk of the hair and containing the pigment that gives the hair its colour; and a central core (medulla), which may be hollow. The root of the hair, beneath the surface of the skin, is expanded at its base to form the bulb, which contains a matrix of dividing cells. As new cells are formed the older ones are pushed upwards and become keratinized to form the root and shaft. A hair may be raised by a small erector muscle in the dermis, attached to the hair follicle.

hairball n. see trichobezoar.

hair follicle a sheath of epidermal cells and connective tissue that surrounds the root of a *hair.

hair papilla a projection of the dermis that is surrounded by the base of the hair bulb. It contains the capillaries that supply blood to the growing *hair.

hairy cell an abnormal white blood cell that has the appearance of an immature lymphocyte with fine hairlike cytoplasmic projections around the perimeter of the cell. It is found in a rare form of leukaemia (hairy-cell leukaemia) most commonly occurring in young men.

halfway house a residential home for a group of people where some professional supervision is available. It is used as a stage in the rehabilitation of recovering drug addicts and people who are mentally ill, usually when they have just been discharged from hospital or a rehabilitation facility and are able to work but are not yet ready for independent life.

halitosis n. bad breath. Causes of temporary halitosis include recently eaten strongly flavoured food, such as garlic or onions, and drugs such as paraldehyde. Other causes include mouth breathing, *periodontal disease, and infective conditions of the nose, throat, and lungs (especially *bronchiectasis). Constipation, indigestion, acute appendicitis, uraemia, and some liver diseases may also cause the condition. See also fetor.

Hallpike test see Dix–Hallpike test.

hallucination n. a false sensory perception of something that is not really there; the perception is subjectively convincing but lacks an external stimulus. Hallucinations may be visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory (of taste), or olfactory (of smell). They may be provoked by mental illness (such as *schizophrenia or severe anxiety disorders), *personality disorders, or physical disorders affecting the brain (such as temporal lobe *epilepsy, sepsis, acute organic syndrome, or stroke) or they may be caused by drugs, alcohol, or sensory deprivation. Hallucinations should be distinguished from dreams and from *illusions (which are misinterpretations of real stimuli). A substantial minority of the population experiences hallucinations not caused by mental illness. Some hallucinations are not always pathological: hypnagogic hallucinations occur in the state between wakefulness and sleep, and the images are often very distinct; these hallucinations occur in 30–60% of patients with *narcolepsy. Hypnopompic hallucinations occur in the state between sleep and full wakefulness; like hypnagogic hallucinations, the experiences may be very vivid.

hallucinogen n. a drug that produces hallucinations, e.g. *cannabis and *lysergic acid diethylamide. Hallucinogens were formerly used to treat certain types of mental illness. —hallucinogenic adj.

hallux n. (pl. halluces) the big toe.

hallux rigidus painful stiffness and enlargement of the metatarsophalangeal joint, at the base of the big toe, resulting from osteoarthritis. Unlike *hallux valgus, men are more commonly affected than women. Conservative treatment is often successful, but in some cases surgery (e.g. *cheilectomy, *arthrodesis, or *arthroplasty) is required.

hallux valgus the most common foot deformity, usually affecting women, in which the big toe is displaced towards the others (i.e. away from the midline); it is associated with a *bunion. The second toe may become crowded by the big toe and a *hammer toe deformity often results. Treatment includes modified footwear and surgery.

hallux varus displacement of the big toe away from the others (i.e. towards the middle).

haloes pl. n. coloured rings seen around lights by people with acute (angle-closure) glaucoma and sometimes by people with cataract.

haloperidol n. a *butyrophenone antipsychotic drug used to relieve anxiety and tension in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders and also to treat tics and related movement disorders. Muscular incoordination and restlessness are common side-effects.

halophilic adj. requiring solutions of high salt concentration for healthy growth. Certain bacteria are halophilic. —halophile n.

hamartoma n. an overgrowth of mature tissue in which the elements show disordered arrangement and proportion in comparison to normal. The overgrowth is benign but malignancy may occur in any of the constituent tissue elements.

hamate bone (unciform bone) a hook-shaped bone of the wrist (see carpus). It articulates with the capitate and triquetral bones at the sides, with the lunate bone behind, and with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones in front.

Hamman’s sign a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat heard with a stethoscope in 45–50% of patients with *pneumomediastinum. [L. V. Hamman (1877–1946), US physician]

hammer n. (in anatomy) see malleus.

hammer toe a deformity of a toe, most often the second, caused by fixed flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which produces extension of distal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. A corn often forms over the deformity, which may be painful. If severe pain does not respond to strapping or corrective footwear, it may be necessary to perform *arthrodesis at the affected joint.

hamstring n. any of the tendons at the back of the knee. They attach the hamstring muscles (the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus) to their insertions in the tibia and fibula.

hamulus n. (pl. hamuli) any hooklike process, such as occurs on the hamate, lacrimal, and sphenoid bones and on the cochlea.

HAN heroin-associated nephropathy: a syndrome of massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminuria, and hyperlipidaemia, with or without oedema, seen after prolonged intravenous addiction to heroin. Renal biopsies show the changes of *focal segmental glomerulosclerosis but the condition does not respond to immunosuppressant treatment and progresses to end-stage renal failure.

hand n. the terminal organ of the upper limb. From a surgical point of view, the human hand comprises the eight bones of the *carpus (wrist), the five metacarpal bones, and the phalangeal bones plus the surrounding tissues; anatomically, the bones and tissues of the wrist are excluded. The hand is a common site of infections and injuries, many of which are of industrial origin for which compensation may be claimed.

handedness n. the preferential use of one hand, rather than the other, in voluntary actions. Ambidexterity – the ability to use either hand with equal skill – is very rare. Over 95% of right-handed people and 50–70% of left-handed people have left-hemisphere dominance for language.

hand, foot, and mouth disease a self-limiting disease, mainly affecting young children, caused by *Coxsackie virus A16. A feeling of mild illness is accompanied by mouth ulcers and blisters on the hands and feet.

hand–foot syndrome see palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia.

handicap n. the extent to which an individual is disadvantaged by some partial or total *disability when compared with those in a peer group who have no such disability. The term has now fallen into disfavour as it is felt to have negative connotations

Hand–Schüller–Christian disease see Langerhans cell histiocytosis. [A. Hand (1868–1949), US paediatrician; A. Schüller (1874–1958), Austrian neurologist; H. A. Christian (1876–1951), US physician]

Hansen’s bacillus see Mycobacterium. [G. H. A. Hansen (1841–1912), Norwegian physician]

Hansen’s disease see leprosy.

hantavirus n. one of a genus of viruses that infect rats, mice, and voles and cause disease in humans when the secretions or excreta of these rodents are inhaled or ingested. The disease was first reported from the area of the Hantaan river, which separates North from South Korea, but hantavirus infections also occur in Japan, China, Russia, Europe, and the USA: in Britain it can affect farm, nature conservancy, and sewage workers and those engaged in water sports. The symptoms vary according to the strain of the infecting virus. Many patients have a mild influenza-like illness, but severe cases are characterized by high fever, headache, shock, nausea and vomiting, and *petechiae in the skin; there may be kidney pain and rapidly progressive kidney damage leading to kidney failure. A particularly virulent strain in the USA attacks the lungs, leading to rapid respiratory failure. The mortality rate in these severe cases is high.

haploid (monoploid) adj. describing cells, nuclei, or organisms that have a single set of unpaired chromosomes. In humans the gametes are haploid following *meiosis. Compare diploid; triploid. —haploid n.

haplotype n. a complete set of *HLA antigens inherited from either parent.

happy puppet syndrome see Angelman syndrome.

hapt- (hapto-) combining form denoting touch.

hapten n. see antigen.

haptoglobin n. a protein present in blood plasma that binds with free haemoglobin to form a complex that is rapidly removed from the circulation by the liver. Depletion of plasma haptoglobin is a feature of anaemias in which red blood cells are destroyed inside the circulation with the release of haemoglobin into the plasma and its loss in the urine.

harara n. a severe and itchy inflammation of the skin occurring in people continuously subjected to the bites of the *sandfly Phlebotomus papatasii. The incidence of this allergic skin reaction, prevalent in the Middle East, may be checked by controlling the numbers of sandflies.

harelip n. see cleft lip.

harlequin colour change an unusual phenomenon in newborn babies characterized by transient red colour changes to half of the body, well demarcated at the midline. It is seen usually 2–5 days after birth and can last from 30 seconds to 20 minutes before fading away. It may recur when the infant is placed on his or her side as the intensity of the erythema appears to be gravity-dependent.

harm n. physical, mental, or moral damage or the threat of this. Avoiding it is one of the ethical *four principles known as *nonmaleficence. Although health service staff have a clear duty to benefit patients and avoid harming them, in practice almost all medical actions run the risk of harming the patient and in some no good effect can be achieved without a clearly harmful process (such as mastectomy or chemotherapy for breast cancer). Therefore all medical professionals should learn how to make a *risk–benefit analysis at each point of care. The risk of harm should be explained to patients and their agreement obtained at each appropriate point. Professional blame or litigation may result if this is not done and harm results. See also primum non nocere; professionalism.

Harrison’s sulcus a depression on both sides of the chest wall of a child between the pectoral muscles and the lower margin of the ribcage. It is caused by exaggerated suction of the diaphragm when breathing in and develops in conditions in which the airways are partially obstructed (e.g. poorly treated asthma) or when the lungs are abnormally congested due to some congenital abnormality of the heart. [E. Harrison (1789–1838), British physician]

Hartmann’s operation a method of reconstruction after surgical removal of the distal colon and proximal rectum, in which the rectal stump is closed off and the divided end of the colon is brought out as a *colostomy. The technique allows for a second operation to join up the bowel ends and obviates the need for a stoma. It is often used temporarily where primary anastomosis is unsafe (e.g. in cases of perforated *diverticular disease) or permanently as a palliative procedure (e.g. for unresectable colonic cancer). [H. Hartmann (1860–1952), French surgeon]

Hartmann’s pouch a saclike dilatation of the gall-bladder wall near its outlet; it is a common site for finding *gallstones. [R. Hartmann (1831–93), German anatomist]

Hartmann’s solution a *physiological solution used for infusion into the circulation. In addition to essential ions, it also contains glucose. [A. F. Hartmann (1898–1964), US paediatrician]

Hartnup disease a rare hereditary defect in the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan, leading to learning disability, thickening and roughening of the skin on exposure to light, and lack of muscular coordination. The condition is similar to *pellagra. Treatment with nicotinamide is usually effective. [Hartnup, the family in whom it was first reported]

harvest mite see Trombicula.

Hashimoto’s disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis) due to the formation of *thyroid antibodies. Its features include a firm swelling of the thyroid and partial or total failure of secretion of thyroid hormones; often there are autoantibodies to other organs, such as the stomach. Women are more often affected than men and the condition often occurs in families. [H. Hashimoto (1881–1934), Japanese surgeon]

hashish n. see cannabis.

Hasson technique a technique used in laparoscopic surgery in which the skin, muscle, fascia, and peritoneum are incised under direct vision to allow the insertion of a blunt *trocar, through which the laparoscope is introduced. [H. M. Hasson (21st century), US gynaecologist]

haustrum n. one of the pouches on the external surface of the *colon.

Haversian canal one of the small canals (diameter about 50 μm) that ramify throughout compact *bone. See also Haversian system. [C. Havers (1650–1702), English anatomist]

Haversian system one of the cylindrical units of which compact *bone is made. A Haversian canal forms a central tube, around which are alternate layers of bone matrix (lamellae) and lacunae containing bone cells. The lacunae are linked by minute channels (canaliculi).

hay fever a form of *allergy due to the pollen of grasses, trees, and other plants, characterized by inflammation of the membrane lining the nose and sometimes of the conjunctiva (see conjunctivitis). The symptoms of sneezing, running or blocked nose, and watering eyes are due to histamine release and often respond to treatment with *antihistamines. If the allergen is identified, it may be possible to undertake *desensitization. Medical name: allergic rhinitis.

head n. 1. the part of the body that contains the brain and the organs of sight, hearing, smell, and taste. 2. the rounded portion of a bone, which fits into a groove of another to form a joint;

for example, the head of the humerus or femur.

headache n. pain felt deep within the skull. Most headaches are caused by stress or fatigue but some are symptoms of serious intracranial disease. See also cluster headache; migraine.

head injury an injury usually resulting from a blow to the head and often associated with *traumatic brain injury. It may result in *contusion or – if the blood vessels in the head are torn – a *haematoma. The level of consciousness of a patient following a head injury can be monitored using the *Glasgow Coma Scale. Head injuries are an important cause of death due to accidents: legislation to impose protective headgear at industrial sites and on construction workers and motorcyclists has reduced their incidence.

head tilt, chin lift a manoeuvre for opening the airway of an unconscious patient. With the patient lying on his or her back, the neck is extended and the chin simultaneously pulled gently upwards to pull the tongue away from the back of the pharynx. This method is often used when mouth-to-mouth ventilation is to be given and is an alternative to the *jaw thrust manoeuvre.

Heaf test a skin test to determine whether or not an individual is immune to tuberculosis, carried out prior to vaccination. A spring-loaded gun mounted with very short needles produces a circle of six punctures in the forearm through which *tuberculin is introduced. If the test is positive a reaction causes the skin to become red and raised, indicating that the individual is immune. If the test is negative a vaccine (*BCG) should be given. [F. R. G. Heaf (20th century), British physician]

healing n. making whole, both by restoring injured or diseased tissue and, more generally, by returning to full and independent function. The latter may take a lot longer than the former: this is one of the reasons for follow-up after a medical event and for convalescence and rehabilitation services. See also empowerment.

health n. according to the official definition of the World Health Organization, a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Others question whether defining it as an ideal state truly expresses either its practical dynamics or its philosophical complexity.

health-adjusted life expectancy a measure developed by the World Health Organization to capture life expectancy in terms of both morbidity and mortality. The number of years lived with ill-health, weighted according to severity, are subtracted from the overall life expectancy. Previously known as disability-adjusted life expectancy, it is sometimes referred to as healthy life expectancy. See also disability-adjusted life year.

Health and Safety Executive (HSE) (in Britain) a statutory body responsible for health and safety in the workplace (including factories, offices, and farms). See also COSHH.

Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) formerly, an executive nondepartmental public body set up in April 2013 to collect, analyse, and publish UK national health data and supply IT systems and services to health-care providers nationwide. It was rebranded as *NHS Digital in August 2016.

health and wellbeing board (HWB) a statutory local authority committee that aims to improve integration between local health care, social care, and other public service providers. HWBs (of which there are over 130) also have a responsibility to reduce health inequalities and produce a local joint strategic needs assessment to inform commissioning of local services. Each upper-tier local authority is obliged under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to have an HWB, whose membership must include: an elected local representative; the local *Directors of Public Health, adult social services, and children’s social services; and representatives from the local *Healthwatch, each local *clinical commissioning group, and *NHS England.

health authority see National Health Service.

health board a health authority in Wales (since 2003), Scotland, and Northern Ireland. See National Health Service.

health care see primary care; secondary care; tertiary care.

health-care commissioning identifying services required to meet population health-care needs and obtaining such services from an appropriate service provider via allocation of resources and contracting arrangements. Commissioners monitor the quality of commissioned services, including adherence to any appropriate national standards. Most NHS commissioning is undertaken by *clinical commissioning groups or *NHS England.

health centre (in Britain) a building, usually owned or leased by a health authority, that houses personnel and/or services from one or more sections of the *National Health Service (e.g. *general practitioners, *district nurses, dentists, and *child health clinics. Services provided by local authorities, such as social services, may also operate from such a centre. A GP-led health centre (polyclinic) is one where a greater range of health services are available compared to conventional GP practices. They offer extended opening hours and other health services, such as ophthalmology and dentistry, as well as diagnostics, outpatient appointments, urgent care, and community services, such as community mental health care, community nursing, and management of long-term conditions. The main aim is to move more services into the community, thus making them easier to access for patients. Various models have been proposed for polyclinics, ranging from large premises housing many separate GP practices to more extensive facilities with additional services available. See also children’s centre.

health education methods used to inform people (either individually or collectively) and persuade and enable them to adopt lifestyles that the educators believe will improve health and to reject habits regarded as harmful to health. The term is also used in a broader sense to include instruction about bodily function, etc., so that the public is better informed about health issues. All children receive health education at school, often as part of a personal, social, and health education (PSHE) programme. See also health promotion.

Health Education England (HEE) a *special health authority of the NHS responsible for leading education and training for the whole health-care and public health workforce. It was established following the Health and Social Care Act 2012. See also local education and training boards.

health impact assessment (HIA) a systematic process that generally uses existing scientific literature and local geographic and demographic knowledge to judge the potential impact of a project or policy on the health of a population. HIAs are used to assess the likely health impact of many different types of projects or policies, from large construction projects to taxation policies.

health inequalities differences in health-related *variables (e.g. life expectancy, all-age all-cause mortality, breast cancer incidence) between population groups (often defined by socio-economic group, sex, age, ethnic group, place of birth, place of residence, and income). Health inequalities between groups arise as a result of differences in constitutional factors (e.g. age, sex, ethnic group), educational attainment, health-related behaviour (e.g. smoking, diet) and access to services. Typically, socio-economic deprivation is associated with poorer health outcomes. Recent government policy has sought to reduce gaps in health outcomes between population groups, particularly those related to socio-economic group and income.

health maintenance organization (HMO) in the USA, a type of prepaid group medical practice with a defined and restricted patient population. Each enrolled patient pays a fixed fee regardless of the amount of physician services used. The HMO physicians assume responsibility for the health care of the enrolled members and provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services.

health needs assessment (HNA) a systematic process that assesses the health needs of a given population, often with relation to a particular issue (e.g. smoking or alcohol consumption). It aims to lead to policy that allows health resources to be used in the most efficient way.

health promotion action to maintain the best possible health and quality of life of the members of the community and to stimulate their involvement in their personal health, both collectively and individually. Programmes may include interventions targeting individuals and their behaviour, such as *health education, immunization, and *screening tests, and interventions targeting populations, such as environmental monitoring, housing, and water and food supplies.

health protection the branch of *public health medicine that is concerned with protecting the population from communicable diseases, chemicals and poisons, radiation, and other potential threats to health. See Public Health England.

Health Protection Agency (HPA) formerly, a nondepartmental public body set up as a special health authority in 2003 to protect the health of the UK population via advice and support to the NHS, local authorities, the Department of Health, emergency services, and others.

health service manager an administrator with special training and skills in management who is concerned with the planning and provision of health services and with managing performance. Some managers enter the profession via the NHS Graduate Management Training Scheme; for others the basic training is in disciplines other than health; however, doctors, nurses, and others may fill such posts, sometimes combining them with professional appointments. See also National Health Service.

health service planning balancing the health and health-care needs of a community, assessed by such indices as mortality, morbidity, and disability, with the resources available to meet these needs in terms of human resources (including ensuring the numbers in training grades meet future requirements) and technical resources, such as hospitals (capital planning), equipment, and medicines. See also clinical audit.

health visitor a trained nurse with specialist qualifications in *health promotion and public health. The role of the health visitor takes place within the primary health-care team and focuses on families with children under five years old, but can be extended to other targeted groups in the population (e.g. the elderly) to meet health needs in the wider community. Health visitors seek to educate, in particular by drawing attention to unmet needs in terms of health and social care.

hearing aid a device to improve the hearing. Simple passive devices, such as ear trumpets, are now rarely used. An analogue hearing aid consists of a miniature microphone, an amplifier, and a tiny loudspeaker. The aid is powered by a battery and the whole unit is small enough to fit behind or within the ear inconspicuously. If necessary, aids can be built into the frames of spectacles. In a few cases of conductive hearing loss the loudspeaker is replaced by a vibrator that presses on the bone behind the ear and transmits the sound energy through the bones of the skull to the inner ear. Digital hearing aids are in some respects similar to analogue aids but in addition to the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, they have digital-to-analogue converters and a tiny computer built into the casing of the aid. This enables the aid to be programmed to the patient’s particular requirements and generally offers improved sound quality. See also bone-anchored hearing aid; cochlear implant; environmental hearing aid; implantable hearing aid.

hearing loss see deafness.

hearing therapy the support and rehabilitation of people with hearing difficulties, tinnitus, or vertigo. It includes supplying help with acclimatizing to *hearing aids, teaching lip-reading, advising on *environmental hearing aids, and offering general information and advice regarding the auditory system. Other functions are to explain such conditions as *Ménière’s disease and *otosclerosis and to provide *tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) and other forms of tinnitus management.

heart n. a hollow muscular cone-shaped organ, lying between the lungs, with the pointed end (apex) directed downwards, forwards, and to the left. The heart is about the size of a closed fist. Its wall consists largely of *cardiac muscle (myocardium), lined and surrounded by membranes (see endocardium; pericardium). It is divided by a septum into separate right and left halves, each of which is divided into an upper *atrium and a lower *ventricle (see illustration). Deoxygenated blood from the *venae cavae passes through the right atrium to the right ventricle. This contracts and pumps blood to the lungs via the *pulmonary artery. The newly oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins and passes through to the left ventricle. This forcefully contracts, pumping blood out to the body via the *aorta. The direction of blood flow within the heart is controlled by *valves.

The heart (vertical section).





https://www.bhf.org.uk/

• Website of British Heart Foundation: provides information on the operation of the heart, keeping the heart healthy, and the main types of heart condition

heart age a scoring system that uses biometric data to calculate the risk of a heart attack for an individual and expresses this risk in terms of notional heart age.

heart attack see myocardial infarction.

heart block a condition in which conduction of the electrical impulses generated by the natural pacemaker of the heart (the *sinoatrial node) is impaired. In partial or incomplete heart block conduction between atria and ventricles is delayed (first degree heart block) or not all the impulses are conducted from the atria to the ventricles (second degree heart block). In third degree or complete heart block no impulses are conducted and the ventricles beat at their own slow intrinsic rate (20–40 per minute).

Heart block may be congenital or it may be due to heart disease, including myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and disease of the valves. It is most frequently seen in the elderly as the result of chronic degenerative scarring around the conducting tissue. There may be no symptoms, but when very slow heart and pulse rates occur the patient may develop heart failure or syncope (see Stokes-Adams syndrome). Symptoms may be abolished by the use of an artificial *pacemaker.

heartburn (pyrosis) n. discomfort or pain, usually burning in character, that is felt behind the breastbone and often appears to rise up from the abdomen towards or into the throat. It is usually caused by the reflux of stomach contents into the gullet and may be accompanied by the regurgitation of saliva or gastric fluid into the mouth (waterbrash).

heart failure a condition in which the pumping action of the heart is inadequate due to damaged heart valves, ventricular muscle, or both. This results in back pressure of blood, with congestion of organs. In left ventricular (or left heart) failure, congestion and fluid accumulation affect the lungs, resulting in pulmonary *oedema. The patient suffers breathlessness, cough, and *orthopnoea. There is reduced flow of arterial blood from the heart, which in extreme cases results in peripheral circulatory failure (cardiogenic shock). In right ventricular (or right heart) failure, the veins in the neck become engorged and fluid accumulates in the legs (peripheral oedema) or abdominal cavity (*ascites). If both left and right sides of the heart are affected then a combination of the above features is seen. This is usually referred to as congestive cardiac failure (CCF).

Diuretics (e.g. furosemide) improve symptoms. *ACE inhibitors, *beta blockers, and *spironolactone improve symptoms and life expectancy in patients with left ventricular failure. Heart surgery may be required for the correction of valve problems.

heart-lung machine an apparatus for taking over temporarily the functions of both the heart and the lungs during heart surgery. It incorporates a pump, to maintain the circulation, and equipment to oxygenate the blood. Blood is taken from the body by tubes inserted into the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the oxygenated blood is returned under pressure into a large artery, such as the femoral artery. The surgeon is therefore able to undertake the repair or replacement of heart valves or perform other surgical operations involving the heart and great blood vessels.

heart rate see pulse.

heater-probe n. a device that can be passed through an endoscope to apply controlled heat in order to coagulate a bleeding peptic ulcer.

heat exhaustion fatigue and collapse due to the low blood pressure and blood volume that result from loss of body fluids and salts after prolonged or unaccustomed exposure to heat. It is most common in new arrivals in a hot climate and is treated by giving drinks or intravenous injections of salted water.

heatstroke (sunstroke) n. raised body temperature (pyrexia), absence of sweating, and eventual loss of consciousness due to failure or exhaustion of the temperature-regulating mechanism of the body. It is potentially fatal unless treated immediately: the body should be cooled by applying damp cloths and body fluids restored by giving drinks or intravenous injections of salted water.

heavy-chain disease a disorder associated with proliferation of B lymphocytes producing heavy chains – one of the two types of polypeptide chains (the other being light chains) that make up the structure of immunoglobulins. It results in the production of abnormal immunoglobulins with distorted heavy chains and no light chains.

hebephrenia (disorganized schizophrenia) n. an often chronic form of *schizophrenia that typically starts in adolescence or young adulthood. The most prominent features are disordered thinking, inappropriate affect, flattening or shallowness of affect, naivety and vulnerability, thoughtless cheerfulness, apathy, and aimless or disjointed behaviour. Social and occupational rehabilitation are the most important therapies for most patients; *antipsychotic drugs are also efficacious. —hebephrenic adj.

Heberden’s node a bony thickening arising at the terminal joint of a finger in *osteoarthritis. It is often inherited, with women most commonly affected. [W. Heberden (1710–1801), British physician]

hectic adj. occurring regularly. A hectic fever is a fever that typically develops in the afternoons, in cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.

hecto- prefix denoting a hundred.

HEE see Health Education England.

heel n. the part of the foot that extends behind the ankle joint, formed by the heel bone (see calcaneus).

heel-prick blood test see Guthrie test.

Heerfordt’s syndrome a rare syndrome in which *sarcoidosis is associated with swelling of the parotid and other salivary glands, uveitis, fever, and paralysis of the facial nerve. It can be treated with steroids but generally resolves spontaneously.

HEFNEF heart failure with normal ejection fraction: see diastolic dysfunction.

Hegar’s sign an indication of pregnancy detectable between the 6th and 12th weeks: used before modern urine tests for pregnancy were available. If the fingers of one hand are inserted into the vagina and those of the other are placed over the pelvic cavity, the lower part of the uterus feels very soft compared with the body of the uterus above and the cervix below. [A. Hegar (1830–1914), German gynaecologist]

Heimlich manoeuvre see abdominal thrusts. [H. J. Heimlich (1920–2016), US physician]

helc- (helco-) combining form denoting an ulcer.

Helicobacter n. a genus of spiral flagellated Gram-negative bacteria. The species H. pylori (formerly classified as Campylobacter pylori) is found in the stomach within the mucous layer. It occurs in the majority of middle-aged people and may cause gastritis. It is almost invariably present in duodenal ulceration and usually in gastric ulceration. Testing to confirm infection includes the urea breath test. Eradication of the organism (using various combinations of antibiotics and *antisecretory drugs) promotes ulcer healing. H. pylori has been implicated in some forms of stomach cancer and in coronary heart disease. The role of other Helicobacter species in the causation of disease in humans is unclear.

helicopter-based emergency medical services see HEMS.

helicotrema n. the narrow opening between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani at the tip of the *cochlea in the ear.

helio- combining form denoting the sun.

helix n. the outer curved fleshy ridge of the *pinna of the outer ear.

Heller’s operation see achalasia. [E. Heller (1877–1964), Austrian pathologist]

Heller’s test a test for the presence of protein (albumin) in the urine. A quantity of urine is carefully poured onto the same quantity of pure nitric acid in a test tube. A white ring forms at the junction of the liquids if albumin is present. However, a similar result may be obtained if the urine contains certain drugs or is very concentrated. A dark brown ring indicates the presence of an abnormally high level of potassium indoxyl sulphate in the urine (see indicanuria). [J. F. Heller (1813–71), Austrian pathologist]

HELLP syndrome a form of severe *pre-eclampsia affecting many body systems and characterized by haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count (hence the name). It constitutes an emergency requiring delivery as soon as the patient is stabilized.

Helly’s fluid a mixture of potassium dichromate, sodium sulphate, mercuric chloride, formaldehyde, and distilled water, used in the preservation of bone marrow. [K. Helly (20th century), Swiss pathologist]

hemi- prefix denoting (in medicine) the right or left half of the body. Example: hemianaesthesia (anaesthesia of one side of the body).

hemiachromatopsia n. loss of colour appreciation in one half of the visual field.

hemianopia n. absence of half of the normal field of vision. The commonest type is homonymous hemianopia, in which the same half (right or left) is lost in both eyes. Sometimes the inner halves of the visual field are lost in both eyes, producing a binasal hemianopia, while in others the outer halves are lost, producing a bitemporal hemianopia. Very rarely both upper halves or both lower halves are lost, producing an altitudinal hemianopia.

hemiarthroplasty n. see arthroplasty.

hemiballismus n. see ballism.

hemicolectomy n. surgical removal of sections of the large bowel (*colon), either the ascending colon (right hemicolectomy) or the descending colon (left hemicolectomy). An extended hemicolectomy involves the additional excision of a section of the transverse colon. Such operations are performed in cases of inflammation (e.g. *Crohn’s disease) or cancer. The cut ends of the remaining bowel are joined together in a primary *anastomosis.

hemicrania n. 1. a headache affecting only one side of the head, usually *migraine. 2. absence of half of the skull in a developing fetus.

hemifacial spasm a type of *dystonia that results in irregular spasms affecting the facial muscles on one side. It is usually due to irritation of the facial nerve by an overlying artery within the skull base. Treatment is with injections of *botulinum toxin.

hemihypertrophy n. a condition in which one side of the body is larger than the other. It is often benign but can be associated with *nephroblastoma.

hemispatial neglect (neglect syndrome) a deficit in attention to and awareness of one side of space. It is characterized by inability to process and perceive stimuli on one side of the body or environment that is not due to a lack of sensation. It is generally seen after damage to the right hemisphere, which leads to neglect of the contralateral (left) side of space.

hemisphere n. one of the two halves of the *cerebrum, not in fact hemispherical but more nearly quarter-spherical.

hemizygous adj. describing genes that are carried on an unpaired chromosome, for example the genes on the X chromosome in males. —hemizygote n.

heparin n. an *anticoagulant produced in liver cells, some white blood cells, and certain other sites, which acts by inhibiting the action of the enzyme *thrombin in the final stage of *blood coagulation. An extracted purified form of heparin is widely used for the prevention of blood coagulation both in patients with deep vein thrombosis and similar conditions and in blood collected for examination. The most important side-effect is bleeding. See also low-molecular-weight heparin.

hepat- (hepato-) combining form denoting the liver. Examples: hepatopexy (surgical fixation of); hepatorenal (relating to the liver and kidney).

hepatalgia n. pain in or over the liver. It is usually caused by stretching of the outer covering (capsule) of the liver due to infection (especially liver abscess), an enlarging liver tumour, or swelling (as in cardiac failure or *steatosis).

hepatectomy n. the operation of removing the liver. Partial hepatectomy is the removal of one or more lobes of the liver; it may be carried out following trauma or to remove a localized tumour.

hepatic adj. relating to the liver.

hepatic duct see bile duct.

hepatic encephalopathy (portosystemic encephalopathy) a condition in which brain function is impaired by the presence of toxic substances, absorbed from the colon, which are normally removed or detoxified by the liver. It occurs when the liver is severely damaged (as in cirrhosis) or bypassed. Symptoms include drowsiness, confusion, changes in personality, difficulty in performing tasks (e.g. writing), and coma. Treatment is mainly directed towards the underlying cause of liver disease and to any factors that may have precipitated the clinical deterioration (e.g. recent gastrointestinal haemorrhage, opiate medication, etc). Supportive measures consist of administering bowel cleansers (especially *lactulose, orally or by enema) and reducing protein and/or salt intake.

hepatic flexure the bend in the *colon, just underneath the liver, where the ascending colon joins the transverse colon.

hepaticostomy n. a surgical operation in which a temporary or permanent opening is made into the hepatic duct, the main duct carrying bile from the liver.

hepatic vein one of several short veins originating within the lobes of the liver as small branches, which unite to form the hepatic veins. These lead directly to the inferior vena cava, draining blood from the liver.

hepatitis n. inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, toxic substances (including alcohol), autoimmune disease, metabolic disease, or the excess deposition of fat (see nonalcoholic fatty liver disease). Infectious hepatitis is caused by viruses, several types of which have been isolated. These include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E. Other viral causes of hepatitis include *Epstein-Barr virus, *cytomegalovirus, and rarely *herpes simplex virus. Hepatitis A is transmitted by food or drink contaminated by a carrier or patient and commonly occurs where sanitation is poor. After an incubation period of 15–40 days, the patient develops fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and fever. Yellow discoloration of the skin (see jaundice) appears about a week later and persists for up to three weeks. The patient may be infectious throughout this period. Serious complications are unusual and an attack often confers immunity. Injection of *gammaglobulin provides temporary protection, but active immunization is preferable.

Hepatitis B (formerly known as serum hepatitis) is transmitted by infected blood or blood products contaminating hypodermic needles, blood transfusions, or tattooing needles, by unprotected sexual contact, or (rarely) by contact with any other body fluid. It often occurs in drug users. Symptoms, which develop suddenly after an incubation period of 1–6 months, include headache, fever, chills, general weakness, and jaundice. Treatment includes *interferon alfa and other oral antivirals (e.g. *lamivudine, *adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir). Most patients make a gradual recovery but the mortality rate is 5–20%. A vaccine is available.

Hepatitis C (formerly known as non-A, non-B hepatitis) has a mode of transmission similar to that of hepatitis B (predominantly intravenous drug abuse). Treatment is with interferon alfa, peginterferon alfa, ribavirin, telaprevir, and boceprevir.

Hepatitis D is a defective virus that can only proliferate when there is infection with hepatitis B. Patients with D virus usually have severe chronic hepatitis.

Hepatitis E is transmitted by infected food or drink and can cause acute hepatitis; it is especially severe in a pregnant patient.

Chronic hepatitis continues for months or years, eventually leading to *cirrhosis and possibly to malignancy (see hepatoma). It is usually caused by chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol, or autoimmune disease.

hepatization n. the conversion of lung tissue, which normally holds air, into a solid liver-like mass during the course of acute lobar *pneumonia. In the early stages of lobar pneumonia, the lungs show red hepatization due to the presence of red and white blood cells in the alveolar spaces. As the disease progresses, the red cells are destroyed and phagocytosed, resulting in grey hepatization.

hepato- combining form. see hepat-.

hepatoblastoma n. a malignant tumour of the liver occurring in children, made up of embryonic liver cells. It is often confined to one lobe of the liver; such cases may be treated by a partial *hepatectomy.

hepatocellular adj. relating to or affecting the cells of the liver.

hepatocyte n. the principal cell type in the *liver. It has many functions, including protein synthesis and storage, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, bile production, and detoxification.

hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma) n. the most common primary malignant tumour of the liver. In Western countries patients with chronic hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis are at significantly increased risk of developing hepatoma. The higher incidence of hepatomas in non-Western societies (particularly the Far East and Africa) is partly due to increased hepatitis B endemicity but other factors contribute, including exposure to fungi (see aflatoxin) and other ingested toxins. Hepatomas often synthesize *alpha-fetoprotein, which is a useful serum tumour marker. The treatment options depend on the number and size of hepatomas and the staging of the disease. They include surgical resection, chemotherapy, *chemoembolization, local ablative treatment, and liver transplantation.

hepatomegaly n. enlargement of the liver. This may be due to inflammation, infiltration (e.g. by fat), congestion (due to congestive heart failure), or tumour.

hepatorenal syndrome impairment of renal function, which can occur in acute or chronic liver disease. The condition is associated with intrarenal vasoconstriction and extrarenal vasodilation and hypotension, and the kidney disease is functional rather than structural in nature. There are two common clinical presentations. An acute form (type 1) is characterized by rapid spontaneous deterioration in renal function against a background of acute liver failure, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or acute decompensation of chronic cirrhotic liver disease. A chronic form (type 2) is characterized by insidious onset and slowly progressive deterioration in renal function. This is most often observed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The prognosis of hepatorenal syndrome is extremely poor, and the best hope of survival is usually with liver transplantation.

hepatotoxic adj. damaging or destroying liver cells. Certain drugs, such as *paracetamol, can cause liver damage at high doses or with prolonged use.

hepcidin n. a peptide hormone, secreted by the liver, that regulates the entry of iron into the circulation. It inhibits iron transfer through ferroportin channels (which transport iron from inside to outside the cells), enabling cellular iron storage.

hept- (hepta-) prefix denoting seven.

HER2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2: a protein occurring in excessive amounts on the surface of tumour cells in highly malignant forms of breast cancer. It acts as an *epidermal growth factor receptor, which influences the growth and proliferation of the tumour. See also trastuzumab.

herbal medicine (herbalism) the use of plants or plant extracts for medicinal purposes in order to improve the body’s natural functions and restore balance. Herbal medicines are given in many forms (liquids, infusions, tablets, topical preparations, etc.) and form part of an increasing number of complementary medical therapies. See phytotherapy.

Herceptin n. see trastuzumab.

hereditary adj. transmitted from parents to their offspring; inherited.

hereditary multiple exostoses see exostosis.

hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome) an inherited disorder in which there is an increased incidence of colorectal *polyp formation, although to a lesser extent than in familial adenomatous *polyposis (FAP). HNPCC has also been associated with other types of tumour, particularly ovarian and endometrial tumours. This increased risk is due to inherited mutations that impair DNA mismatch repair.

hereditary periodic fever syndromes a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and inflammation in the absence of infection. They include familial Mediterranean fever (see polyserositis), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). Causative gene mutations have been identified.

hermaphrodite n. a former term for an individual having both male and female sex organs or sex organs containing both ovarian and testicular cells. It is now considered offensive. See intersex.

hermeneutics n. the practice of interpreting literary and historical texts in relation to one another and to their various contexts. By extension, in *clinical ethics, interpreting the ‘text’ of an ill patient in terms of history taking, physical examination, diagnostic tests, and listening to the patient’s account of their own experience.

hernia n. the protrusion of an organ or tissue out of the body cavity in which it normally lies. An inguinal hernia (or rupture) occurs in the lower abdomen; a sac of peritoneum, containing fat or part of the bowel, bulges through a weak part (inguinal canal) of the abdominal wall. It may result from physical straining or coughing. A scrotal hernia is an inguinal hernia so large that it passes into the scrotum; a femoral hernia is similar to an inguinal hernia but protrudes at the top of the thigh, through the point at which the femoral artery passes from the abdomen to the thigh. Other hernias of the abdominal wall include periumbilical, epigastric, and postsurgical hernias. A diaphragmatic hernia is the protrusion of an abdominal organ through the diaphragm into the chest cavity; the most common type is the hiatus hernia, in which the stomach passes partly or completely into the chest cavity through the opening (hiatus) for the oesophagus. This may be associated with *gastro-oesophageal reflux, although most patients have no symptoms.

Hernias may be complicated by becoming impossible to return to their normal site (irreducible); swollen and fixed within their sac (incarcerated); or cut off from their blood supply, becoming painful and eventually gangrenous (strangulated). The best treatment for hernias, especially if they are painful, is surgical repair (see hernioplasty).

hernia-en-glissade an inguinal *hernia that has an element of descent (‘slide’) of related structures alongside the sac.

hernio- combining form denoting a hernia.

hernioplasty n. the surgical operation to repair a hernia, in which the sac is excised (*herniotomy), the abnormal opening is sewn up, and the weakness strengthened, most commonly using a mesh of polypropylene.

herniorrhaphy n. surgical repair of a hernia. It can be performed through a *laparoscope. See also hernioplasty; herniotomy.

herniotomy n. excision of a hernial sac: the first stage of the surgical repair of a hernia. In infants and young muscular subjects it is all that is needed to cure the hernia.

heroic measures a mainly US term for therapies instituted to save a patient’s life when all other options have failed. These may have serious or even fatal side-effects, but the risk is considered worth taking since the patient will surely otherwise die. Many people specify ‘no heroic measures’ in their *advance directive (‘living will’).

heroin n. a white crystalline powder derived from *morphine that is a highly addictive drug of abuse. See also diamorphine.

heroin-associated nephropathy see HAN.

herpangina n. an acute viral infection, occurring predominantly in children, that causes a fever of sudden onset associated with malaise and acute ulceration of the soft palate and tonsillar area. It usually lasts 2–5 days.

herpes n. inflammation of the skin or mucous membranes that is caused by *herpesviruses and characterized by collections of small blisters. There are two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV): type I causes the common cold sore, usually present on or around the lips; type II is mainly associated with genital herpes and is sexually transmitted. However, types I and II can both cause either genital herpes or cold sores, depending on the site of initial infection. HSV blisters are contagious through skin-to-skin contact and are recurrent in some people. HSV can also affect the conjunctiva (see also dendritic ulcer).

Herpes zoster (shingles) is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. Following an attack of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. Later, under one of a number of influences, the virus migrates down the sensory nerve to affect one or more *dermatomes on the skin in a band, causing the characteristic shingles rash. One side of the face or an eye (ophthalmic zoster) may be involved. Shingles may be chronically painful (post-herpetic neuralgia), especially in the elderly. See also Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

Treatment of all forms of herpes is with an appropriate preparation of *aciclovir or related antiviral drugs; shingles may require potent analgesics and treatment of secondary bacterial infection.

herpesvirus n. one of a group of DNA-containing viruses causing latent infections in animals (including humans). The herpesviruses are the causative agents of *herpes and chickenpox. The group also includes the *cytomegalovirus and *Epstein–Barr virus. Herpesvirus simiae (virus B) causes an infection in monkeys similar to herpes simplex, but when transmitted to humans it can produce fatal encephalitis.

hertz n. the *SI unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second. Symbol: Hz.

Herxheimer reaction see Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

heterochromia n. colour difference in the iris of the eye, which is usually congenital but is occasionally secondary to inflammation of the iris (as in *Fuchs’ heterochromic cyclitis). In heterochromia iridis one iris differs in colour from the other; in heterochromia iridum one part of the iris differs in colour from the rest. —heterochromic adj.

heterogametic adj. describing the sex that produces two different kinds of gamete, which carry different *sex chromosomes, and that therefore determines the sex of the offspring. In humans men are the heterogametic sex: the sperm cells carry either an X or a Y chromosome. Compare homogametic.

heterogeneity n. (in oncology) variability or differences in the properties of cells within a tumour.

heterograft n. see xenograft.

heterophoria n. a tendency to squint. Normally both the eyes work together and look at the same point simultaneously, but if one eye is covered it will move out of alignment with the object the other eye is still viewing. When the cover is removed the eye immediately returns to its normal position. Most people have a small degree of heterophoria in which the covered eye turns outwards, away from the nose (exophoria; compare esophoria). Heterophoria may produce eyestrain because of the unconscious effort required to keep the two eyes aligned. See also strabismus.

Heterophyes n. a genus of small parasitic *flukes occurring in Egypt and the Far East. Adult flukes of the species H. heterophyes live in the small intestine of humans and other fish-eating animals; in humans the flukes can produce serious symptoms (see heterophyiasis). The fluke has two intermediate hosts, a snail and a mullet fish.

heterophyiasis n. an infestation of the small intestine with the parasitic fluke *Heterophyes heterophyes. Humans become infected on eating raw or salted fish that contains the larval stage of the fluke. The presence of adult flukes may provoke symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhoea; if the eggs reach the brain, spinal cord, and heart (via the bloodstream) they produce serious lesions. Tetrachloroethylene may be used in treatment of the infection.

heteropsia n. different vision in each eye.

heterosis n. hybrid vigour: the increased sturdiness, resistance to disease, etc., of animals whose parents are genetically different compared both with their parents and with the offspring of genetically similar parents.

Hib vaccine a vaccine that gives protection against the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Before the introduction of the vaccine in the UK in 1992, Hib was the commonest cause of meningitis in children under the age of 2 years. The vaccine, which has an excellent safety record, is currently given with the primary vaccines at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and as a booster at 12 months of age to extend protection against Hib meningitis. See immunization.

hiccup n. abrupt involuntary lowering of the diaphragm and closure of the sound-producing folds at the upper end of the trachea, producing a characteristic sound as the breath is drawn in. Hiccups, which usually occur repeatedly, may be caused by indigestion or more serious disorders, such as alcoholism. Medical name: singultus.

Hickman catheter a fine plastic cannula usually inserted into the subclavian vein in the neck to allow administration of drugs and repeated blood samples. The catheter is tunnelled for several centimetres beneath the skin to prevent infection entering the bloodstream. It is used most frequently in patients receiving long-term chemotherapy, particularly infusion regimes (e.g. fluorouracil).

hidr- (hidro-) combining form denoting sweat. Example: hidropoiesis (formation of).

hidradenitis suppurativa an unpleasant condition characterized by deep abscesses in the armpits, groin, and anogenital regions leading to sinuses and bridge scarring. It is regarded as part of the *follicular occlusion tetrad. It is three times more common in women and may be under androgen control. Treatment is by weight loss, smoking cessation, long-term antibiotics, anti-androgens, or occasionally surgery. The condition is difficult to treat but often resolves spontaneously after many years.

hidrotic n. an agent that causes sweating. *Parasympathomimetic drugs are hidrotics.

HIE see hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.

HIFU high-intensity focused *ultrasound: a minimally invasive technique used for the treatment of primary localized prostate cancer and prostate cancer that has recurred after radiotherapy. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum and precisely focuses a beam of high-intensity ultrasound on the cancerous tissue resulting in coagulative necrosis by raising the temperature of the target tissue to approximately 90°C. The procedure may have fewer side-effects than other treatments for localized prostate cancer.

high-density lipoprotein (HDL) the smallest and densest of the *lipoproteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides around the body, which is derived mainly from precursors produced in the liver. HDL has an important role in reverse cholesterol transfer, i.e. the removal of cholesterol from the circulation and the blood vessel walls and its transfer to the liver. Higher levels of HDL have been shown to be associated with lower levels of cardiovascular disease.

high-dependency unit (HDU) a hospital unit that provides specialist nursing care to seriously ill patients. The level of care given is greater than that available on general wards but less than in *intensive therapy units.

high-intensity focused ultrasound see HIFU; ultrasound.

hilar cell tumour an androgen-producing tumour of the ovary found in older women and often resulting in *virilization.

hip bone (innominate bone) a bone formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis. It articulates with the femur by the acetabulum of the ilium, a deep socket into which the head of the femur fits (see hip joint). Between the pubis and ischium, below and slightly in front of the acetabulum, is a large opening – the obturator foramen. The right and left hip bones form part of the *pelvis.

hip girdle see pelvic girdle.

hip joint the ball-and-socket joint (see enarthrosis) between the head of the femur and the acetabulum (socket) of the ilium (see hip bone). It is a common site of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, which is often treated surgically (by *hip replacement). See also congenital dislocation of the hip.

hippocampus n. a swelling in the floor of the lateral *ventricle of the brain. It contains complex foldings of cortical tissue and is involved, with other connections of the *hippocampal formation, in the workings of the *limbic system. —hippocampal adj.

Hippocratic oath an oath that is often assumed to be taken but is actually rarely sworn by doctors. It is a code of behaviour and practice commonly attributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460–370 bc), known as the ‘Father of Medicine’, and taken by the students of the medical school in Cos where he taught, but both the authorship and application of the oath to Hippocrates’ students has been disputed. The ideas promulgated by the original oath are now seriously out of date (for instance there is no discussion of *truth-telling), and some medical schools have created modern alternatives for their own use. See also beneficence; medical ethics.

Hippuran n. trade name for sodium iodohippurate, used as a contrast medium in radiology of the urinary tract. Labelled with iodine-131, it can be used to measure renal function, although it has now largely been replaced by other agents.

hippus n. abnormal rhythmical variations in the size of the pupils, independent of the intensity of the light falling on the eyes. It is occasionally seen in various diseases of the nervous system.

hip replacement a surgical procedure developed for replacing a diseased hip joint with a prosthesis. A plastic or metal cup forms the socket, and the head of the femur is replaced by a metal ball on a stem placed inside the femur. There are many types of prosthesis, which can be fixed to the bone with or without cement. See also arthroplasty.

Hirschsprung’s disease a congenital condition in which the rectum and sometimes part of the lower colon have failed to develop a normal nerve network. The affected portion does not expand or conduct the contents of the bowel, which accumulate in and distend the colon. Symptoms, which are usually apparent in the first weeks of life, are vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension, and intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is by rectal biopsy (to confirm the absence of nerve cells), anorectal *manometry, and imaging. Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected segment and anastomosis of the remaining healthy bowel to the anus. See also megacolon. [H. Hirschsprung (1830–1916), Danish physician]

histamine n. a compound derived from the amino acid histidine. It is found in nearly all tissues of the body, associated mainly with the *mast cells. Histamine has pronounced pharmacological activity, causing dilation of blood vessels and contraction of smooth muscle (for example, in the lungs). It is an important mediator of inflammation and is released in large amounts after skin damage (such as that due to animal venoms and toxins), producing a characteristic skin reaction (consisting of flushing, a flare, and a weal). Histamine is also released in anaphylactic reactions and allergic conditions, including asthma, and gives rise to some of the symptoms of these conditions. See also anaphylaxis; antihistamine.

histamine acid phosphate a derivative of *histamine that was formerly used to test for acid secretion in the stomach in conditions involving abnormal gastric acid secretion, such as *Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

histoplasmosis n. an infection caused by inhaling spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The primary pulmonary form usually produces no symptoms or harmful effects and is recognized retrospectively by X-rays and positive *histoplasmin skin testing. Occasionally, progressive histoplasmosis, which resembles tuberculosis, develops. The fungus may spread via the bloodstream to attack other organs, such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, or intestine. Symptomatic disease is treated with intravenous amphotericin. The spores are found in soil contaminated by faeces, especially from chickens and bats. The disease is endemic in the northern and central USA, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and parts of Africa.

histotoxic adj. poisonous to tissues: applied to certain substances and conditions.

histrionic personality disorder a type of *personality disorder characterized by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking, self-dramatization, inappropriately seductive behaviour, and an excessive need for approval. It affects more women than men. Classified as a specific personality disorder in DSM-IV-TR, in DSM-5 it is treated as a subtype of *narcissistic personality disorder.

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) a *retrovirus responsible for *AIDS. There are two varieties, HIV-1 and HIV-2; the latter is most common in Africa. See also HTLV.

HIVAN human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy: a condition associated with HIV infection. The patient usually presents with nephrotic-range proteinuria (see nephrotic syndrome) with microscopic haematuria, without oedema but with a rapid decline in renal function. Enlargement of the kidneys on ultrasound examination is a common finding, and HIVAN may precede other manifestations of HIV infection. Typical renal pathological findings are of a collapsing form of *focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The clinical course is usually one of rapid decline in renal function.

hives n. see urticaria.

HLA system human leucocyte antigen system: a series of four gene families (termed A, B, C, and D) that code for polymorphic proteins expressed on the surface of most nucleated cells. Individuals inherit from each parent one gene (or set of genes) for each subdivision of the HLA system. If two individuals have identical HLA types, they are said to be histocompatible. Successful tissue transplantation requires a minimum number of HLA differences between donor and recipient tissues.

HMG CoA reductase hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: the key rate-limiting enzyme that is involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. Inhibition of its action is the mechanism by which the *statin group of lipid-lowering agents work.

HNA see health needs assessment.

HNPCC see hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.

hoarding disorder a condition in which a person struggles to discard useless or worn-out possessions, acquires an excessive number of such items, and stores them in a chaotic manner resulting in unmanageable clutter. The items are nearly always of little or no monetary value, although valuable items are often found mixed indiscriminately with the rest. Hoarding disorder was included in DSM-5 in 2013 as a new disorder and has been considered for introduction in ICD-11.

hobnail liver the liver of a patient with *cirrhosis, which has a knobbly appearance caused by regenerating nodules separated by bands of fibrous tissue.

Hodgkin’s disease a malignant disease of lymphatic tissue – a form of *lymphoma – usually characterized by painless enlargement of one or more groups of lymph nodes in the neck, axillae (armpits), groin, chest, or abdomen; the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and bones may also be involved. Apart from the enlarging nodes, there may also be weight loss, fever, profuse sweating at night, and itching (known as B symptoms). Hodgkin’s disease is distinguished from other forms of lymphoma by the presence of large binucleate cells (Reed–Sternberg cells) in the affected lymph nodes. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and may include surgery, radiotherapy, drug therapy, or a combination of these. Drugs used in the treatment of the disease include vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone, chlorambucil, and vinblastine. Many patients can be cured; in the early stages of the disease this may be in the order of 90% or more. [T. Hodgkin (1798–1866), British physician]

home delivery see community midwife.

home help see care assistant.

homeo- (homoeo-) combining form denoting similar; like.

homeopathy (homoeopathy) n. a complementary therapy based on the theory that ‘like cures like’. It involves a belief that conditions may be treated with a tiny dose of a substance, so diluted as to be indistinguishable from pure water, that in larger doses would normally cause or aggravate that condition. A second principle is a process of dilution and shaking known as ‘succussion’. Homeopathy was developed by a German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann (1755–1843), in 1796. It was described as ‘scientifically implausible’ by the UK’s Chief Medical Officer in 2010 and is not recommended by NICE. —homeopathic adj. —homeopathist n.

homeostasis n. the physiological process by which the internal systems of the body (e.g. blood pressure, body temperature, *acid-base balance) are maintained at equilibrium, despite variations in the external conditions. —homeostatic adj.

home visit see domiciliary consultation.

homo- combining form denoting the same or common.

homocysteine n. a sulphur-containing amino acid that is an intermediate in the synthesis of *cysteine. A deficiency in the enzyme cystathionine synthetase results in elevated levels in the blood of homocysteine and homocystine (an oxidized form of homocysteine), resulting in elevated urinary levels (see homocystinuria). It is becoming increasingly recognized that elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood are a risk factor for vascular disease independent of diabetes, hypertension, elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood, and smoking. Levels are also elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency.

homocystinuria n. an *inborn error of metabolism, inherited as an autosomal *recessive trait, caused by an enzyme deficiency resulting in an excess of *homocysteine in the blood and the presence of homocystine in the urine. Clinically affected individuals have learning disabilities, are excessively tall with long fingers (due to overgrowth of bones), generally have loose ligaments (which may result in dislocation of the lens), and have a tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries, leading to strokes. Treatment is by diet, which may allow for normal development if the disease is recognized early enough, and high-dose vitamin B6 therapy.

homoeopathy n. see homeopathy.

homogametic adj. describing the sex that produces only one kind of gamete, which carries the same *sex chromosome, and that therefore does not determine the sex of the offspring. In humans women are the homogametic sex: each egg cell carries an X chromosome. Compare heterogametic.

homogenize vb. to reduce material to a uniform consistency, e.g. by crushing and mixing. Organs and tissues are homogenized to determine their overall content of a particular enzyme or other substance. —homogenization n.

homogentisic acid a product formed during the metabolism of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. In normal individuals homogentisic acid is oxidized by the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase. In rare cases this enzyme is lacking and a condition known as *alcaptonuria, in which large amounts of homogentisic acid are excreted in the urine, results.

homograft n. see allograft.

homoiothermic adj. warm-blooded: able to maintain a constant body temperature independently of, and despite variations in, the temperature of the surroundings. Mammals (including humans) and birds are homoiothermic. Compare poikilothermic. —homoiothermy n.

homolateral adj. see ipsilateral.

homologous adj. 1. (in anatomy) describing organs or parts that have the same basic structure and evolutionary origin, but not necessarily the same function or superficial structure. Compare analogous. 2. (in genetics) describing a pair of chromosomes of similar shape and size and having identical gene loci. One member of the pair is derived from the mother; the other from the father.

homonymous adj. describing a visual defect in which the visual field to one side of the body is restricted in both eyes (see hemianopia).

homozygous adj. describing an individual in whom the members of a pair of genes determining a particular characteristic are identical. See allele. Compare heterozygous. —homozygote n.

homunculus n. 1. (manikin) a dwarf with no deformity or abnormality other than small size. 2. (manikin) a small jointed anatomical model of a man. 3. (in early biological theory) a miniature human being thought to be contained within each of the reproductive cells.

honeycomb lung the honeycomb pattern seen on X-ray at the later stages of chronic lung conditions, in which the lungs become less elastic and more fibrotic. Once the honeycomb appearance is visible on the X-ray, the lungs are likely to progress to respiratory failure.

HONK see hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state.

hook n. a surgical instrument with a bent or curved tip, used to hold, lift, or retract tissue at operation.

hookworm n. either of two nematode worms, *Necator americanus or *Ancylostoma duodenale, which live as parasites in the human intestine. Both species, also known as the New and Old World hookworms respectively, are of great medical importance (see hookworm disease).

hookworm disease a condition resulting from an infestation of the small intestine by hookworms. Hookworm larvae live in the soil and infect humans by penetrating the skin. The worms travel to the lungs in the bloodstream and from there pass via the windpipe and gullet to the small intestine. Heavy hookworm infections may cause considerable damage to the wall of the intestine, leading to a serious loss of blood; this, in conjunction with malnutrition, can provoke severe anaemia. Symptoms include itching and rash at the site of infection, followed by abdominal pain, diarrhoea, debility, and mental inertia. More serious effects can include difficulty in breathing, heart enlargement, and irregular heartbeat. The disease occurs mostly in the tropics and subtropics; mebendazole is used in treatment.

hordeolum n. see stye.

horizontal transmission the spread of an infectious agent from one person or group to another, usually through contact with contaminated material, such as sputum or faeces. Compare vertical transmission.

hormone n. a substance that is produced in one part of the body (by an *endocrine gland, such as the thyroid, adrenal, or pituitary), passes into the bloodstream and is carried to other (distant) organs or tissues, where it acts to modify their structure or function. Examples of hormones are corticosteroids (from the adrenal cortex), adrenaline (from the adrenal medulla), androgens and oestrogens (from the testis and ovary, respectively), thyroid hormone (from the thyroid gland), and insulin (from the islets of Langerhans). The *pituitary gland secretes a variety of hormones, whose release is controlled by specific releasing hormones.

hormone-binding globulins a family of plasma proteins whose function is to bind free hormone molecules to varying degrees and thus reduce their function. Alterations in levels of the binding globulins, for example during pregnancy or ill health, can result in variations in assays of hormone levels in individuals. Examples include thyroid-binding globulin, sex-hormone-binding globulin, and corticosteroid-binding globulin.

hormone replacement therapy (HRT) the use of female hormones for the relief of symptoms resulting from cessation of ovarian function, either at the time of the natural *menopause or following surgical removal of the ovaries. Oestrogenic hormones may be prescribed orally, transdermally (as skin patches or gel), or by subcutaneous implant. The combination of progestogen with oestrogen is preferred if the woman has retained her uterus, since administration of oestrogen alone might cause overstimulation of the endometrium or even cancer. HRT is effective against *vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) and genitourinary atrophy (causing vaginal dryness); for the best results it should be started as soon as the symptoms first appear. Because studies indicate that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and other conditions associated with ageing, it should be used only in the short term (no more than five years) in women over 50 and is no longer recommended for the prevention of osteoporosis.

horn n. (in anatomy) a process, outgrowth, or extension of an organ or other structure. It is often paired. In the spinal cord crescent-shaped areas of grey matter (seen in cross section) are known as the dorsal and ventral horns.

Horner’s syndrome a syndrome consisting of a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid (*ptosis), and an absence of sweating over the affected side of the face. The symptoms are due to a disorder of the sympathetic nerves in the brainstem or cervical (neck) region. [J. F. Horner (1831–86), Swiss ophthalmologist]

horseshoe kidney an anatomical variation in kidney development whereby the lower poles of both kidneys are joined together. This usually causes no trouble but it may be associated with impaired drainage of urine from the kidney by the ureters, which cross in front of the united lower segment. The condition is associated with *Turner’s syndrome, and there is a small increase in the incidence of *nephroblastoma in those with horseshoe kidney.

hospice n. an institution that provides palliative or end-of-life care for people with terminal illnesses. Most modern hospices are modelled on St Christopher’s Hospice, founded in London in 1967 by Dame Cicely Saunders. They specialize in symptom management and often also provide spiritual and psychological help. Support for the families of the patients is also a feature of the services provided by most hospices. Hospice at Home services provide specialist palliative care for terminally ill patients in their own homes. See also dying; palliative.

hospital n. an institution providing medical or psychiatric care and treatment of patients. Such care may be residential (in-patient), including the care of patients for a whole day and their return home at night (day care). Out-patient services include consultation with specialists by prior appointment, X-rays, laboratory tests, physiotherapy, and accident and emergency services for those requiring urgent care. Most health districts have a district general hospital (DGH), which provides sufficient basic services for the population of the district. Some larger hospitals have resources that are more highly specialized, to meet the needs of a wider population, providing so-called regional or supraregional (national) services. Such hospitals often provide training for medical students (teaching or university hospitals) and for postgraduate education. Some smaller hospitals – known as community hospitals – may be staffed by general practitioners and are intended for people for whom home care is not practicable on social grounds. Within the NHS, individual hospitals or groups of hospitals are generally part of *foundation trusts, deriving their income largely from contracts with *clinical commissioning groups. There are also around 400 private hospitals in the UK, which operate outside of the NHS, though some are contracted to provide some NHS services.

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) (in England) a database containing data on all admissions to NHS hospitals and admissions of NHS patients treated elsewhere. See record linkage.

hospital fatality rate see case fatality rate.

hospital infection see nosocomial infection.

hospital social worker a social worker employed to assist hospital patients with social problems that may arise through illness. See also social services.

host n. an animal or plant in or upon which a *parasite lives. An intermediate host is one in which the parasite passes its larval or asexual stages; a definitive host is one in which the parasite develops to its sexual stage.

Hounsfield unit the numerical unit assigned electronically to each *pixel in a computerized tomography (CT) image, according to its X-ray density. The fixed points on the scale are arbitrarily assigned as −1000 for air and 0 for water. The CT image is viewed in a ‘window’. The range of Hounsfield units displayed (window width) and the centre point of the range of interest (window level) can be varied by the radiologist in order to observe specific tissues (see windowing). The unit was named after Sir Godfrey Hounsfield (1919–2004), who developed CT scanning in the 1950s. Symbol: HU.

hourglass stomach a deformity of the stomach in which the ‘waist’ is constricted by fibrosis caused by a chronic peptic ulcer, producing an upper and a lower cavity separated by a narrow channel.

House–Brackmann facial nerve grading system (House–Brackmann score, House–Brackmann scale, House–Brackmann facial weakness scale) a six-point grading system for patients with *Bell’s palsy or other forms of facial nerve palsy. Grade I is normal function; grade VI is a total palsy. [J. W. House and D. E. Brackmann (21st century), US otorhinolarygologists]

house-dust mite see Dermatophagoides.

housemaid’s knee (prepatellar bursitis) inflammation and resultant swelling of the bursa in front of the kneecap, usually due to repetitive friction and pressure over the kneecap, as from frequent episodes of prolonged kneeling. Treatment includes pressure bandaging, *NSAIDs, and avoidance of kneeling. See bursitis.

HPV see human papillomavirus.

HRT see hormone replacement therapy.

HSE see Health and Safety Executive.

5HT 5-hydroxytryptamine (see serotonin).

5HT1 agonist (triptan) any one of a class of drugs that stimulate *serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors and are effective in the relief of *migraine headaches by causing constriction of cerebral blood vessels. The group includes almotriptan, naratriptan, *sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan.

HTLV human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (or lymphocytotrophic virus) – a family of viruses that includes HTLV-I, which causes lymphoma. *HIV (the AIDS virus) was formerly called HTLV-III.

HU see Hounsfield unit.

Hudson–Stähli line a linear horizontal yellowish line seen in the deep epithelium of ageing corneas. [A. C. Hudson (1875–1962), British ophthalmologist; J. Stähli (20th century), Swiss ophthalmologist]

Hughes syndrome see antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. [G. Hughes (21st century), British physician]

human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) a hormone, similar to the pituitary *gonadotrophins, that is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. hCG maintains the secretion of *progesterone by the corpus luteum of the ovary, the secretion of pituitary gonadotrophins being blocked during pregnancy. Large amounts are excreted in the urine, and this is used as the basis for most *pregnancy tests. Serum hCG monitoring is used for tracking early pregnancy and detecting *ectopic pregnancies (in which the level will not double over a 48-hour period, as it does with normal pregnancies). The level of hCG in the serum is also one of the indicators used in *prenatal screening tests: levels are higher in pregnancies affected by Down’s syndrome in comparison with normal pregnancies (see also papp-a; triple test). Levels of hCG are very high in *gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Some malignant tumours (e.g. malignant teratoma, choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumour) secrete hCG, which can be used as a *tumour marker. A preparation of hCG is given by injection to treat fertility problems due to ovulation disorders and to induce *superovulation in in vitro fertilization.

human chorionic somatomammotrophin see human placental lactogen.

Human Fertilisation and Embryology Acts Acts of the UK parliament in 1990 and 2008, establishing and amending principles for the legal supervision, by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, of the creation, use, and storage of human embryos outside the body and of their use in treatment and research. The 2008 amendments included a ban on sex selection for social reasons, recognition of same-sex couples as potential legal parents, and regulations related to developing areas of research using embryos. The 1990 Act had also reduced the legal time limit for most abortions from 28 weeks gestation (as in the 1967 Abortion Act) to 24 weeks. Interpretation and regulation of principles and practice in this rapidly developing area of research and practice continue and are often controversial.

Human Genome Project a massive international research project to isolate all the genes in human DNA and determine the sequence of genes on human chromosomes. The project began in 1988 and the full draft sequence was published in 2001; the high-quality sequence was completed in 2003. The human genome comprises some 3 × 109 nucleotide base pairs (see DNA) forming 22,000–25,000 genes, distributed among 23 pairs of chromosomes. Knowledge of the entire human genome has already resulted in the identification of the genes associated with many hereditary disorders and revealed the existence of a genetic basis or component for many other diseases not previously known to have one. Theoretically, this would enable the development of targeted drugs and the large-scale genetic screening of populations. See pharmacogenomics; targeted agent.

human immunodeficiency virus see HIV.

humanity n. 1. the state or quality of being human. In most ethical traditions, membership of the human species is seen as conferring a unique moral status, so that human life is considered inherently and particularly valuable and worthy of protection (see sanctity of life). Humanity may be defined in terms of a unique capacity to feel, reason, evoke emotional responses, or form relationships (see personhood). 2. compassion or benevolence.

human leucocyte antigen system see HLA system.

human menopausal gonadotrophins commercially available preparations of *follicle-stimulating hormone and *luteinizing hormone. They are used mainly to treat infertility in women with gonadotrophin deficiency due to hypopituitarism and to stimulate superovulation in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.

human papillomavirus (HPV) a virus – a member of the *papovavirus group – that causes warts, including genital warts. There are over 100 strains of HPV: certain strains are considered to be causative factors in the development of anal and genital cancers, especially cervical cancer, but additional factors are necessary before the cells become malignant. HPV has also been implicated in oral dysplasia and some squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. In women the presence of HPV may be detected on colposcopic examination, although techniques using DNA amplification (see polymerase chain reaction) give more accurate results and suggest that up to 40% of a normal, apparently healthy, female population may harbour these viruses. In women with an abnormal cervical smear, the DNA test is found to be positive in a much higher percentage and is therefore a useful indicator of a high risk of developing cancer of the cervix. The HPV vaccine provides protection against strains of HPV associated with cervical cancer and other precancerous conditions (Ceravix, Gardasil) and against genital warts (Gardasil).

human placental lactogen (human chorionic somatomammotrophin) a protein hormone of 190 amino acids produced by the placenta during most but not all pregnancies. Despite its name it does not appear to have a role in lactation and its exact function remains obscure. It does, however, seem to contribute to the development of diabetes in some pregnancies.

human rights a legal framework adopted by the United Nations following World War II that sought to define and promote fundamental entitlements, conditions, and freedoms to be afforded to all human beings. In the UK the Human Rights Act 1998 enacts the provisions of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, which sets out, via fourteen articles, an individual’s rights, entitlements, and freedoms.

Human Tissue Authority the UK government agency, established by the Human Tissue Act 2004, that regulates the removal, use, and storage of human organs and tissue from both the living and the deceased for certain purposes as defined by the statute. These purposes include clinical research, clinical audit, and medical education. Anyone handling such material for those purposes should have a licence issued by the authority. Membership of the authority comprises clinical, scientific, academic, and lay representatives.

humectant 1. n. a substance that is used for moistening. 2. adj. causing moistening.

humerus n. the bone of the upper arm (see illustration). The head of the humerus articulates with the *scapula at the shoulder joint. At the lower end of the shaft the trochlea articulates with the *ulna and part of the radius. The radius also articulates with a rounded protuberance (the capitulum) close to the trochlea. Depressions (fossae) at the front and back of the humerus accommodate the ulna and radius, respectively, when the arm is flexed or straightened.

The humerus (posterior surface).





humoral adj. circulating in the bloodstream; humoral *immunity requires circulating antibodies.

humour n. a body fluid. See aqueous humour; vitreous humour.

hunchback deformity see kyphos.

Hunner’s ulcer see interstitial cystitis. [G. L. Hunner (1868–1957), US urologist]

Hunter’s syndrome a hereditary disorder caused by deficiency of an enzyme that results in the accumulation of protein–carbohydrate complexes and fats in the cells of the body (see mucopolysaccharidosis). This leads to learning disability, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and prominent coarse facial features (gargoylism). The disease is *sex-linked, being restricted to males, although females can be *carriers. Medical name: mucopolysaccharidosis type II. [C. H. Hunter (1872–1955), US physician]

Huntington’s disease (Huntington’s chorea) a hereditary disease caused by a defect in a single gene that is inherited as an autosomal *dominant characteristic, therefore tending to appear in half of the children of the parents with this condition. Symptoms, which begin to appear in early middle age, include unsteady gait and jerky involuntary movements (see chorea), accompanied later by behavioural changes, and progressive dementia. There is a defect in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4; *genetic screening is possible for those at risk. [G. Huntington (1850–1916), US physician]

Hurler’s syndrome a hereditary disorder caused by deficiency of an enzyme that results in the accumulation of protein–carbohydrate complexes and fats in the cells of the body (see mucopolysaccharidosis). This leads to severe learning disabilities, enlargement of the liver and spleen, heart defects, deformities of the bones, and coarsening and thickening of facial features (gargoylism). A bone marrow transplant offers the only hope of treatment. Medical name: mucopolysaccharidosis type I. [G. Hurler (1889–1965), Austrian paediatrician]

Hürthle cell tumour a malignant tumour of the thyroid gland that arises from Hürthle (or Askanazy) cells, altered follicular cells of the gland that have large nuclei and stain deeply with eosin (these cells are also found in benign nodules and Hashimoto’s disease). Hürthle cell carcinoma is not as common as papillary, follicular, or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (see thyroid cancer). [K. W. Hürthle (1860–1945), German histologist]

Hutchinson’s teeth narrowed and notched permanent incisor teeth: a sign of congenital *syphilis. [J. Hutchinson (1828–1913), British surgeon]

hyal- (hyalo-) combining form denoting 1. glassy; transparent. 2. hyalin. 3. the vitreous humour of the eye.

hyalin n. a clear glassy material produced as the result of degeneration in certain tissues, particularly connective tissue and epithelial cells.

hyaline cartilage the most common type of *cartilage: a bluish-white elastic material with a matrix of chondroitin sulphate in which fine collagen fibrils are embedded.

hyaline membrane disease see respiratory distress syndrome.

hyalitis n. inflammation of the *vitreous humour of the eye. See also asteroid hyalosis.

hyaloid artery a fetal artery lying in the *hyaloid canal of the eye and supplying the lens.

hyaloid canal a channel within the vitreous humour of the *eye. It extends from the centre of the optic disc, where it communicates with the lymph spaces of the optic nerve, to the posterior wall of the lens.

hyaloid membrane the transparent membrane that surrounds the *vitreous humour of the eye, separating it from the retina.

hyaluronic acid an acid *mucopolysaccharide that acts as the binding and protective agent of the ground substance of connective tissue. It is also present in the synovial fluid around joints and in the vitreous and aqueous humours of the eye.

hyaluronidase n. an enzyme that depolymerizes *hyaluronic acid and therefore increases the permeability of connective tissue. Hyaluronidase is found in the testes, in semen, and in other tissues.

hybrid n. the offspring of a cross between two genetically unlike individuals. A hybrid, whose parents are usually of different species or varieties, is often sterile.

hybridomas pl. n. cells created by fusion of activated lymphocytes with malignant cells. The resulting hybrid cells are cloned and produce antibodies or T-cell receptors, identical to those produced by the parent immune cells. See monoclonal antibody.

HYCOSY (hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography) an out-patient technique that tests for blocked Fallopian tubes. Using *transvaginal ultrasonography following the injection of an echo contrast medium through the cervix, flow along the tubes can be reliably visualized. See also Doppler ultrasound.

hydatid n. a bladder-like cyst formed in various human tissues following the growth of the larval stage of an *Echinococcus tapeworm. E. granulosus produces a single large fluid-filled cyst, called unilocular hydatid, which gives rise internally to smaller daughter cysts. The entire hydatid is bound by a fibrous capsule. E. multilocularis forms aggregates of many smaller cysts with a jelly-like matrix, called an alveolar hydatid, and enlarges by budding off external daughter cysts. Alveolar hydatids are not delimited by fibrous capsules and produce malignant tumours, which invade and destroy human tissues. See also hydatid disease.

hydatid disease (hydatidosis, echinococciasis, echinococcosis) a condition resulting from the presence in the liver, lungs, or brain of *hydatid cysts. The cysts of Echinococcus multilocularis form malignant tumours; those of E. granulosus exert pressure as they grow and thereby damage surrounding tissues. The presence of hydatids in the brain may result in blindness and epilepsy, and the rupture of any cyst can cause severe allergic reactions including fever and *urticaria. Treatment may necessitate surgical removal of the cysts. Spread of hydatid disease, particularly common in sheep-raising countries, can be prevented by the deworming of dogs.

hydatidiform mole a collection of fluid-filled sacs that develop when the membrane (chorion) surrounding the embryo degenerates in early pregnancy with proliferation of the *trophoblast. These sacs give the placenta the appearance of a bunch of grapes and a characteristic snowstorm appearance on ultrasound. The levels of hCG are abnormally high. Hydatidiform mole can be subdivided into complete and partial mole based on genetic and histological features. Complete moles show no evidence of fetal tissue; there is usually evidence of a fetus or fetal red blood cells with a partial mole. The widespread use of ultrasound has led to earlier diagnosis and has changed the pattern of molar pregnancy. The majority of women present with symptoms of early pregnancy failure. See gestational trophoblastic disease.

hydatidosis n. see hydatid disease.

hydr- (hydro-) combining form denoting water or a watery fluid.

hydraemia n. the presence in the blood of more than the normal proportion of water.

hydralazine n. a *vasodilator drug used, usually in conjunction with *diuretics, to treat hypertension. Side-effects, including rapid heart rate, headache, faintness, and digestive upsets, can occur, especially at high doses.

hydramnios n. see polyhydramnios.

hydrargyria n. see mercurialism.

hydrarthrosis n. swelling at a joint caused by excessive synovial fluid. The condition usually involves the knees and may be recurrent. Often no cause is apparent; in some cases rheumatoid arthritis develops later. Excess synovial fluid may also occur with other forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as psoriatic and reactive arthritis, as well as with osteoarthritis.

hydrocalycosis n. see caliectasis.

hydrocele n. the accumulation of watery liquid in a sac, usually the sac surrounding the testes. This condition is characterized by painless enlargement of the scrotum; it is treated surgically, by drainage of the fluid or removal of the sac.

hydrocephalus n. an abnormal increase in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain. In childhood, before the sutures of the skull have fused, hydrocephalus makes the head enlarge. In adults, because of the unyielding nature of the skull, hydrocephalus raises the intracranial pressure with consequent drowsiness and vomiting. Hydrocephalus may be caused by obstruction to the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles (obstructive hydrocephalus), a failure of its reabsorption into the cerebral sinuses, or increased production of CSF (communicating hydrocephalus). *Spina bifida may be associated with hydrocephalus in childhood. Treatment involves treating the underlying cause and, if necessary, diverting the excess cerebrospinal fluid into the abdominal cavity, where it is absorbed. This is achieved by tunnelling a thin tube from the ventricles to the abdomen (ventriculo-peritoneal shunt) or to the atrium of the heart (ventriculo-atrial shunt).

hydrochloric acid a strong acid present, in a very dilute form, in gastric juice. The secretion of excess hydrochloric acid by the stomach results in the condition *hyperchlorhydria.

hydrochlorothiazide n. a thiazide *diuretic used in combination with other drugs (e.g. *amiloride) to treat fluid retention (oedema) and high blood pressure.

hydrocortisone n. a pharmaceutical preparation of the steroid hormone *cortisol. Hydrocortisone is used in the treatment of adrenal failure (*Addison’s disease), shock, and inflammatory, allergic, and rheumatic conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis, colitis, and eczema). Possible side-effects include peptic ulcers, bone and muscle damage, suppression of growth in children, and the signs of *Cushing’s syndrome.

hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) an intensely poisonous volatile acid that can cause death within a minute if inhaled. It has a smell of bitter almonds. See cyanide.

hydrogenase n. an enzyme that catalyses the addition of hydrogen to a compound in reduction reactions.

hydrogen bond a weak electrostatic bond formed by linking a hydrogen atom between two electronegative atoms (e.g. nitrogen or oxygen). The large number of hydrogen bonds in proteins and nucleic acids are responsible for maintaining the stable molecular structure of these compounds.

hydrogen peroxide an oxidizing agent used as a skin disinfectant for cleansing wounds and treating superficial bacterial infections. Diluted hydrogen peroxide solution is used as a deodorant mouthwash for treating oral infections (e.g. ulcerative gingivitis). Strong solutions irritate the skin.

hydrolase n. an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of compounds. Examples are the *peptidases.

hydroma n. see hygroma.

hydronephrosis n. distension and dilatation of the pelvis of the kidney. This is due to an obstruction to the free flow of urine from the kidney. An obstruction at or below the neck of the bladder will result in hydronephrosis of both kidneys. The term primary pelvic hydronephrosis is used when the obstruction, usually functional, is at the junction of the renal pelvis and ureter. Surgical relief by *pyeloplasty is advisable to avoid the back pressure atrophy of the kidney and the complications of infection and stone formation. —hydronephrotic adj.

hydropericarditis n. see hydropericardium.

hydropericardium n. accumulation of a clear serous fluid within the membranous sac surrounding the heart. It occurs in many cases of *pericarditis (hydropericarditis). If the heart is compressed the fluid is withdrawn (aspirated) via a needle inserted into the pericardial sac through the chest wall (pericardiocentesis). See also hydropneumopericardium.

hydroperitoneum n. see ascites.

hydrophobia n. see rabies.

hydrophthalmos n. see buphthalmos.

hydropneumopericardium n. the presence of air and clear fluid within the pericardial sac around the heart, which is most commonly due to entry of air during pericardiocentesis (see hydropericardium). The presence of air does not affect the management of the patient.

hydropneumoperitoneum n. the presence of fluid and gas in the peritoneal cavity. This may be due to the introduction of air through an instrument being used to remove the fluid; because of a perforation in the digestive tract that has allowed the escape of fluid and gas; or rarely because gas-forming bacteria are growing in the peritoneal fluid.

hydropneumothorax n. the presence of air and fluid in the pleural cavity. If the patient is shaken the fluid makes a splashing sound (called a succussion splash). An *effusion of serous fluid commonly complicates a *pneumothorax, and must be drained.

hydrops n. an abnormal accumulation of fluid in body tissues or cavities. For example, corneal hydrops is the sudden painful accumulation of fluid in the cornea seen in *keratoconus. It results in a sudden reduction of vision. See also hydrops fetalis; Ménière’s disease.

hydrops fetalis the accumulation of fluid in fetal tissues or body cavities. This may take the form of a *cystic hygroma. In its most severe form, excessive fluid collects in the peritoneal cavity (see ascites), the pleural and pericardial cavities, and the soft tissues (see oedema). Hydrops may occur at any stage of gestation but is not usually seen until 16–18 weeks; the earlier it presents, the worse the prognosis. There are several causes of hydrops, one of which is severe anaemia associated with rhesus factor incompatibility (see haemolytic disease of the newborn). Other (nonimmune) causes include congenital heart defects, fetal arrhythmias, chromosomal abnormalities, and fetal infection with human *parvovirus B19 (erythrovirus). Treatment before birth with intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus may be undertaken in specialized fetal medicine units; without treatment the mortality is high. Prenatal ultrasound scanning enables early recognition of hydrops fetalis and has been enhanced with the introduction of MCA Doppler (see Doppler ultrasound).

hydrosalpinx n. the accumulation of fluid in one of the *Fallopian tubes due to inflammation and subsequent obstruction, usually as a result of pelvic infection.

hydrotherapy n. the use of water in the treatment of disorders, as by exercising in remedial swimming pools as part of the *rehabilitation of arthritic or partially paralysed patients.

hydrothorax n. fluid in the pleural cavity. See also hydropneumothorax.

hydrotubation n. the introduction of a fluid (usually a dye) through the cervix (neck) of the uterus under pressure to allow visualization, by *laparoscopy, of the passage of the dye through the Fallopian tubes. It is used to test whether or not the tubes are blocked in the investigation of infertility.

hydroureter n. an accumulation of urine in one of the tubes (ureters) leading from the kidneys to the bladder. The ureter becomes swollen and the condition usually results from obstruction of the ureter by a stone or a pelvic mass.

hydroxocobalamin n. a cobalt-containing drug used to treat conditions involving vitamin B12 deficiency, such as pernicious anaemia, and cyanide poisoning.

hydroxyapatite n. 1. a complex phosphate of calcium (Ca5(PO4)3OH) that occurs as a mineral and is the chief structural element of human bone and teeth. Hydroxyapatite crystals may also occur in joints in association with arthritis. 2. a biocompatible ceramic material that is a synthetic form of natural hydroxyapatite. Some joint replacement prostheses are coated with synthetic hydroxyapatite, which encourages bone to grow on to the implant. The material is also used in some forms of middle-ear surgery.

hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) n. a drug that prevents cell growth and is used mainly to treat chronic myeloid leukaemia but also to reduce the frequency of sickle-cell crises (see sickle-cell disease). Hydroxycarbamide may lower the white cell content of the blood due to its effects on the bone marrow.

hydroxychloroquine n. a drug similar to *chloroquine, used mainly to treat lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (see disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). Side-effects such as skin reactions, headache, and digestive upsets may occur and prolonged use can lead to eye damage.

5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) a metabolite of *serotonin, the most common secretion product of *carcinoid tumours. Measured over 24 hours in the urine, this is the most reliable screening test for such tumours.

hydroxyproline n. a compound, similar in structure to the *amino acids, found only in *collagen.

5-hydroxytryptamine n. see serotonin.

hydroxyurea n. see hydroxycarbamide.

hydroxyzine n. an *antihistamine drug with sedative properties, used to treat pruritus (itching). It may cause drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, and gastrointestinal upsets.

hygiene n. the science of health and the study of ways of preserving it, particularly by promoting cleanliness.

hygr- (hygro-) combining form denoting moisture.

hygroma (hydroma) n. a type of cyst. It may develop from the liquified remains of a subdural *haematoma (subdural hygroma). See also cystic hygroma.

hygrometer n. an instrument for measuring the relative humidity of the atmosphere, i.e. the ratio of the moisture in the air to the moisture it would contain if it were saturated at the same temperature and pressure. In the dew-point hygrometer a polished surface is reduced in temperature until the water vapour from the atmosphere forms on it. The temperature of this dew point enables the relative humidity of the atmosphere to be calculated. In the wet-and-dry bulb hygrometer, there are two thermometers mounted side by side, the bulb of one being surrounded by moistened muslin. The thermometer with the wet bulb will register a lower temperature than that with the dry bulb owing to the cooling effect of the evaporating water. The temperature difference enables the relative humidity to be calculated.

hymen n. the membrane that covers the opening of the vagina at birth but usually perforates spontaneously before puberty. If the initial opening is small it may tear, with slight loss of blood, at the first occasion of sexual intercourse.

Hymenolepis n. a genus of small widely distributed parasitic tapeworms. The dwarf tapeworm, H. nana, only 40 mm in length, lives in the human intestine. Fleas can be important vectors of this species, and children in close contact with flea-infested dogs are particularly prone to infection. H. diminuta is a common parasite of rodents; humans occasionally become infected on swallowing stored cereals contaminated with insect pests – the intermediate hosts for this parasite. Symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, and headache are obvious only in heavy infections of either species. Treatment involves a course of *anthelmintics.

hymenoplasty n. see female genital cosmetic surgery.

hymenotomy n. incision of the hymen at the entrance to the vagina. This operation may be performed on a young girl if the membrane completely closes the vagina and thus impedes the flow of menstrual blood. It is also carried out to alleviate dyspareunia (painful intercourse).

hyo- combining form denoting the hyoid bone. Example: hyoglossal (relating to the hyoid bone and tongue).

hyoglossus n. a muscle that serves to depress the tongue. It has its origin in the hyoid bone.

hyoscine (scopolamine) n. an *antimuscarinic drug that prevents muscle spasm. Hyoscine butylbromide is administered in the treatment of spasm in the digestive system and difficult or painful menstruation. Hyoscine hydrobromide is used for preoperative medication and to treat motion sickness. Side-effects of both drugs are rare but can include dry mouth, blurred vision, difficulty in urination, and increased heart rate.

hyp- (hypo-) prefix denoting 1. deficiency, lack, or small size. Example: hypognathous (having a small lower jaw). 2. (in anatomy) below; beneath. Example: hypoglossal (under the tongue).

hypalgesia n. an abnormally low sensitivity to pain.

hyper- prefix denoting 1. excessive; abnormally increased. 2. (in anatomy) above.

See also virilization.

hyperbaric adj. at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure.

hyperbaric oxygenation a technique for exposing a patient to oxygen at a pressure of greater than 1 atmosphere in a compression chamber. It is used to treat carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, compressed air illness, and acute breathing difficulties. It is also used in some cases during heart surgery. In dental extractions and implant treatment it may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients who have received radiation to the head and neck region (osteoradionecrosis).

hyperbilirubinaemia n. an excess of the *bile pigment bilirubin in the blood leading to the development of jaundice. Transient mild hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in the absence of significant liver disease (see Gilbert’s syndrome).

hypercalcaemia n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally high concentration of calcium. There are many causes, including excessive ingestion of vitamin D, overactivity of the *parathyroid glands, and malignant disease. Malignant hypercalcaemia results from the secretion by the tumour of substances (most commonly *parathyroid hormone-related protein) that stimulate bone resorption or from bone metastases causing localized destruction and release of calcium into the bloodstream. Hypercalcaemia may also occur as an inherited congenital condition, for example familial benign (or hypocalciuric) hypercalcaemia or *Williams syndrome. Compare hypocalcaemia.

hypercalcaemic nephropathy defects of kidney function related to a high serum calcium, irrespective of cause. Impaired urine-concentrating ability and reduction in glomerular filtration rate are common features.

hypercholesterolaemia n. the presence of elevated concentrations of *cholesterol in the blood (see also hyperlipidaemia), which predisposes to atheromatous disease (see atheroma). Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal *dominant condition in which raised levels of *low-density lipoprotein (LDL) result from a mutation in the LDL receptor gene, producing a deficiency of LDL receptors, which normally remove cholesterol from the circulation. The *heterozygous state, with LDL levels of 5–10 mmol/1, may not be detected until adulthood; usual signs are tendon *xanthomas on the backs of the hands and a *corneal arcus. The *homozygous state is much more serious as cardiovascular complications can occur in childhood, due to massively increased total cholesterol levels (>12 mmol/1).

hyperchromatism n. the property of the nuclei of certain cells (for example, those of tumours) to stain more deeply than normal. —hyperchromatic adj.

hyperdactylism (polydactylism) n. the condition of having more than the normal number of fingers or toes. The extra digits are commonly undersized (rudimentary) and are usually removed surgically shortly after birth.

hyperextension n. extension of a joint or limb beyond its normal limit.

hyperglycaemia n. an excess of glucose in the bloodstream. It may occur in a variety of diseases, most notably in *diabetes mellitus, due to insufficient insulin in the blood and excessive intake of carbohydrates. Untreated it may progress to diabetic coma.

hyperhidrosis (hyperidrosis) n. excessive sweating, which may occur in certain diseases, such as thyrotoxicosis or fevers, or following the use of certain drugs. More commonly, however, there is no underlying cause for this condition. There are many successful treatments, including topical preparations, antimuscarinic drugs, and injections of *botulinum toxin.

hyper-IgM syndrome an inherited immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by normal or high IgM levels with absence of IgA, IgG, and IgE (see immunoglobulin). Patients are susceptible to bacterial and opportunistic infections. Some cases are due to a mutation in the gene encoding the CD40 ligand, which is synthesized by *helper T cells and is involved in activation of B cells to produce circulating antibodies.

hyperinsulinism n. 1. excessive secretion of the hormone insulin by the islet cells of the pancreas. 2. metabolic disturbance due to administration of too much insulin.

hyperintense adj. (in CT scanning) describing a structure that is denser than surrounding structures (allows fewer X-rays to pass through) and therefore appears brighter on CT; for example, bones and calcifications. Compare hypointense.

hyperkalaemia n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally high concentration of *potassium, usually due to failure of the kidneys to excrete it. See also electrolyte.

hyperkeratosis n. thickening of the outer horny layer of the skin. It may occur as an inherited disorder, affecting the palms and soles. —hyperkeratotic adj.

Familial mixed hyperlipidaemia is an autosomal *dominant condition that occurs in 1 in 200 people and in up to 20% of those with early-onset cardiovascular disease. It is marked by elevation of triglycerides, *low-density lipoprotein, and/or *very low-density lipoprotein coupled with a reduction in *high-density lipoprotein.

hyperlipoproteinaemia n. the presence in the blood of abnormally high concentrations of *lipoproteins.

hypermetropia (long-sightedness) n. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus behind the retina when the *accommodation is relaxed (see illustration). Moderate degrees of hypermetropia may not cause blurred vision in children and young adults because of their ability to accommodate, but for older people and those with greater degrees of hypermetropia near vision is more blurred than distance vision. Normal vision can be restored by wearing spectacles with convex lenses. Compare emmetropia; myopia.

Hypermetropia (long-sightedness).





hypermobility (joint hypermobility) a common condition in which joints can be moved beyond the normal range of motion. Most people with hypermobility have no other symptoms. However, those with joint hypermobility syndrome may suffer many difficulties due to laxity of the ligaments as the joints may sprain or dislocate. This can lead to weakened joints, muscle fatigue, and chronic pain. Joint hypermobility syndrome may be symptomatic of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as *Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

hypermotility n. excessive movement or activity, especially of the stomach or intestine.

hypernatraemia n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally high concentration of *sodium. See also electrolyte.

hypernephroma n. see renal cell carcinoma.

hyperopia n. the usual US term for *hypermetropia.

hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) a state of extreme hyperglycaemia seen in type 2 diabetes accompanied by dehydration that can be severe, typically triggered by illness in a patient with type 2 diabetes or a patient with previously unknown type 2 diabetes. It was previously known as hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycaemia (HONK). Emergency hospital treatment is required to control blood glucose levels and to treat the dehydration and the underlying precipitating cause. There is a significant mortality, especially in the elderly and patients with other disorders (e.g. vascular disease). While insulin is required as part of the initial emergency treatment, the patient often does not need insulin in the longer term, when well.

hyperostosis n. excessive enlargement of the outer layer of a bone. The condition is harmless and is usually recognized as an incidental finding on X-ray. It commonly affects the frontal bone of the skull (hyperostosis frontalis). Infantile cortical hyperostosis (or Caffey’s disease) affects infants under six months. There is periodic swelling of the long bones, jaw, and shoulder blade, with pain and a fever. The condition settles spontaneously.

hyperparathyroidism n. excessive secretion of *parathyroid hormone, usually due to a small tumour in one of the parathyroid glands. It results in *hypercalcaemia. See also von Recklinghausen’s disease.

hyperphagia n. pathological overeating due to a loss of the normal regulatory processes.

hyperpiesia n. see hypertension.

hyperplasia n. the increased production and growth of normal cells in a tissue or organ without an increase in the size of the cells. The affected part becomes larger but retains its normal form. Hyperplasia can be physiological, as in the breasts during pregnancy, or pathological, as in benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland). See also endometrial hyperplasia. Compare hypertrophy; neoplasia.

hyperpnoea n. an increase in the rate of breathing that is proportional to an increase in metabolism; for example, on exercise. Compare hyperventilation.

hyperprolactinaemia n. see prolactin.

hyperpyrexia n. a rise in body temperature above 106°F (41.1°C). See fever.

hypersensitive adj. prone to respond abnormally to the presence of a particular antigen, which may cause a variety of tissue reactions ranging from *serum sickness to an allergy (such as hay fever) or, at the severest, to anaphylactic shock (see anaphylaxis). It is thought that when the normal antigen-antibody defence reaction is followed by tissue damage this may be due to an abnormality in the working of the *complement system. See also allergy; immunity. —hypersensitivity n.

hypersomnia n. sleep lasting for exceptionally long periods, as occurs in some cases of brain inflammation.

hypersplenism n. a decrease in the numbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets in the blood resulting from destruction or pooling of these cells by an enlarged spleen. Hypersplenism may occur in any condition in which there is enlargement of the spleen (see splenomegaly).

hypersthenia n. an abnormally high degree of strength or physical tension in all or part of the body.

hypertelorism n. an abnormally increased distance between two organs or parts, commonly referring to widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism). See Crouzon syndrome; Sotos syndrome.

hypertension n. high *blood pressure, i.e. elevation of the arterial blood pressure above the normal range expected in a particular age group. Hypertension may be of unknown cause (essential hypertension or hyperpiesia). It may also result from kidney disease, including narrowing (stenosis) of the renal artery (*renovascular hypertension), endocrine diseases (such as Cushing’s disease or phaeochromocytoma) or disease of the arteries (such as coarctation of the aorta), when it is known as secondary or symptomatic hypertension.

Complications that may arise from hypertension include atherosclerosis, heart failure, cerebral haemorrhage, and kidney failure, but treatment may prevent their development. Hypertension is symptomless until the symptoms of its complications develop. Some cases of hypertension may be cured by eradicating the cause. Most cases, however, depend upon long-term drug therapy to lower the blood pressure and maintain it within the normal range. The drugs used include thiazide *diuretics, *ACE inhibitors, *calcium-channel blockers, *beta blockers, and *alpha blockers. Combinations of drugs may be needed to obtain optimum control. See also portal hypertension; pulmonary hypertension.

hyperthermia (hyperthermy) n. 1. exceptionally high body temperature (about 41°C or above). See fever. 2. treatment of disease by inducing fever. Compare hypothermia.

hypertrichosis n. excessive growth of hair (see hirsutism).

hypertriglyceridaemia n. an excess of *triglyceride lipids in the serum, which can be caused by a genetic predisposition with or without a high-fat diet (see also lipoprotein lipase), excessive alcohol intake, or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The condition can predispose to cardiovascular disease and, in its extreme form, to acute pancreatitis. Lipid-lowering drugs, including *fibrates, are used in treatment.

hypertrophic cardiomyopathy a familial condition affecting the heart, characterized by unexplained thickening (hypertrophy) of the wall of the left ventricle. In many cases this is an incidental finding and patients have a good outcome. However, more severely affected patients may suffer chest pain, tachyarrhythmia (see arrhythmia), heart failure, and sudden death. In some cases there is focal thickening of muscle around the left ventricular outflow tract (asymmetric septal hypertrophy, ASH), and this can result in restriction of blood flow to the body (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, HOCM). The diagnosis is made by electrocardiography, echocardiography, and cardiac *magnetic resonance imaging. Usually drug treatment is sufficient to control symptoms, but some patients require cardiac *catheterization or surgical treatment. Those deemed at highest risk of sudden death may require an *implantable cardiovertor defibrillator.

hypertrophy (hypertrophia) n. increase in the size of a tissue or organ brought about by the enlargement of its cells rather than by cell multiplication (as during normal growth and tumour formation). Hypertrophy can be a physiological response to normal stimuli, as in the enlargement of skeletal muscles in response to increased work. Pathological hypertrophy occurs in response to abnormal stimuli, as in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension or aortic valve stenosis (see also hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Compare hyperplasia. —hypertrophic adj.

hypertropia n. see strabismus.

hyperuricaemia (lithaemia) n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally high concentration of uric acid. See gout.

hyperuricuria (lithuria) n. the presence in the urine of an abnormally high concentration of uric acid.

hyperventilation n. breathing at an abnormally rapid rate at rest. This causes a reduction of the carbon dioxide concentration of arterial blood, leading to dizziness, tingling (paraesthesiae) in the lips and limbs, tetanic cramps in the hands, and tightness across the chest. If continued, hyperventilation may cause loss of consciousness. This sequence of events occurs in the hyperventilation syndrome (HVS), which has been estimated to contribute to 10% of out-patient referrals to hospital.

hyperviscosity syndrome a collection of symptoms resulting from an increase in the viscosity of blood. These symptoms include epistaxis (nosebleed), blurred vision, dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, confusion, and breathlessness. Hyperviscosity of the blood occurs in conditions such as polycythaemia, plasma-cell myeloma, leukaemia, and Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia.

hypervitaminosis n. the condition resulting from excessive consumption of vitamins. This is not usually serious in the case of water-soluble vitamins, when any intake in excess of requirements is excreted in the urine. However, the fat-soluble vitamins A and D are toxic if taken in excessive amounts.

hypervolaemia n. an increase in the volume of circulating blood.

hyphaema n. a collection of blood in the anterior chamber (in front of the iris) of the eye.

Hypnotic suggestion may be used for a variety of therapeutic purposes; as a form of psychotherapy it is known as hypnotherapy.

hypnotic (soporific) n. a drug that produces sleep by depressing brain function. Hypnotics include benzodiazepines (such as *loprazolam, *nitrazepam, and *temazepam) and drugs that act at benzodiazepine receptor sites, such as zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Hypnotics are used for the short-term treatment of insomnia and sleep disturbances. Some of them (e.g. nitrazepam, *flurazepam) may cause hangover effects in the morning.

hypnotism n. the induction of *hypnosis.

hypo- prefix. see hyp-.

hypoadrenalism n. subnormal activity of the *adrenal glands, which can be due to disease of the adrenal glands themselves (e.g. *Addison’s disease) or to a lack of stimulation from the pituitary hormone *ACTH as part of any condition causing *hypopituitarism.

hypoaesthesia n. a condition in which the sense of touch is diminished; uncommonly this may be extended to include other forms of sensation.

hypobaric adj. at a pressure lower than that of the atmosphere.

hypochloraemia n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally low concentration of chloride.

hypochlorhydria n. reduced secretion of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. See achlorhydria.

hypochondriasis n. preoccupation with the physical functioning of the body and with imagined ill health. In the most severe form there are delusions of ill health, sometimes associated with underlying illness, such as *depression. When symptoms reach the level sufficient to be classified as a disorder, it is called illness anxiety disorder (in *DSM-5; formerly hypochondriasis) or hypochondriacal disorder (in ICD-10). Treatment with reassurance, *antidepressant drugs, and/or psychotherapy is common, but the condition is often chronic. —hypochondriac adj., n.

hypochondrium n. the upper lateral portion of the *abdomen, situated beneath the lower ribs. —hypochondriac adj.

hypocretin n. a recently discovered neuropeptide that originates in the hypothalamus. Low levels of hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid are found in most patients with *narcolepsy and may also be found in patients who have suffered with stroke, brain tumours, head injuries, and infections of the nervous system.

Hypoderma n. a genus of non-bloodsucking beelike insects – the warble flies – widely distributed in Europe, North America, and Asia. Cattle are the usual hosts for the parasitic maggots, but rare and accidental infections of humans have occurred (see myiasis), especially in farm workers. The maggots migrate beneath the skin surface, producing an inflamed linear lesion similar to that of *creeping eruption.

hypodermic adj. beneath the skin: usually applied to subcutaneous *injections. The term is also applied to the syringe used for such injections, and sometimes – loosely – to any injection.

hypodipsia n. pathological failure to drink enough to maintain the body’s normal plasma osmolality. Like its most extreme form, adipsia, it is most commonly due to lesions of the thirst centre in the anterior hypothalamus.

hypodontia n. congenital absence of one or more teeth (not including the third molars, whose absence is considered a normal variation). Forms of hypodontia include *oligodontia and *anodontia.

hypoechoic adj. (in ultrasound imaging) describing a darker area, which is usually caused by any structure (e.g. a cyst) that allows the sound waves to pass through and therefore reflects echoes to a lesser degree than the adjacent structure. Compare hyperechoic.

hypofibrinogenaemia (fibrinogenopenia) n. a deficiency of the clotting factor *fibrinogen in the blood, which results in an increased tendency to bleed. It may occur as an inherited disorder in which either production of fibrinogen is impaired or the fibrinogen produced does not function in the normal way (dysfibrinogenaemia). Alternatively, it may be acquired. For example, it is the commonest cause of blood coagulation failure during pregnancy, when the blood fibrinogen level falls below the normal pregnancy level of 4–6 g/l as a result of *disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This usually occurs as a complication of severe *abruptio placentae, prolonged retention of a dead fetus, or amniotic fluid embolism.

hypogammaglobulinaemia n. a deficiency of the protein *gammaglobulin in the blood. It may occur in a variety of inherited disorders or as an acquired defect, as in chronic lymphocytic *leukaemia (CLL). Since gammaglobulin consists mainly of antibodies (*immunoglobulins), hypogammaglobulinaemia results in an increased susceptibility to infections.

hypogastrium n. that part of the central *abdomen situated below the region of the stomach. —hypogastric adj.

hypogeusia n. a condition in which the sense of taste is abnormally weak. See also hypoaesthesia.

hypoglossal nerve the twelfth *cranial nerve (XII), which supplies the muscles of the tongue and is therefore responsible for the movements of talking and swallowing.

hypoglycaemia n. a deficiency of glucose in the bloodstream, causing muscular weakness and incoordination, mental confusion, and sweating. If severe it may lead to hypoglycaemic coma. Hypoglycaemia most commonly occurs in *diabetes mellitus, as a result of insulin overdosage and insufficient intake of carbohydrates. It is treated by administration of glucose: by injection if the patient is in a coma, by mouth otherwise. See also reactive hypoglycaemia. —hypoglycaemic adj.

hypoglycaemic unawareness a serious condition in which a person with diabetes loses the earliest warning signs of an approaching hypoglycaemic episode. Such people may suffer a severe attack of hypoglycaemia, with confusion, seizures, or even coma and death, because they fail to take the necessary measures to abort the episode. The condition is more common in longstanding diabetes and in those who experience frequent hypoglycaemic episodes. People with hypoglycaemic unawareness should not drive. Some awareness of hypoglycaemia may be restored by careful avoidance of more episodes, ensuring that the blood glucose level never falls below 4 mmol/l.

hypogonadism n. impaired function of the gonads (testes or ovaries), causing absence or inadequate development of the *secondary sexual characteristics. This may be due to a disorder of the gonads or to lack of secretion of the pituitary *gonadotrophins (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism).

hypohidrosis n. see anhidrosis.

hypoinsulinism n. a deficiency of insulin due either to inadequate secretion of the hormone by the pancreas or to inadequate treatment of diabetes mellitus.

hypointense adj. (in CT scanning) describing a structure or substance (e.g. gas) that is less dense than surrounding structures (allows more X-rays to pass through) and therefore appears darker on CT. Compare hyperintense.

hypokalaemia n. the presence of abnormally low levels of potassium in the blood: occurs in dehydration. See electrolyte.

hypokalaemic nephropathy abnormalities seen with chronic hypokalaemia (usually K+ <3.0 mmol/l) and manifest by impaired urine-concentrating ability and reduced capacity to excrete sodium. Histological changes include cytoplasmic vacuolation of the renal tubules and medullary fibrosis.

hypomania n. a mild degree of *mania. Elated mood leads to faulty judgment; behaviour lacks the usual social restraints and the sexual drive is increased; there is a reduced need for sleep; speech is rapid and pressured; the individual is energetic but not persistent and tends to be irritable or possibly aggressive. The abnormality is not as great as in mania (see elation; euphoria). Treatment follows the same principles as for mania, and it may be difficult to prevent an individual from damaging his or her own interests with extravagant behaviour; hospitalization would indicate that the severity of mania had been reached. —hypomanic adj.

hyponatraemia n. the presence in the blood of an abnormally low concentration of *sodium: occurs in dehydration. See electrolyte.

hypoparathyroidism n. subnormal activity of the parathyroid glands, causing a fall in the blood concentration of calcium and muscular spasms (see tetany).

hypopharynx (laryngopharynx) n. the part of the pharynx that lies below the level of the hyoid bone.

hypophysectomy n. the surgical removal or destruction of the pituitary gland (hypophysis) in the brain. The operation may be conducted by opening the skull or by the insertion of special needles that produce a very low temperature (see cryosurgery). Radiotherapy (e.g. by insertion of needles of *yttrium-90) can also be used to destroy parts of the pituitary.

hypophysis n. see pituitary gland.

hypophysitis n. a rare condition of inflammation of the *pituitary gland (hypophysis). The main cause is an infiltration by lymphocytes, most commonly during or just after pregnancy. This usually presents as a mass lesion of the pituitary with visual-field loss and headache or with anterior *hypopituitarism, which may be total or just involve particular hormone systems. Around 50% of cases are associated with other autoimmune endocrine diseases, and antipituitary antibodies have been identified.

hypopiesis n. abnormally reduced blood pressure in the absence of organic disease (see hypotension).

hypopituitarism n. subnormal activity of the pituitary gland, causing *dwarfism in childhood and a syndrome of impaired sexual function, pallor, and premature ageing in adult life (see Simmonds disease).

hypoplasia n. the underdevelopment of an organ or tissue. Dental hypoplasia is the defective formation of parts of a tooth, for example systemic upset while the tooth is being formed can lead to hypoplastic enamel. Pulmonary hypoplasia is deficient lung development in a fetus or newborn infant for gestational age, with a decrease in lung size or volume. —hypoplastic adj.

hypoplastic left heart a congenital heart disorder in which the left side of the heart, particularly the left ventricle, is underdeveloped. The first part of the aorta may also be abnormal. Affected babies usually develop severe heart failure within the first few days of life. Diagnosis can be confirmed on *echocardiography. Prognosis is generally very poor – most babies die within the first few weeks – but milder cases may be amenable to surgery. It is the commonest cause of death in the neonatal period due to heart disease.

hypoplastic leukaemia a stage of *leukaemia in which there is a decrease in the number of white cells, red cells, and platelets in the blood and reduced *haemopoiesis in the bone marrow.

hypopnoea n. an episode during sleep in which there is a reduction in the nasal airflow to less than 50% of normal, but more than 30% (see apnoea), for more than 10 seconds. See also obstructive sleep apnoea.

hypoproteinaemia n. a decrease in the quantity of protein in the blood. It may result from malnutrition, impaired protein production (as in liver disease), or increased loss of protein from the body (as in the *nephrotic syndrome). It results in swelling (*oedema), because of the accumulation of fluid in the tissues, and increased susceptibility to infections. See also hypogammaglobulinaemia.

hypoprothrombinaemia n. a deficiency of the clotting factor *prothrombin in the blood, which results in an increased tendency to bleed. It may occur as an inherited defect or as the result of liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or anticoagulant treatment.

hypopyon n. pus in the anterior chamber (in front of the iris) of the eye. Seen in severe cases of *uveitis or other ocular infections, it can be a sign of endophthalmitis following intraocular surgery.

hyposensitive adj. less than normally responsive to the presence of antigenic material. Compare hypersensitive. —hyposensitivity n.

hyposensitization n. see desensitization.

hyposmia n. reduction in the sense of smell. See anosmia.

hypospadias n. a congenital abnormality in which the opening of the *urethra is on the underside of the penis: either on the glans penis (glandular hypospadias), at the junction of the glans with the shaft (coronal hypospadias), on the shaft itself (penile hypospadias), or in the perineum (perineal hypospadias). All varieties can be treated surgically, and neither micturition nor sexual function need be impaired. See MAGPI operation.

hypostasis n. accumulation of fluid or blood in a dependent part of the body, under the influence of gravity, in cases of poor circulation. Hypostatic congestion of the lung bases may be seen in debilitated patients who are confined to bed. It predisposes to pneumonia (hypostatic pneumonia) but it may be prevented by careful nursing and physiotherapy. A similar condition (lividity) occurs after death when blood pools in the dependent parts of the body after the circulation has ceased. —hypostatic adj.

hyposthenia n. a state of physical weakness or abnormally low muscular tension.

hyposthenuria n. the secretion of urine of low specific gravity. The inability to concentrate the urine occurs in patients at the final stage of chronic renal failure.

hypotension n. a condition in which the arterial *blood pressure is abnormally low, which is most commonly experienced when rising from a sitting or lying position (postural or orthostatic hypotension). Severe cases may manifest as *shock.

hypothalamus n. the region of the forebrain in the floor of the third ventricle, linked with the thalamus above and the *pituitary gland below (see brain). It contains several important centres controlling body temperature, thirst, hunger, and eating, water balance, and sexual function. It is also closely connected with emotional activity and sleep and functions as a centre for the integration of hormonal and autonomic nervous activity through its control of the pituitary secretions (see neuroendocrine system; pituitary gland). —hypothalamic adj.

hypothenar adj. describing or relating to the fleshy prominent part of the palm of the hand below the little finger. Compare thenar.

hypothermia n. 1. accidental reduction of body temperature below the normal range in the absence of protective reflex actions, such as shivering. Often insidious in onset, it is particularly liable to occur in babies and the elderly if they are living in poorly heated homes and have inadequate clothing. 2. deliberate lowering of body temperature for therapeutic purposes. This may be done during surgery, in order to reduce the patient’s requirement for oxygen.

hypothetical imperative see imperative.

hypothyroidism n. subnormal activity of the thyroid gland. If present at birth and untreated it leads to *cretinism. When acquired in later life it causes mental and physical slowing, undue sensitivity to cold, slowing of the pulse, weight gain, and coarsening of the skin (myxoedema). Treatment is by thyroid hormone replacement therapy, usually in the form of *thyroxine. Primary hypothyroidism is due to intrinsic underactivity of the thyroid gland; secondary hypothyroidism is reduced stimulation of the gland caused by a deficiency of *thyroid-stimulating hormone due to disease of the pituitary gland.

hypotonia n. a state of reduced tension in muscle.

hypotonic adj. 1. describing a solution that has a lower osmotic pressure than another solution. See osmosis. 2. describing muscles that demonstrate diminished *tonicity.

hypotony n. a very low intraocular pressure, usually as a result of trauma or surgery to the eye.

hypotrichosis n. a condition in which less hair develops than normal.

hypotropia n. see strabismus.

hypoventilation n. breathing at an abnormally shallow and slow rate, which results in an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. Alveolar hypoventilation may be primary, which is very rare, or secondary, which can be due to destructive lesions of the brain or to an acquired blunting of respiratory drive arising from failure of the respiratory pump.

hypovitaminosis n. a deficiency of a vitamin caused either through lack of the vitamin in the diet or from an inability to absorb or utilize it.

hypovolaemia (oligaemia) n. a decrease in the volume of circulating blood. See shock.

hypoxaemia n. reduction of the oxygen concentration in the arterial blood, recognized clinically by the presence of central and peripheral *cyanosis. When the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) falls below 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg), the condition is defined as respiratory failure.

hypoxia n. a deficiency of oxygen in the tissues. See also anoxia; hypoxaemia.

hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, birth asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia) brain damage in a newborn infant as a result of the brain receiving inadequate oxygen. HIE may cause seizures and, if severe, death within minutes of oxygen deprivation. If the infant survives there can be significant long-term consequences, such as developmental delay, learning disabilities, or cerebral palsy.

hypsarrhythmia n. a severe abnormality on an EEG (see electroencephalography) that demonstrates a chaotic pattern of brain activity. It is usually characteristic of *infantile spasms.

hyster- (hystero-) combining form denoting 1. the uterus. 2. hysteria.

hysterectomy n. the surgical removal of the entire uterus through an incision in the abdominal wall (total abdominal hysterectomy, TAH), or through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy), or by minimal access (laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy, LAH). Subtotal hysterectomy (rarely performed now unless as a laparoscopic procedure) involves removing the body of the uterus but leaving the neck (cervix). Hysterectomy is performed for cancerous conditions affecting the uterus and for nonmalignant conditions (e.g. fibroids) in which there is excessive menstrual bleeding. Abdominal hysterectomy carries a higher risk of morbidity than vaginal hysterectomy; the latter is therefore the preferred route unless contraindicated. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is the recommended operation for *endometrial cancer.

hysteria n. a now obsolete name for a *neurosis characterized by emotional instability, repression, dissociation, some physical symptoms (see hysterical), and vulnerability to suggestion. Two types were recognized: conversion hysteria, now known as *conversion disorder; and dissociative hysteria, comprising a group of conditions now generally regarded as *dissociative disorders.

hysterical adj. formerly, describing a symptom that is not due to organic disease, is produced unconsciously, and from which the individual derives some gain. What were known as hysterical symptoms are characteristic of *conversion disorder.

hysterosalphingography n. radiological examination of the uterus and Fallopian tubes. A radiopaque contrast material is injected through a catheter placed in the uterine cavity and the flow is then observed with X-rays. The technique is used to look for patency of the Fallopian tubes in cases of infertility, or for any uterine anomalies or mass. See also sonohysterography.

hysterosalpingography n. X-ray imaging of the uterus and Fallopian tubes following injection of water or a soluble *contrast medium.

hysterosalpingosonography n. see HYCOSY.

hysteroscopy n. visualization of the interior of the uterus using a hysteroscope (a type of *endoscope). It can also be used for therapeutic procedures, such as polypectomy. —hysteroscopic adj.

hysterotomy n. an operation for removal of the fetus by incision of the uterus through the abdomen before the 24th week of gestation; after this time the operation is called *Caesarean section. Hysterotomy is now rarely performed owing to improvements in the efficiency of drugs now available for inducing abortion, e.g. *mifepristone.

ichor n. a watery material oozing from wounds or ulcers.

ichthyosis n. a genetically determined skin disorder (see genodermatosis) in which there is abnormal scaling of the skin (the scaly condition of the skin is reflected in the name of this disorder, which is derived from the Greek word for fish). Ichthyosis may be caused by a variety of genetic defects in skin shedding; the pattern of scaling varies according to the underlying defect. The commonest form, ichthyosis vulgaris, is inherited as an autosomal *dominant and occurs in 1 in 300 of the population. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare condition in which the skin, particularly on the palms and soles, is thickened and lizard-like. Treatment of ichthyosis is mainly by the regular use of emollients. See also xeroderma.

icodextrin n. a glucose polymer solution produced by the hydrolysis of cornstarch and containing a spectrum of polymer molecules with an average molecular weight of 16,200 Da. It is used in the dialysate treatment of renal failure by *peritoneal dialysis. It exerts a strong osmotic effect, allowing removal of fluid without exposing the peritoneum to high levels of glucose. It is of most use when the dialysate is required to remain within the body for a long period, for instance overnight during chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or during the day with automated peritoneal dialysis.

ICSH (interstitial-cell-stimulating hormone) see luteinizing hormone.

ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) a technique of assisted conception that has revolutionized the treatment of severe male infertility. Spermatozoa are aspirated or extracted from the testis or epididymis (see MESA; PESA) and a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of a secondary *oocyte in vitro. The fertilized ovum is then implanted into the uterus.

icterus n. see jaundice.

ictus n. a stroke or any sudden attack, such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The term is often used for an epileptic seizure, stressing the suddenness of its onset (see also aura; postictal phase).

id n. (in psychoanalysis) a part of the unconscious mind governed by the instinctive forces of *libido and the death instinct (governing aggression, etc.). These violent forces seek immediate release in action or in symbolic form. The id is therefore said to be governed by the pleasure principle and not by the demands of reality or of logic. In the course of individual development some of the functions of the id are taken over by the *ego.

-id suffix denoting relationship or resemblance to. Example: spermatid (a stage of sperm formation).

idea of reference see delusion of reference.

ideation n. the process of thinking or of having *imagery or ideas. The presence or absence of suicidal ideation is tested as part of every *mental state examination and risk assessment.

identical twins see twins.

ideo- combining form denoting 1. the mind or mental activity. 2. ideas.

idio- combining form denoting peculiarity to the individual.

idiopathic adj. denoting a disease or condition the cause of which is not known or that arises spontaneously. —idiopathy n.

idiopathic intracranial hypertension (benign intracranial hypertension, pseudotumour cerebri) a syndrome of raised pressure within the skull in the absence of a clear structural cause, such as a tumour. Although the cause is not certain, proposed mechanisms include impaired reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid or venous outflow from the brain. The symptoms include headache, vomiting, double vision, and *papilloedema. The diagnosis is made by finding a high opening pressure at *lumbar puncture in the absence of a causative structural abnormality on brain imaging. It can improve spontaneously but drug therapy or neurosurgical treatment may be required to protect the patient’s vision.

idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a serious interstitial lung disease, formerly called cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (see alveolitis). It is characterized by progressive fibrous scarring of the lung and increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the alveoli and surrounding tissues. The disease is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds on a basis of worsening breathlessness, inspiratory crackles at the lung bases on auscultation, clubbing of the fingers or toes, bilateral radiographic shadowing predominantly in the lower zones of the chest X-ray, subpleural *honeycomb change on CT scanning of the chest, and restrictive lung function on spirometry. It is also called usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; see interstitial pneumonia), a term used by lung pathologists for the most common cellular pattern seen on biopsy. Treatment includes *pirfenidone, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants.

idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) an *autoimmune disease in which platelets are destroyed, leading to spontaneous bruising (see purpura). Acute ITP is a relatively mild disease of children, who usually recover without treatment. A chronic form of the disease, typically affecting adults, is more serious, requiring treatment with corticosteroids or, if there is no response, with splenectomy. If both fail, immunosuppressant drugs may be effective. Platelet concentrates are used for life-threatening bleeding.

idiosyncrasy n. an unusual and unexpected sensitivity exhibited by an individual to a particular drug or food. Drug idiosyncrasy commonly takes the form of undue susceptibility or hypersensitivity, so that the standard dose causes an excessive effect; the normal effect is produced by a small fraction of the standard dose. —idiosyncratic adj.

idiotype n. the antigen-binding site of an antibody, which confers antigenicity.

idioventricular adj. affecting or peculiar to the ventricles of the heart. The term is most often used to describe the very slow beat of the heart’s ventricles under the influence of their own natural subsidiary pacemaker (idioventricular rhythm). An accelerated idioventricular rhythm of 80–120 beats per minute is often seen in patients a few hours after being admitted with a heart attack (see myocardial infarction). Its presence is a good sign since it usually indicates restoration of blood flow down the occluded coronary artery.

IFG impaired fasting glucose (see glucose tolerance test).

ifosfamide n. a *cytotoxic drug (an *alkylating agent) used in the treatment of malignant disease, particularly sarcomas, testicular tumours, and lymphomas. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and haemorrhagic cystitis; concomitant administration of *mesna is recommended to prevent cystitis.

Ig see immunoglobulin.

IgA nephropathy see Berger’s nephropathy.

IGF insulin-like growth factor, which includes IGF-I and IGF-II. See growth factor; somatomedin.

IGRT see image-guided radiotherapy.

IGT impaired glucose tolerance (see glucose tolerance test).

IL-2 n. see interleukin.

ile- (ileo-) combining form denoting the ileum. Examples: ileocaecal (relating to the ileum and caecum); ileocolic (relating to the ileum and colon).

ileal conduit a segment of small intestine (ileum) used to convey urine from the ureters to the exterior into an appliance (see also urinary diversion). The ureters are implanted into an isolated segment of bowel, usually ileum but sometimes sigmoid colon, one end of which is brought through the abdominal wall to the skin surface. This end forms a spout, or stoma, which projects into a suitable urinary appliance. The ureters themselves cannot be used for this purpose as they tend to narrow and retract if brought through the skin. The operation is performed if the bladder has to be removed or bypassed; for example, because of cancer.

ileal pouch (perineal pouch) a reservoir made from loops of ileum to replace a surgically removed rectum, avoiding the need for a permanent *ileostomy. This is commonly constructed in patients who have had their colon surgically removed for various disorders (e.g. ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis).

ileectomy n. surgical removal of the ileum (small intestine) or part of the ileum.

ileitis n. inflammation of the ileum (small intestine). It may be caused by *Crohn’s disease, tuberculosis, the bacterium *Yersinia enterocolitica, or typhoid or it may occur in association with *ulcerative colitis (when it is known as backwash ileitis).

ileocaecal valve a valve at the junction of the small and large intestines consisting of two membranous folds that close to prevent the backflow of food from the colon and caecum to the ileum.

ileocolitis n. inflammation of the ileum and the colon (small and large intestines). The most likely cause is *Crohn’s disease.

ileocolostomy n. a surgical operation in which the ileum is joined to part of the colon. It is usually performed when the right side of the colon has been removed or if it is desired to bypass either the terminal part of the ileum or right side of the colon.

ileocystoplasty n. see cystoplasty.

ileorectal anastomosis (ileoproctostomy) a surgical operation in which the ileum is joined to the rectum, usually after surgical removal of the colon (see colectomy).

ileostomy n. a surgical operation in which the ileum is brought through the abdominal wall to create an artificial opening (stoma) through which the intestinal contents can discharge, thus bypassing the colon. Various types of bag may be worn to collect the effluent. The operation is usually performed in association with a *colectomy; or to allow the colon to rest and heal in refractory cases of colitis; or following injury or surgery to the colon.

ileum n. the lowest of the three portions of the small *intestine. It runs from the jejunum to the *ileocaecal valve. —ileal, ileac adj.

ileus n. intestinal obstruction, usually obstruction of the small intestine (ileum). Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and absolute constipation. Paralytic or adynamic ileus is functional obstruction of the ileum due to loss of intestinal movement (peristalsis), which may be caused by abdominal surgery (see laparotomy); spinal injuries; electrolyte abnormalities, particularly of potassium (hypokalaemia); peritonitis; or ischaemia. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of fluid and removal of excess stomach secretions by nasogastric tube until peristalsis returns (the ‘drip and suck’ approach). If possible, the underlying condition is treated. Mechanical ileus may be caused by gallstones entering the bowel through a fistula or widened bile duct (gallstone ileus); tumour; *intussusception; intestinal *volvulus; foreign bodies; thickened *meconium in newborn babies (meconium ileus); or parasitic infestation, for example with the threadworm Enterobius vermicularis (verminous ileus).

ili- (ilio-) combining form denoting the ilium.

iliac arteries the arteries that supply most of the blood to the lower limbs and pelvic region. The right and left common iliac arteries form the terminal branches of the abdominal aorta. Each branches into the external iliac artery and the smaller internal iliac artery.

iliacus n. a flat triangular muscle situated in the area of the groin. This muscle acts in conjunction with the *psoas muscle to flex the thigh.

iliac veins the veins draining most of the blood from the lower limbs and pelvic region. The right and left common iliac veins unite to form the inferior vena cava. They are each formed by the union of the internal and external iliac veins.

iliopsoas n. a composite muscle made up of the *iliacus and *psoas muscles, which have a common tendon.

ilium n. the haunch bone: a wide bone forming the upper part of each side of the *hip bone (see also pelvis). There is a concave depression (iliac fossa) on the inside of the pelvis; the right iliac fossa provides space for the vermiform appendix. —iliac adj.

illness n. see disease.

illness anxiety disorder see hypochondria.

illusion n. a false perception due to misinterpretation of the stimuli arising from an object. For example, a patient may misinterpret a curtain cord as a snake. Illusions can occur in normal people, but they are usually spontaneously corrected. They may also occur in almost any psychiatric syndrome. Compare hallucination.

image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) the process of imaging during a course of radiation treatment to verify the internal position of the target in comparison to the initial planning scan. This enables adjustment of *treatment fields to improve coverage and allows the use of smaller treatment volumes. The possible methods for IGRT include cone beam CT, *tomotherapy, *cyberknife, and ultrasound and kilovoltage X-rays of implanted fiducial markers.

image-guided surgery see computer-assisted surgery.

image intensifier an electronic device that provides a TV image from an X-ray source. The X-rays strike a fluorescent screen after passing through the patient, giving off electrons, which are accelerated using an electron lens before striking a second fluorescent screen, which is usually attached to a video camera. The acceleration of the electrons amplifies the signal from the original image, giving a brighter picture, so that the radiation dose can be reduced. Images can be taken from the camera to be observed in real time on a video monitor or, using a brief higher-dose exposure, to provide a more detailed static image (see digital spot imaging).

imagery n. the production of vivid mental representations by the normal processes of thought. Eidetic imagery, more common in children than adults, is the production of images of exceptional clarity, which may be recalled long after being first experienced.

imaging n. (in radiology) the production of images of organs or tissues by a range of techniques. These images are used by physicians in diagnosis and in monitoring the effects of treatment. They can also be used to guide *interventional radiology techniques. See also computerized tomography; magnetic resonance imaging; ultrasonography.

imago n. (in psychoanalysis) the internal unconscious representation of an important person in the individual’s life, particularly a parent.

imatinib n. a *cytotoxic drug that works by inhibiting tyrosine kinases, enzymes that are active in some cancer cells (see tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Imatinib is used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia in which the *Philadelphia chromosome is present, *myeloproliferative disorders associated with abnormalities of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene, *gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The commonest side-effects are intestinal upset, fluid retention, and muscle pain and cramps.

imidazole n. one of a group of chemically related antifungal drugs that are also effective against a wide range of bacteria; some (e.g. *tiabendazole and *mebendazole) are also used as anthelmintics. The group includes *econazole, *clotrimazole, *ketoconazole, and *miconazole.

imipramine n. a drug administered by mouth to treat depression (see antidepressant) and, in children, bedwetting. Common side-effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, sweating, and rapid heartbeat.

imiquimod n. a drug used for treating anogenital warts, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and actinic *keratosis.

imitation n. acting in the same way as another person, either temporarily or permanently. It can be used in therapy (see modelling).

immersion foot see trench foot.

immobilization n. the procedure of making a normally movable part of the body, such as a joint, immovable. This helps infected, diseased, or injured tissue (bone, joint, or muscle) to heal. Immobilization may be temporary (for example, by means of a plaster of Paris cast on a limb) or it may be permanent. Permanent immobilization of a joint is achieved by means of *arthrodesis.

immune adj. protected against a particular infection by the presence of specific antibodies against the organisms concerned. See immunity.

immune response the response of the *immune system to antigens. There are two types of immune response produced by two populations of *lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (or B cells) are responsible for humoral immunity, producing free antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream; and T lymphocytes (or T cells) are responsible for cell-mediated immunity (see helper T cell; cytotoxic T cell; suppressor T cell).

immune system the organs responsible for *immunity. The primary *lymphoid organs are the thymus and the bone marrow; the secondary lymphoid organs are the lymph nodes and lymphoid aggregates (spleen, tonsils, gastrointestinal lymph tissue, and Peyer’s patches).

immunity n. the body’s ability to resist infection, afforded by the presence of circulating *antibodies and white blood cells. Healthy individuals protect themselves by means of physical barriers, phagocytic cells, *natural killer cells, and various blood-borne molecules. All of these mechanisms are present prior to exposure to infectious agents and are part of natural (or innate) immunity. Antibodies are manufactured specifically to deal with the antigens associated with different diseases as they are encountered. Active immunity arises when the body’s own cells produce, and remain able to produce, appropriate antibodies following an attack of a disease or deliberate stimulation (see immunization). Passive immunity, which is only short-lived, is provided by injecting ready-made antibodies in *antiserum taken from another person or an animal already immune. Babies have passive immunity, conferred by antibodies from the maternal blood and *colostrum, to common diseases for several weeks after birth. See also immune response.

immunization n. the production of *immunity by artificial means. Passive immunity, which is temporary, may be conferred by the injection of an *antiserum, but the production of active immunity calls for the use of treated antigens, to stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies: this is the procedure of *vaccination (also called inoculation). The material used for immunization (the *vaccine) may consist of live bacteria or viruses so treated that they are harmless while remaining antigenic or completely dead organisms or their products (e.g. toxins) chemically or physically altered to produce the same effect.

immuno- combining form denoting immunity or immunological response.

immunoassay n. any of various techniques for determining the levels of antigen and antibody in a tissue. See immunoelectrophoresis; immunofluorescence; radioimmunoassay.

immunocompromised adj. describing patients in whom the immune response is reduced or defective due to *immunosuppression. Such patients are vulnerable to opportunistic infections.

immunodeficiency n. deficiency in the *immune response. This can be acquired, as in *AIDS, but there are many varieties of primary immunodeficiency occurring as inherited disorders characterized by *hypogammaglobulinaemia or defects in T-cell function, or both.

immunoelectrophoresis n. a technique for identifying antigenic fractions in a serum. The components of the serum are separated by *electrophoresis and allowed to diffuse through agar gel towards a particular antiserum. Where the antibody meets its antigen, a band of precipitation occurs. See also precipitin.

immunofluorescence n. a technique for observing the amount and/or distribution of antibody or antigen in a tissue section. The antibodies are labelled (directly or indirectly) with a fluorescent dye (e.g. fluorescein) and applied to the tissue, which is observed through an ultraviolet microscope. In direct immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled before being applied to the tissue. In indirect immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled after it has bound to the antigen, by means of fluorescein-labelled anti-immunoglobulin serum. —immunofluorescent adj.

immunogenicity n. the property that enables a substance to provoke an immune response, including foreignness (see antigen), size, route of entry into the body, dose, number and length of exposures to the antigen, and host genetic make-up.

immunoglobulin (Ig) n. one of a group of structurally related proteins (*gammaglobulins) that act as antibodies. Several classes of Ig with different functions are distinguished – IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. They can be separated by *immunoelectrophoresis. See antibody.

immunological tolerance a failure of the body to distinguish between materials that are ‘self’, and therefore to be tolerated, and those that are ‘not self’, against which it mounts an *immune response. Tolerance results from the interaction of antigens with lymphocytes under conditions in which the lymphocytes are not activated but rendered unresponsive.

immunology n. the study of *immunity and all of the phenomena connected with the defence mechanisms of the body. —immunological adj.

immunosuppressant n. a drug, such as *azathioprine or *cyclophosphamide, that reduces the body’s resistance to infection and other foreign bodies by suppressing the immune system. Immunosuppressants are used to maintain the survival of organ and tissue transplants and to treat various *autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (see disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). *Ciclosporin is the immunosuppressant usually used in organ transplant recipients. Because immunity is lowered during treatment with immunosuppressants, there is an increased susceptibility to infection and certain types of cancer.

immunosuppression n. suppression of the *immune response, usually by disease (e.g. AIDS) or by drugs (e.g. steroids, azathioprine, ciclosporin).

immunotherapy n. the prevention or treatment of disease using agents that may modify the immune response. It is a largely experimental approach, studied most widely in the treatment of leukaemias (especially hairy-cell leukaemia), melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. See biological response modifier.

immunotoxin n. one of a class of compounds being studied for the treatment of certain cancers. Therapeutic immunotoxins combine *monoclonal antibodies, which can specifically target cancerous cells, with a highly toxic compound (such as *ricin) that inactivates the cells’ *ribosomes and thus inhibits protein synthesis. Because the toxin does not attack the whole cell only tiny amounts are required.

immunotransfusion n. the transfusion of an *antiserum to treat or give temporary protection against a disease.

impacted adj. firmly wedged. An impacted tooth (usually a wisdom tooth) is one that cannot erupt into a normal position because it is obstructed by other tissues. Impacted faeces are so hard and desiccated that they cannot pass spontaneously through the anus without medical (or surgical) intervention (see constipation). An impacted fracture is one in which the bone ends are driven into each other. —impaction n.

impaired fasting glucose (IFG) see glucose tolerance test.

impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) see glucose tolerance test.

impairment n. any loss or abnormality of body or mind sufficient to prevent or reduce normal functioning. See disability.

impalpable adj. describing a structure within the body that cannot be detected (or that can be detected only with difficulty) by feeling with the hand.

imperative n. in ethics, a rule, principle, or law used to direct or guide one’s actions. *Kantian ethics distinguishes between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. Whereas the latter are merely prudent or expedient and will vary with circumstances, the former are binding moral *duties and it is rational that they are applicable to all situations and people. See also deontology.

imperforate adj. lacking an opening. Occasionally girls at puberty are found to have an imperforate hymen (a fold of membrane close to the vaginal orifice), which impedes the flow of menstrual blood.

imperforate anus (proctatresia) partial or complete obstruction of the anus: a congenital malformation in which the anal canal fails to develop correctly and the rectum ends blindly above the muscles of the perineum. Many types exist, including developmental anal stenosis, persistent anal membrane, and covered anus (due to fused genital folds). Most mild cases of imperforate anus can be treated by a simple operation. If the defect is extensive a temporary opening is made in the colon (see colostomy), with later surgical reconstruction of the rectum and anus.

impetigo n. a superficial bacterial infection of the skin. Nonbullous impetigo is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, or both organisms; it mainly affects young children and is highly contagious, with yellowish-brown crusting. Bullous impetigo is caused by Staph. aureus; it is characterized by blisters, is less contagious than the nonbullous form, and occurs at any age. Treatment of impetigo is with topical or systemic antibiotics.

implant n. 1. a drug (such as a subcutaneous hormone implant), a prosthesis (such as an artificial hip, an intraocular lens implant (see cataract), a *breast implant, a *cochlear implant, or an artificial heart implant: see ventricular assist device), or a radioactive source (such as radium needles) that is put into the body. 2. (in dentistry) a rigid structure that is embedded in bone or under its periosteum to provide support for replacement teeth on a *denture, *crown, or *bridge. Recent types (osseointegrated implants) consist of a number of special titanium alloy inserts (fixtures), placed in the jawbone, onto which abutments are fitted after the bone has healed and fused with the fixture. Later an artificial-tooth superstructure is bolted onto the abutments. Osseointegrated implants are also used to retain facial *prostheses. See also osseointegration.

implantable cardiovertor defibrillator (ICD) a self-contained device, similar to a *pacemaker, that monitors heart rhythm and delivers an electric shock to correct life-threatening arrhythmia. See also defibrillator.

implantable hearing aid a form of hearing aid in which a small electrical vibrator is surgically attached to the auditory *ossicles. An external device with a microphone and an electronic processing unit passes information to the implanted device using radio-frequency waves. The external part is located behind the pinna and is powered by batteries.

implantable loop recorder (ILR) a device, inserted beneath the skin of the chest, to record the heart rhythm for up to two years. It is usually used for the investigation of patients presenting with infrequent syncope (fainting) in whom arrhythmia is the suspected cause. When syncope occurs, the device can be examined using wireless technology to reveal the heart rhythm at the time of the episode.

implantation n. 1. (nidation) the attachment of the early embryo to the lining of the uterus, which occurs at the *blastocyst stage of development, six to eight days after ovulation. The site of implantation determines the position of the placenta. 2. the placing of a substance (e.g. a drug) or an object (e.g. an artificial pacemaker) within a tissue. 3. the surgical replacement of damaged tissue with healthy tissue (see transplantation).

impotence n. inability of a man to have sexual intercourse (*coitus). See erectile dysfunction.

impression n. (in dentistry) a negative imprint (mould) of the teeth and surrounding soft tissues or of a toothless jaw. A soft impression material (e.g. silicone or alginate) is placed over the teeth or jaw and sets within several minutes, producing an elastic mould. Impressions may also be taken with hard-setting materials (e.g. plaster or zinc oxide–eugenol cement). From the impression, a positive reproduction (cast or model) can be made out of plaster or stone. On these are constructed *restorations of teeth, *dentures, or *orthodontic appliances.

imprinting n. 1. (in animal behaviour) a rapid and irreversible form of learning that takes place in some animals during the first hours of life. Animals attach themselves in this way to members of their own species, but if they are exposed to creatures of a different species during this short period, they become attached to this species instead. 2. (in genetics) a phenomenon whereby gene expression depends on whether the chromosome is maternal or paternal in origin. For example, both *Prader-Willi syndrome and *Angelman syndrome are caused by a *deletion of the same part of chromosome 15. When the deletion involves the chromosome 15 that came from the father, the child has Prader-Willi syndrome; inheritance of the same deletion from the mother results in Angelman syndrome.

impulse n. (in neurology) see nerve impulse.

IMRT see intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

in- (im-) prefix denoting 1. not. 2. in; within; into.

inanition n. a condition of exhaustion caused by lack of nutrients in the blood. This may arise through starvation, malnutrition, or intestinal disease.

inappetence n. lack of desire, usually for food.

in articulo mortis Latin: at the moment of death.

inborn error of metabolism any one of a group of inherited conditions in which there is a disturbance in either the structure, synthesis, function, or transport of protein molecules. There are over 1500 inborn errors of metabolism; examples are *phenylketonuria, *homocystinuria, and *hypogammaglobulinaemia.

inbreeding n. the production of offspring by parents who are closely related; for example, who are first cousins or siblings. The amount of inbreeding in a population is largely controlled by culture and tradition. Compare outbreeding.

incarcerated adj. confined or constricted so as to be immovable: applied particularly to a type of *hernia.

incidence rate a measure of morbidity based on the number of new episodes of illness arising in a population over a period of time. It can be expressed in terms of affected persons or episodes per 1000 individuals at risk. Compare prevalence.

incidentaloma n. a growth found incidentally on (usually) an adrenal gland (adrenal incidentaloma) during CT or MRI scanning of the abdomen or thorax for other clinical reasons. These growths are rarely significant, particularly if small, but they may be pathological if the patient has symptoms (e.g. hypertension, flushing) that could be attributable to an adrenal tumour.

incision n. the surgical cutting of soft tissues, such as skin or muscle, with a knife or scalpel. The site and type of incision depends on the area needed to be accessed during the procedure and lines of skin tension (Langer’s lines). See diagram.

Incisions.





incisional hernia a hernia that occurs through a defect at the site of a previous surgical incision.

incisor n. any of the four front teeth in each jaw, two on each side of the midline. They are normally spade-shaped and narrow-edged for cutting. See also dentition.

incisure n. (in anatomy) a notch, small hollow, or depression.

inclusion bodies particles occurring in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells usually as a result of virus infection. Their presence can sometimes be used to diagnose such an infection.

inclusion conjunctivitis a sexually transmitted disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It can be transmitted to infants at birth, with the disease clinically apparent 5–13 days after birth. Diagnosis is by cell culture. Treatment in the newborn is with topical erythromycin; adults require oral tetracycline or doxycycline for three weeks.

income support an income-related benefit payable to those whose income and savings do not exceed a specified maximum level and who do not work full-time. It is currently being replaced by *universal credit.

incompatibility n. see compatibility.

incompetence n. 1. impaired function of the valves of the heart or veins, which allows backward leakage of blood. See aortic regurgitation; mitral regurgitation; varicose veins. 2. (incapacity) impairment of mental functioning such that a person is unable to understand, retain, and weigh up information so as to communicate a choice or preference. 3. inability to fulfil the responsibilities and meet the standards of care expected of individuals working in a professional role in health care.

incontinence n. 1. (urinary incontinence) the inappropriate involuntary passage of urine, resulting in wetting. Stress incontinence is the loss of urine on exertion (e.g. coughing and straining). It is common in women in whom the muscles of the pelvic floor are weakened after childbirth. Urodynamic stress incontinence (formerly called genuine stress incontinence) in women is due to a simultaneous rise in bladder and abdominal pressure that exceeds urethral pressure without a contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder. Overflow incontinence is leakage from a full bladder, which occurs most commonly in elderly men with bladder outlet obstruction or in patients with neurological conditions affecting bladder control. Urge incontinence is leakage of urine that accompanies an intense desire to pass water with failure of restraint. It is frequently caused by *detrusor instability. See also enuresis. 2. (faecal incontinence, anal incontinence) inability to control bowel movements, causing involuntary loss of faeces or flatus.

incoordination n. (in neurology) an impairment in the performance of precise movements. These are dependent upon the normal function of the whole nervous system, and incoordination may result from a disorder in any part of it, especially the *cerebellum. See apraxia; ataxia; dysmetria.

incretin n. any one of a group of gastrointestinal hormones that cause a decrease in blood glucose levels by stimulating an enhanced release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells after eating. Thus they help to regulate the rise in blood glucose levels after eating and they have some additional actions that can enhance satiety – through effects on the brain and through gastrointestinal effects, such as delayed gastric emptying. Incretin-based drugs mimic the effects of the incretin *glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). They include *GLP-1 receptor agonists and *DPP-IV inhibitors.

incubation n. 1. the process of development of an egg or a culture of bacteria. 2. the care of a premature baby in an *incubator.

incubation period (latent period) 1. the interval between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms. 2. (in bacteriology) the period of development of a bacterial culture.

incubator n. a transparent container for keeping premature babies in controlled conditions and protecting them from infection. Other forms of incubator are used for cultivating bacteria in Petri dishes and for hatching eggs.

incus n. a small anvil-shaped bone in the middle *ear that articulates with the malleus and the stapes. See ossicle.

independent contractors (in Britain) *general practitioners, *dentists, and others who are not employees of the *National Health Service but who receive payment to provide an agreed level of service.

Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) a person who must, by virtue of the *Mental Capacity Act 2005, be contacted to represent the *best interests of a patient who lacks *capacity and has no family or friends while acting as a proxy in medical decision-making. IMCAs are available via the local Independent Mental Capacity Advocacy Service.

Inderal-LA n. see propranolol.

indican n. a compound excreted in the urine as a detoxification product of *indoxyl. Indican is formed by the conjugation of indoxyl with sulphuric acid and potassium on the decomposition of tryptophan.

indicanuria n. the presence in the urine of an abnormally high concentration of *indican. This may be a sign that the intestine is obstructed.

indication n. (in medicine) 1. a strong reason for believing that a particular course of action is desirable. In a wounded patient, the loss of blood, which would lead to circulatory collapse, is an indication for blood transfusion. 2. any of the conditions for which a particular drug treatment may be prescribed, as defined by its *licence. Compare contraindication.

indigestion n. see dyspepsia.

indinavir n. see protease inhibitor.

indocyanine green angiography see angiography.

indole n. a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan, excreted in the urine and faeces. Abnormal patterns of urinary indole excretion are found in some mentally retarded patients.

indolent adj. describing a disease process that is failing to heal or has persisted. The term is applied particularly to ulcers of skin or mucous membrane.

indometacin (indomethacin) n. an anti-inflammatory drug (see NSAID), used mainly for the relief of pain and severe inflammation in the treatment of rheumatic disease and similar disorders. Common side-effects are headache, dizziness, and digestive upsets. It is also used in the treatment of patent *ductus arteriosus.

indoramin n. an *alpha blocker drug used to treat high blood pressure and to relieve urinary retention due to benign enlargement of the *prostate gland. Possible side-effects can include drowsiness, nasal congestion, dry mouth, and failure of ejaculation.

indoxyl n. an alcohol derived from *indole by bacterial action. It is excreted in the urine as *indican.

induced abortion see abortion.

inducer n. see delusion by proxy; double delusion; folie à deux.

induction n. 1. (in obstetrics) the starting of labour by artificial means. It is carried out using such drugs as *prostaglandins to prime the cervix and/or *amniotomy prior to synthetic *oxytocin (Syntocinon), which stimulate uterine contractions. Induction of labour is carried out if the wellbeing or life of mother or child is threatened by continuance of the pregnancy. 2. (in anaesthesia) initiation of *anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is usually induced by the intravenous injection of short-acting *anaesthetics, e.g. thiopental.

induction loop system (loop system) a device for helping people with some types of *hearing aid or *cochlear implant to hear more effectively in certain situations. Electrical signals from a television, sound system, or microphone are passed through an amplifier to a wire that is positioned in a loop encompassing the desired listening area. This creates an electromagnetic field that can be picked up by a coil within the hearing aid or cochlear implant. Induction loops are installed in such places as public buildings, lecture theatres, classrooms, and churches. See also assistive listening device.

induration n. abnormal hardening of a tissue or organ. See also sclerosis.

indusium n. a thin layer of grey matter covering the upper surface of the *corpus callosum between the two cerebral hemispheres.

industrial disease see occupational disease.

industrial injuries disablement benefit a state benefit payable to a person disabled by injury or a prescribed industrial disease sustained or contracted in the course of employment (see occupational disease; prescribed disease). The benefit is payable as a weekly amount. The amount of the benefit depends on the degree of disablement as determined following assessment by a specialist. To be entitled to benefit, the disablement must be assessed as being at least 20% of total disability (1% in the case of pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, and diffuse mesothelioma). The benefit is payable if the claimant is still suffering disability two months or more after the date of the accident or onset of the disease. It is payable for a period assessed as the time for which the claimant is likely to suffer the disability. The assessment can be reviewed if the claimant’s condition deteriorates or if he or she is still disabled at the end of the period of assessment.

inertia n. (in physiology) sluggishness or absence of activity in certain smooth muscles. In uterine inertia the muscular wall of the uterus fails to contract adequately during labour, making the process excessively long. This inertia may be present from the start of labour or it may develop because of exhaustion following strong contractions and can lead to increased risk of atonic *postpartum haemorrhage. See also shoulder dystocia.

in extremis Latin: at the point of death.

infant n. a child incapable of any form of independence from its mother: the term is usually used to refer to a child under one year of age, especially a premature or newborn child. In legal use the term denotes a child up to the age of seven years.

infanticide n. (in England and Wales) under the terms of the Infanticide Act 1938, the killing of an infant by the natural mother within 12 months of birth. Where it can be shown that the woman’s balance of mind was disturbed due to childbirth and/or lactation she would not normally be charged with murder but with infanticide, which carries a much lighter sentence. As a result, it is uncommon for a mother who kills her infant child to receive a custodial sentence. Following a report from the Law Commission in 2006, there have been repeated calls for the law to be reformed so that a defence of diminished responsibility is automatically available in such cases.

infantile adj. 1. denoting conditions occurring in adults that are recognizable in childhood, e.g. poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) and infantile scurvy. 2. of, relating to, or affecting infants.

infantile spasms (salaam attacks) a rare but serious form of epilepsy that usually begins between three and eight months of age. The spasms are involuntary flexing movements of the arms, legs, neck, and trunk; each spasm lasts 1–3 seconds and is associated with flushing of the face, and runs of spasms occur over a period of several minutes. They may occur many times in one day. The baby fails to respond to human contact and development is usually profoundly slowed. An EEG pattern of *hypsarrhythmia is usual and diagnostic. Diagnosis may be delayed as spasms are sometimes confused with colic. Immediate recognition and treatment with antiepileptic medication, corticosteroids, or ACTH offers a chance of arresting the disease, but outcome depends primarily on the nature of the underlying brain abnormality.

infantilism n. persistence of childlike physical or psychological characteristics into adult life.

infant mortality rate (IMR) the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births in a given year. Included in the IMR are the neonatal mortality rate (calculated from deaths occurring in the first four weeks of life) and postneonatal mortality rate (from deaths occurring from four weeks). Neonatal deaths are further subdivided into early (first week) and late (second, third, and fourth weeks). In prosperous countries neonatal deaths account for about two-thirds of infant mortalities, the majority being in the first week (in the UK the major cause is prematurity and related problems). The IMR is usually regarded more as a measure of social affluence than a measure of the quality of antenatal and/or obstetric care; the latter is more truly reflected in the *perinatal mortality rate.

infarct n. see infarction.

infarction n. the death of part or the whole of an organ that occurs when the artery carrying its blood supply is obstructed by a blood clot (thrombus) or an *embolus. For example, *myocardial infarction, affecting the muscle of the heart, follows coronary thrombosis. A small localized area of dead tissue produced as a result of an inadequate blood supply is known as an infarct. Infarcts also arise when venous outflow from an organ or tissue is obstructed, as occurs when the ovary or testis twist on their vascular pedicles (stalks), or when the sigmoid colon twists in *volvulus.

infection n. invasion of the body by harmful organisms (pathogens), such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, rickettsiae, or viruses. The infective agent may be transmitted by a patient or *carrier in airborne droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing or by direct contact, such as kissing or sexual intercourse (see sexually transmitted disease); by animal or insect *vectors; by ingestion of contaminated food or drink; or from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy or birth. Pathogenic organisms present in soil, organisms from animal intermediate hosts, or those living as *commensals on the body can also cause infections. Organisms may invade via a wound or bite or through mucous membranes. After an *incubation period symptoms appear, usually consisting of either localized inflammation and pain or more remote effects. Treatment with antibiotics is usually effective against most infections, but there are few specific treatments for many of the common viral infections, including the common cold (see antiviral drug; interferon).

infectious disease see communicable disease.

infectious mononucleosis see glandular fever.

inferior adj. (in anatomy) lower in the body in relation to another structure or surface.

inferior dental block (inferior alveolar nerve block) a type of injection to anaesthetize the inferior *dental nerve. Inferior dental block is routinely performed to allow dental procedures to be carried out on the lower teeth on one side of the mouth.

inferior dental canal a bony canal in the *mandible on each side. It carries the inferior *dental nerve and vessels and for part of its length its outline is visible on a radiograph.

inferiority complex 1. an unconscious and extreme exaggeration of feelings of insignificance or inferiority, which may be shown by behaviour that is defensive or compensatory (such as aggression). 2. (in Freudian psychoanalysis) a *complex said to result from the conflict between Oedipal wishes (see Oedipus complex) and the reality of the child’s lack of power. This gives rise to repressed feelings of personal inferiority if not worked through.

infertility n. inability in a woman to conceive or in a man to induce conception after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for two years. Female infertility may be due to failure to ovulate, to obstruction of the *Fallopian tubes, or to disease of the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Possible treatments (depending on the cause) include administration of drugs (such as *clomifene or *gonadorelin analogues), surgery (see salpingography; salpingostomy; salpingolysis) to restore patency of the Fallopian tubes, *gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), and *in vitro fertilization. Causes of male infertility include decreased numbers or motility of spermatozoa (see oligospermia) and total absence of sperm (see azoospermia). See also andrology; sterility.

infestation n. the presence of animal parasites either on the skin (for example ticks) or inside the body (for example tapeworms).

infibulation n. see female genital mutilation.

infiltration n. 1. the abnormal entry of a substance (infiltrate) into a cell, tissue, or organ. Examples of infiltrates are blood cells, cancer cells, fat, starch, or calcium and magnesium salts. Infiltration can occur when a vein is damaged and the fluid being infused continues to leak out and accumulate in the surrounding tissue (also known as ‘tissuing’). This can result in inflammation. 2. the injection of a local anaesthetic solution into the tissues to cause local *anaesthesia. Infiltration anaesthesia is routinely used to anaesthetize upper teeth to allow dental procedures to be carried out.

inflammation n. the body’s response to injury, which may be acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the immediate defensive reaction of tissue to any injury, which may be caused by infection, chemicals, or physical agents. It involves pain, heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function of the affected part. Blood vessels near the site of injury are dilated, so that blood flow is locally increased. White blood cells enter the tissue and begin to engulf bacteria and other foreign particles. Similar cells from the tissues (see macrophage) remove and consume the dead cells, sometimes with the production of pus, enabling the process of healing to commence. In certain circumstances healing does not occur and chronic inflammation ensues.

inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) a group of inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by relapsing and remitting inflammation. The most common types are *ulcerative colitis and *Crohn’s disease.

infliximab n. a *monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of *tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α; see cytokine inhibitor). It is used to treat severe Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis that have failed to respond to treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants and antirheumatic drugs, respectively. Side-effects include intestinal upset, flushing, and allergic reactions.

influenza n. a highly contagious virus infection that affects the respiratory system. Types A and B are the forms that most commonly cause outbreaks in humans. The viruses are transmitted by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms commence after an incubation period of 1–4 days and include headache, fever, loss of appetite, weakness, and general aches and pains. They may continue for about a week. With bed rest and aspirin most patients recover, but a few may go on to develop pneumonia, either a primary influenzal viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Either of these may lead to death from haemorrhage within the lungs. The main bacterial organisms responsible for secondary infection are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, against which appropriate antibiotic therapy must be given.

An influenzal infection provides later protection only against the specific strain of virus concerned; the same holds true for immunization. Strains are classified according to the presence of different subtypes of two glycoproteins (antigens) on the viral surface: *haemagglutinin (H) and *neuraminidase (N). Small changes in the structure of these antigens, which occur frequently in influenza A and B viruses, require the continual development of new vaccines to protect against annual outbreaks of the disease. Major changes in antigenic structure occur much more rarely, when there is genetic recombination between strains that can infect more than one species (most strains of the virus are highly species-specific). However, when it does occur, it could result in the development of hybrid strains causing new forms of influenza that are difficult to contain; the pandemic of 1918–19 is thought to have arisen in this way (see also avian influenza; swine influenza).

Information Commissioner the person in charge of the independent public agency set up to regulate the use and storage of personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (see data protection). The office of the Information Commissioner both regulates the use of data under the Act and takes any enforcement action required as a result of noncompliance with the principles of the statute. The Information Commissioner’s office also promotes public access to official information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

informed consent the principle that requires clinicians to provide sufficient information to patients or potential research participants in order to render their *consent lawful. How much information and of what kind is regarded as sufficient depends on the seriousness of what is proposed and on the understanding of those from whom consent is required.

infra- prefix denoting below.

infracolic omentectomy see omentectomy.

infrared radiation the band of electromagnetic radiation that is longer in wavelength than the red of the visible spectrum. Infrared radiation is responsible for the transmission of radiant heat. It may be used in physiotherapy to warm tissues, reduce pain, and improve circulation, but is not as effective as *diathermy for deep structures. Special photographic film, which is sensitive to infrared radiation, is used in *thermography.

infundibulum n. any funnel-shaped channel or passage, particularly the hollow conical stalk that extends downwards from the hypothalamus and is continuous with the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland.

infusion n. 1. the slow injection of a substance, usually into a vein (intravenous (IV) infusion). This is a common method for replacing water, electrolytes, and blood products and is also used for the continuous administration of drugs (e.g. antibiotics, painkillers) or *nutrition. See also drip. 2. the process whereby the active principles are extracted from plant material by steeping it in water that has been heated to boiling point (as in the making of tea). 3. the solution produced by this process.

initiation n. (in oncology) the first step in the development of cancer (see carcinogenesis).

initiator (in oncogenesis) n. a substance that induces an irreversible change in a cell’s DNA that can result in a cancer. An example is dimethylbenzanthracene. Compare promoter.

injection n. introduction into the body of drugs or other fluids by means of a syringe, usually drugs that would be destroyed by the digestive processes if taken by mouth. Common routes for injection are into the skin (intracutaneous or intradermal); below the skin (subcutaneous), e.g. for insulin; into a muscle (intramuscular), for drugs that are slowly absorbed; and into a vein (intravenous, IV), for drugs to be rapidly absorbed. *Enemas are also regarded as injections.

injury scoring system (injury severity scale, ISS) a system used, particularly in *triage, for grading the severity of an injury. See also abbreviated injury scale.

inlay n. 1. a substance or piece of tissue placed within a tissue, generally to replace a defect. For example, a bone graft may be inlaid into an area of missing or damaged bone, or an aortic prosthesis placed using an inlay technique within an aneurysm. 2. (in dentistry) a rigid restoration inserted into a tapered cavity in a tooth. It is held in place with a cement *lute. While cast gold has been the most widely used material, porcelain and composite resin are also used.

inosine pranobex a *antiviral drug that is administered by mouth to treat herpes simplex infections (cold sores and genital herpes) and genital warts.

inositol n. a compound, similar to a hexose sugar, that is a constituent of some cell phospholipids. Inositol is present in many foods, in particular in the bran of cereal grain. It is sometimes classified as a vitamin but it can be synthesized by most animals and there is no evidence that it is an essential nutrient in humans.

inositol triphosphate (IP3) a short-lived biochemical *second messenger formed from *phospholipid in the cell membrane when a chemical messenger (e.g. a hormone or serotonin) binds to receptors on the cell surface. Inositol triphosphate triggers the rapid release of calcium into the cell fluid, which initiates various cellular processes, such as smooth muscle contraction and the release of glucose, histamine, etc. Inositol triphosphate exists for only a few seconds before being converted to inositol by the action of a sequence of enzymes.

inotropic adj. affecting the contraction of heart muscle. Drugs such as *dobutamine, *dopamine, and *enoximone have positive inotropic action, stimulating heart muscle contractions and causing the heart rate to increase. *Beta-blocker drugs, such as *propranolol, have negative inotropic action, reducing heart muscle contractions and causing the heart rate to decrease.

Inoue balloon see mitral stenosis; valvuloplasty.

in-patient n. a patient who is admitted to a bed in a hospital ward and remains there for a period of time for treatment, examination, or observation. Compare out-patient.

inquest n. an official judicial enquiry into the cause of a person’s death: carried out when the death is sudden or takes place under suspicious circumstances. The results of medical and legal investigations that have been carried out are considered by a *coroner, sitting with or without a jury, and made publicly known. See also autopsy.

INR International Normalized Ratio: the ratio of a patient’s *prothrombin time (PT; i.e. the time taken for the patient’s blood to clot) to a standardized ‘normal’ PT. It is used to monitor anticoagulant (usually warfarin) dosage. A normal INR is up to 1.2. Treatment usually aims to keep the ratio 2.0–3.0.

insanity n. a degree of mental illness such that the affected individual is not responsible for his actions or is not capable of entering into a legal contract. The term is a legal rather than a medical one.

insect n. a member of a large group of mainly land-dwelling *arthropods. The body of the adult is divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen. The head bears a single pair of sensory antennae; the thorax bears three pairs of legs and, in most insects, wings (these are absent in some parasitic groups, such as lice and fleas). Some insects are of medical importance. Various bloodsucking insects transmit tropical diseases, for example the female Anopheles mosquito transmits malaria and the tsetse fly transmits sleeping sickness. The bites of lice can cause intense irritation and, secondarily, bacterial infection. The organisms causing diarrhoea and dysentery can be conveyed to food on the bodies of flies. See also myiasis.

insecticide n. a preparation used to kill insects. Ideally, an insecticide should have no toxic effects when ingested by human beings or animals, but modern powerful compounds have inherent dangers and have caused fatalities. Some insect powders contain organic phosphorus compounds and fluorides; when ingested accidentally they may cause damage to the nervous system. The use of such compounds is generally under strict control. See also DDT; dieldrin.

insemination n. introduction of semen into the vagina. See also artificial insemination; intrauterine insemination.

insertion n. (in anatomy) the point of attachment of a muscle (e.g. to a bone) that is relatively movable when the muscle contracts. Compare origin.

insight n. one’s level of awareness of one’s illness. Insight can be fully or partially intact or absent. Full insight requires an understanding that one has an illness, seeks help, and complies with treatment. Insight can be impaired temporarily through drug intoxication or through medical or mental illness or permanently after brain damage or in some cases of *dementia. The term is also applied in psychology to the patient’s accuracy of understanding the development of his or her personality and problems; in this sense insight can be enhanced by psychotherapy.

insolation n. exposure to the sun’s rays. See also heatstroke.

insomnia n. inability to fall asleep or to remain asleep for an adequate length of time. Insomnia may be associated with physical disease, particularly if there are painful symptoms, or psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, or mania.

inspiration n. see inhalation.

inspissated adj. (of secretions, etc.) thickened or dried by evaporation or dehydration.

instillation n. 1. the application of liquid medication drop by drop, as into the eye. 2. the medication, such as eye drops, applied in this way.

instinct n. 1. a complex pattern of behaviour innately determined, which is characteristic of all individuals of the same species. The behaviour is released and modified by environmental stimuli, but its pattern is relatively uniform and predetermined. 2. an innate drive that urges the individual towards a particular goal (for example, *libido in psychoanalytic psychology).

institutionalization n. a condition produced by long-term residence in an impersonal institution (such as some residential care homes and orphanages) where stimulation is lacking. The individual adapts to the behaviour characteristic of the institution to such an extent that he or she finds it difficult to function in other environments. The features often include apathy, dependence, social withdrawal or awkwardness, and a lack of personal responsibility. The effects of institutionalization on mental health can be significant and informed the move towards more care in the community.

insufficiency n. inability of an organ or part, such as the heart or kidney, to carry out its normal function.

insufflation n. the act of blowing gas or a powder, such as a medication, into a body cavity.

insula n. an area of the *cerebral cortex that is overlapped by the sides of the deep lateral sulcus (cleft) in each hemisphere.

insulin n. a protein hormone, produced in the pancreas by the beta cells of the *islets of Langerhans, that is crucial in regulating the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin secretion is stimulated by a high concentration of blood sugar. Lack of this hormone gives rise to *diabetes mellitus, in which large amounts of sugar are present in the blood and urine. This condition may be treated successfully by insulin injections (see insulin analogues; insulin pen; isophane insulins). See also continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

insulin analogues a group of synthetic human insulins with specific alterations in their amino-acid sequences designed to modify their rate of absorption from the subcutaneous injection site. Some are absorbed more rapidly and have a shorter duration of action than conventional short-acting human insulin; others are absorbed more slowly at a more consistent rate than conventional medium-acting *isophane insulin to give a more sustained control of fasting and premeal blood glucose levels and therefore a reduced risk of *hypoglycaemia. These analogues include the short-acting insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro; the long-acting insulin detemir and insulin glargine; and the ultra-long-acting insulin degludec.

insulinase n. an enzyme, found in such tissues as the liver and kidney, that is responsible for the normal breakdown of insulin in the body.

insulinoma n. an insulin-producing and usually benign tumour of the beta cells in the *islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Symptoms can include sweating, faintness, episodic loss of consciousness, and other features of *hypoglycaemia (see Whipple’s triad). Single tumours can be removed surgically. Multiple very small tumours scattered throughout the pancreas cannot be treated by surgery but do respond to drugs that poison the beta cells, including *diazoxide.

insulin pen a user-friendly penlike device designed to inject a measured dose of insulin, typically containing 3 ml insulin (300 units in total) in a cartridge chamber. For each injection a new disposable needle is applied to the device. The insulin dose is then ‘dialled up’ and safely injected subcutaneously. The pen can be capped off and easily stored in a pocket or small bag; some types are disposable when the cartridge is empty, while others can be refilled with a new cartridge.

insulin resistance diminution in the response of the body’s tissues to insulin, so that higher concentrations of serum insulin are required to maintain normal circulating glucose levels. Eventually the islet cells can no longer produce adequate amounts of insulin for effective glucose lowering, resulting in hyperglycaemia. Insulin resistance is one of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. See also diabetes mellitus; metabolic syndrome.

insulin shock a condition of severe *hypoglycaemia. If not treated with glucose or glucagon, coma and death can occur.

insulin stress test an important but potentially dangerous test of anterior pituitary function involving the deliberate induction of a hypoglycaemic episode with injected insulin and the subsequent measurement of plasma cortisol and growth hormone at regular intervals over the next three hours. The stress of the hypoglycaemia should induce a rise in the levels of these hormones unless the anterior pituitary or the adrenal glands are diseased. The test can induce epileptic seizures or angina in those with a predisposition and should not be performed in susceptible individuals. It is often combined with the thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) test and the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test in what is known as the triple test (or dynamic pituitary function test).

insult n. an injury or physical trauma.

Intal n. see cromoglicate.

integrated care pathway a multidisciplinary plan for delivering health and social care to patients with a specific condition or set of symptoms. Such plans are often used for the management of common conditions and are intended to improve patient care by reducing unnecessary deviation from best practice. See clinical governance.

integrated governance see clinical governance.

integration n. the blending together of the *nerve impulses that arrive through the thousands of synapses at a nerve cell body. Impulses from some synapses cause *excitation, and from others *inhibition; the overall pattern decides whether an individual nerve cell is activated to transmit a message or not.

integrity n. moral honesty, consistency, and truthfulness: one of the requirements of *professionalism. Integrity is particularly important in health care, where patients are vulnerable in all sorts of ways; it implies that someone can be trusted to behave well beyond their particular role.

integument n. 1. the skin. 2. a membrane or layer of tissue covering any organ of the body.

intelligence quotient (IQ) an index of intellectual development. In childhood and adult life it represents intellectual ability relative to the rest of the population; in children it can also represent rate of development (*mental age as a percentage of chronological age). The population’s IQ follows almost a normal distribution curve. Most *intelligence tests are constructed so that the resulting intelligence quotients in the general population have a *mean of about 100 and a *standard deviation of about 15. An IQ of below 80 is considered to be indicative of *learning disability.

intelligence test a standardized assessment procedure for the determination of intellectual ability. The score produced is usually expressed as an *intelligence quotient. Most tests present a series of different kinds of problems to be solved. The best known are the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), and the Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale. Scores on intelligence tests are used for such purposes as the diagnosis of *learning disability and the assessment of intellectual deterioration.

intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) radiotherapy using multiple beams with variable intensity across each field, resulting in dose distributions that can fit to concave shapes and thus reduce dose to surrounding healthy tissues and organs. It can be used to treat a wide range of cancers and can enable safe delivery of higher doses to tumours.

intensive therapy unit (ITU, intensive care unit) a hospital unit designed to give intensive care, provided by specialist multidisciplinary staff, to a selected group of seriously ill patients or to those in need of special postoperative techniques (e.g. those patients undergoing complex heart or lung procedures).

intention n. 1. a process of healing. Healing by first intention is the natural healing of a wound or surgical incision when the edges are brought together under aseptic conditions and *granulation tissue forms. In healing by second intention the wound edges are separated and the cavity is filled with granulation tissue over which epithelial tissue grows from the wound edges. In healing by third intention the wound ulcerates, granulations are slow to form, and a scar forms at the wound site. 2. evaluation of a person’s aims or purpose in undergoing an action, which is important for the assessment and attribution of responsibility in ethicolegal questions and defined legally for the purposes of criminal law. See also doctrine of double effect.

intention to treat analysis a research process in which results are reported according to the treatment arm to which a research subject was assigned, rather than the treatment eventually received. Intention to treat analysis is very widely used in clinical research as a method of avoiding *bias resulting from nonrandom withdrawal from the trial or crossover between treatment arms.

intention tremor see tremor.

inter- prefix denoting between. Examples: intercostal (between the ribs); intertrochanteric (between the trochanters).

intercalated adj. describing structures, tissues, etc., that are inserted or situated between other structures.

intercellular adj. situated or occurring between cells.

intercostal muscles muscles that occupy the spaces between the ribs and are responsible for controlling some of the movements of the ribs. The superficial external intercostals lift the ribs during inspiration; the deep internal intercostals draw the ribs together during expiration.

intercurrent adj. going on at the same time: applied to an infection contracted by a patient who is already suffering from an infection or other disease.

interferon n. a substance that is produced by cells infected with a virus and has the ability to inhibit viral growth (see cytokines). Interferon is active against many different viruses, but particular interferons are effective only in the species that produces them. There are three types of human interferon: alpha (from white blood cells), beta (from fibroblasts), and gamma (from lymphocytes).

Human interferon can be produced in bacterial host cells by *genetic engineering for clinical use. Interferon alfa is used in treating hepatitis B and C and certain lymphomas and other cancers, peginterferon alfa is used for hepatitis B and C, and interferon beta for multiple sclerosis. Side-effects, including flulike symptoms, lethargy, and depression, may be severe.

interkinesis n. 1. the resting stage between the two divisions of *meiosis. 2. see interphase.

interleukin n. any of a family of proteins that control some aspects of haemopoiesis and the immune response (see cytokines). Many interleukins are currently characterized. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is an inflammatory mediator. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates T lymphocytes to become *natural killer cells, active against cancer cells, and is being investigated for the treatment of cancer: recombinant interleukin 2 (aldesleukin, Proleukin), administered by subcutaneous injection, can be of benefit in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

intermediate care a health and social care service that aims to facilitate earlier discharge from hospital or prevent admission to hospital by providing support at a level between *primary care and *secondary care. Intermediate care is provided on a short-term basis, usually no longer than six weeks.

intermittent claudication see claudication.

intermittent fever a fever that rises, subsides, then returns again. See malaria.

intermittent pneumatic compression a technique to prevent thrombosis in bedridden patients. It uses an inflatable device that squeezes the calf when it inflates, preventing pools of blood forming behind the valves in the veins, thus mimicking the effects of walking.

intermittent self-catheterization (clean intermittent self-catheterization, ISC, CISC) a procedure in which the patient periodically passes a disposable catheter through the urethra into the bladder for the purpose of emptying it of urine. It is increasingly used in the management of patients of both sexes (including children) with chronic *retention and large residual urine volumes, often due to *neuropathic bladder. ISC may prevent back pressure and dilatation of the upper urinary tract with consequent infection and incontinence.

intern n. in the USA and some other countries, a trainee doctor, serving in a hospital, who does not yet have a full licence to practise (compare resident). The UK equivalent is the so-called foundation doctor, a postgraduate who has embarked on the two-year *Foundation Programme of training (see doctor).

internal medicine general adult medicine, with a focus on acute, chronic, and complex conditions. A doctor who specializes in this area in a hospital setting is sometimes called an internist. From August 2019 all entrants to the British medical profession must undergo a three-year programme of Internal Medicine Training after completion of the *Foundation Programme (see Appendix 9).

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) a list of all known diseases and syndromes, including mental and behavioural disorders, published by the *World Health Organization every ten years (approximately). Over the years the classification has moved from being disease-orientated to include a wider framework of illness and other health problems. The version in current use, ICD-10, was published in 1992 and employs alphanumeric coding. It is used in many countries as the principal means of classifying both mortality and morbidity experience and allows comparison of morbidity and mortality rates nationally and internationally. The clinical utility of the ICD is a matter of some controversy, especially in the field of psychiatry. ICD-11 was published in June 2018 and is intended to come into use from 2022. It includes about 55,000 codes for injuries, diseases, and causes of death, which is three times more than its predecessor. It also differs substantially from ICD-10 as each disease entry includes descriptions and guidance as to what is covered by the term, rather than the term alone. For the first time it includes specific sections on sexual health and traditional medicine. A parallel list, the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health (ICF), has also been compiled and is being used alongside the ICD. See also handicap.

International Normalized Ratio see INR.

International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) a self-administered questionnaire, completed by men with *lower urinary tract symptoms, which consists of seven questions based on the extent of symptoms and a single quality-of-life question. It gives a numerical score, on a scale of 0 to 35, to indicate the severity of the patient’s symptoms. A score of 0–7 indicates mild symptoms, 8–19 moderate symptoms, and 20–35 severe symptoms. The quality-of-life question is scored from 0–6.

interneuron n. a neuron in the central nervous system that acts as a link between the different neurons in a *reflex arc. It usually possesses numerous branching processes (dendrites) that make possible extensive and complex circuits and pathways within the brain and spinal cord.

internode n. the length of *axon covered with a myelin sheath. Internodes are separated by nodes of Ranvier, where the sheath is absent.

internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) see ophthalmoplegia.

interpeduncular adj. situated between the peduncles of the cerebrum or cerebellum.

interphase (interkinesis) n. the period when a cell is not undergoing division (mitosis), during which activities such as DNA synthesis occur.

intersex n. the condition of a person born with physical characteristics that do not conform clearly to those of either sex. An intersex person may have ambiguous genitals, or some sort of mismatch between their genitals and/or secondary sexual characteristics on the one hand and their chromosomes and/or internal reproductive system on the other. The term covers some 30 or 40 rare conditions officially classified as disorders of sex development (DSDs), although the phrase differences of sex development is now sometimes preferred. The extent to which medical intervention is appropriate is a matter of ongoing debate. As a purely physical condition, intersex should not be confused with *gender dysphoria.

interstice n. a small space in a tissue or between parts of the body. —interstitial adj.

interstitial cells cells that form part of the connective tissue (interstitium) between other tissues, especially the cells interspersed between the seminiferous tubules of the *testis (also called Leydig cells). They secrete *androgens in response to stimulation by *luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.

interstitial-cell-stimulating hormone see luteinizing hormone.

interstitial cystitis a chronic nonbacterial inflammation of the bladder accompanied by an urgent desire to pass urine frequently and bladder pain; it is sometimes associated with an ulcer in the bladder wall (Hunner’s ulcer). The cause is unknown and *contracture of the bladder eventually occurs. Treatment is by distension of the bladder under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, instillation of anti-inflammatory solutions into the bladder, and administration of steroids or *NSAIDs. Bladder enhancement or augmentation (see cystoplasty) may be required for a contracted bladder.

interstitial nephritis disease of the *tubulointerstitium of the kidney. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) represents in many cases an allergic reaction to drugs (especially ampicillin, cephalexin, NSAIDs, allopurinol, and frusemide). AIN can also be associated with acute infections and autoimmune disease. Thirst and polyuria may be prominent, and renal function severely affected. In allergic cases, the use of steroids hastens recovery after the allergen has been removed. Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is associated with progressive scarring of the tubulointerstitium, often with lymphocyte infiltration. Primary causes of CIN include gout, radiation nephropathy, sarcoidosis, *analgesic nephropathy, reflux nephropathy, chronic hypokalaemia and hypercalcaemia, and *Aristolochia-associated nephropathies. Management of CIN involves removal of the precipitating cause, where identified, and control of hypertension.

interstitial pneumonia (interstitial pneumonitis) an alternative name for *idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis used by lung pathologists to classify the different cellular types of the disease. The most common cellular pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). A differing cellular pattern is seen in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), who have a better prognosis than those with UIP. There are two variants of NSIP: cellular and fibrosing. The former has chronic inflammatory cells with minimal collagen deposition, while the latter consists of diffuse interstitial fibrosis with fewer inflammatory cells. It is believed that corticosteroid therapy can slow the progression of cellular to fibrosing NSIP.

intertrigo n. superficial inflammation of two skin surfaces that are in contact, such as between the thighs or under the breasts, particularly in obese people. It is caused by friction and sweat and is often aggravated by infection, especially with Candida.

interventional cardiology a subspecialty of cardiology concerned with the treatment of heart conditions using cardiac *catheterization techniques under local anaesthetic and X-ray control, including *percutaneous coronary intervention and percutaneous balloon mitral *valvuloplasty.

interventional radiology a branch of radiology in which complex procedures are performed using imaging guidance, which avoids patients having to undergo invasive surgery to achieve the same results. This is often termed ‘pinhole surgery’. Guidance is commonly by X-ray fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or computerized tomography, and recently also by magnetic resonance imaging. Procedures commonly performed include angioplasty and stenting of vascular structures, drainage of fluid collections or abscesses, stenting of obstructions to the gastrointestinal tract, embolization, cryotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.

intervention study a comparison of the outcome between two or more groups of patients that are deliberately subjected to different regimes to test a hypothesis, usually of treatment (in a clinical trial). Wherever possible those entering the trial should be allocated to their respective groups by means of random numbers, and one such group (the control group) should have no active treatment (randomized controlled trial). Ideally neither the patient nor the person assessing the outcome should be aware of which group each patient is allocated to. In a blind trial, the patients are not aware of their group; in a double-blind trial, neither the patients nor the doctor or observer are aware of the therapy group. The groups may exchange treatment after a prearranged period (cross-over trial). Randomized controlled trials are increasingly used to assess new treatments against current standards; for example, to compare new chemotherapeutic agents to established treatment (the control group). To be ethically sound, there must not be evidence at the time of the study to show conclusively which arm of the trial is the best (see equipoise).

intervertebral disc the flexible plate of fibrocartilage that connects any two adjacent vertebrae in the backbone. At birth the central part of the disc – the nucleus pulposus – consists of a gelatinous substance, which gradually becomes replaced by cartilage with age. The intervertebral discs account for one quarter of the total length of the backbone; they act as shock absorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord from the impact produced by running and other movements. A tear in the outer fibrous portion of the disc results in displacement of the nucleus pulposus to varying degrees: protrusion, prolapse (see prolapsed intervertebral disc), extrusion, or sequestration.

intestinal flora bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract. Some are responsible for the synthesis of *vitamin K. By producing a highly acidic environment in the intestine they may also prevent infection by pathogenic bacteria that cannot tolerate such conditions.

intestinal juice see succus entericus.

intestinal obstruction partial or complete blockage of the bowel producing symptoms of vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain due to failure to pass intestinal contents. Causes may be mechanical or nonmechanical (see ileus). Acute obstruction may be due to incarcerated hernias, adhesions, or malignancy; chronic obstruction may be secondary to tumours, strictures, anatomical abnormality, or neurological disease. Conservative management is by intravenous fluid replacement and nasogastric decompression (‘drip and suck’). Most cases of mechanical obstruction require surgical intervention.

intestine (bowel, gut) n. the part of the *alimentary canal that extends from the stomach to the anus. It is divided into two main parts – the small intestine and the large intestine. The small intestine is divided into the *duodenum, *jejunum, and *ileum. It is here that most of the processes of digestion and absorption of food take place. The surface area of the inside of the small intestine is increased by the presence of finger-like projections called villi (see illustration). Glands in the mucous layer of the intestine secrete digestive enzymes and mucus. The large intestine consists of the *caecum, vermiform *appendix, *colon, and *rectum. It is largely concerned with the absorption of water from the material passed from the small intestine. The contents of the intestines are propelled forwards by means of rhythmic muscular contractions (see peristalsis). —intestinal adj.

Intestine. Longitudinal section through the ileum.





intima (tunica intima) n. 1. the inner layer of the wall of an *artery or *vein. It is composed of a lining of endothelial cells and an elastic membrane. 2. the inner layer of various other organs or parts.

in-toe gait (in-toeing, pigeon toe) a common foot deformity, noted at birth, in which the forefoot points inward (see tibial torsion). Most cases are self-correcting during childhood, but in severe cases surgery may be indicated. Medical names: metatarsus adductus, metatarsus varus.

intolerance n. the inability of a patient to tolerate a particular drug, manifested by various adverse reactions.

intoxication n. the symptoms of poisoning due to ingestion of any toxic material, including alcohol and heavy metals.

intra- prefix denoting inside; within. Examples: intralobular (within a lobule); intraosseous (within the bone marrow); intrauterine (within the uterus).

intracellular adj. situated or occurring inside a cell or cells.

intracorneal adj. within the cornea.

intracranial adj. within the skull.

intracranial hypotension headache an increasingly recognized type of persistent headache in a patient with no history of headaches. Features include headache that is worse on standing and resolves on lying flat. It may be associated with other symptoms, such as dizziness, tinnitus, and (rarely) *diplopia. The commonest cause is a complication of lumbar puncture, but it may occur spontaneously (spontaneous intracranial hypotension) after a dural tear resulting in a leak of cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment is with bed rest and increased intake of fluids; caffeine orally or intravenously is also used. In cases that do not resolve, an epidural blood patch procedure is performed, in which a small quantity of the patient’s blood is slowly injected into the *epidural space to seal the leak.

intracytoplasmic sperm injection see ICSI.

intradermal adj. within the skin. An intradermal injection is made into the skin.

Intraosseous needles enable fluids and drugs to be given rapidly. They are only for use with unconscious patients and must be removed when alternative access is obtained.

intrapartum adj. occurring during labour or childbirth.

intrastromal adj. (in ophthalmology) within the *stroma of the cornea.

intrastromal keratomileusis an operation to correct severe degrees of myopia (short-sightedness). A disc of corneal tissue (from the *stroma of the cornea) is removed, frozen, and remodelled on a lathe, then replaced into the cornea to alter its curvature and thus reduce the myopia. *Excimer laser treatment, which is easier to perform, has now replaced this (see LASIK).

intrathecal adj. 1. within the *meninges of the spinal cord. An intrathecal injection is made into the meninges. 2. within a sheath, e.g. a nerve sheath.

intrauterine fetal death death of a fetus in the uterus after 24 weeks of gestation. See stillbirth.

intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR, fetal growth restriction) failure of a fetus to achieve its growth potential, resulting in the birth of a baby whose birth weight is abnormally low in relation to its gestational age (see small for gestational age). Causes include *uteroplacental insufficiency, maternal disease (e.g. infection, malnutrition, high blood pressure, smoking, and alcoholism), poor socioeconomic conditions, multiple pregnancy (e.g. twins), and fetal disease or chromosomal abnormalities. It may be associated with *preterm birth.

intrauterine insemination (IUI) a procedure for assisting conception in which carefully washed spermatozoa are injected into the uterus through the vagina at the time of ovulation, which is induced and monitored (using ultrasound) to determine the day of insemination. This procedure is used in cases of male infertility due to inability of the sperm to penetrate the cervical mucus or the barriers surrounding the ovum, in which case the sperm may be treated in vitro to improve their motility and *acrosome reaction. IUI is also used for donor insemination.

intrauterine system see IUS.

intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) a technique in which a micro *ultrasound transducer is mounted on a catheter, which is then advanced over a guidewire into a blood vessel. IVUS is used to accurately assess the diameter of the blood vessels before any treatment, to assess any internal abnormality within the blood vessels, or to help mark the blood vessel branches during any stent placement.

Intravascular ultrasound.





intravenous adj. into or within a vein. See infusion; injection.

intravenous feeding see artificial nutrition and hydration; nutrition.

intravenous pyelography (IVP) see pyelography.

intravenous urography (IVU) X-ray imaging of the urinary tract following the injection into a vein of a radiopaque *contrast medium. This material is concentrated and excreted by the kidneys, and the IVU reveals the ureters and bladder. An IVU provides information about kidney function and may reveal the presence of stones, tumours, obstructions, or anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract. See also pyelography.

intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) see periventricular haemorrhage.

intraversion n. see introversion.

intra vitam Latin: during life.

intravitreal adj. within the vitreous humour of the eye.

intro- prefix denoting in; into.

introitus n. (in anatomy) an entrance into a hollow organ or cavity.

introjection n. (in psychoanalysis) the process of adopting, or of believing that one possesses, the qualities of another person. This can be a form of *defence mechanism.

intromission n. the introduction of one organ or part into another, e.g. the penis into the vagina.

introversion n. 1. (intraversion) an enduring personality trait characterized by interest in the self rather than the outside world. People high in introversion (introverts), as measured by questionnaires and psychological tests, tend to have a small circle of friends, like to persist in activities once they have started, and are highly susceptible to permanent *conditioning. Introversion was first described by Carl Jung as a tendency to distancing oneself from others, to philosophical interests, and to reserved defensive reactions. Compare extroversion. 2. a turning inwards of a hollow organ (such as the uterus) on itself.

intubation n. the introduction of a tube into part of the body for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. Thus gastric intubation may be performed to keep the stomach empty during and after abdominal surgery and to provide feeding and drugs when the patient is unable to swallow. In endotracheal intubation an endotracheal tube is inserted through the mouth into the trachea to maintain an airway in an unconscious or anaesthetized patient. It requires expert knowledge for insertion, using a laryngoscope, and has a small cuff at the far end for inflation inside the trachea. It affords the best level of protection of the airway from vomitus.

intumescence n. a swelling or an increase in the volume of an organ.

intussusception n. the telescoping (invagination) of one part of the bowel into another: most common in young children under the age of four. As the contents of the intestine are pushed onwards by muscular contraction more and more intestine is dragged into the invaginating portion, resulting in obstruction. Symptoms include intermittent screaming and pallor, vomiting, and the passing of bloody mucus (‘redcurrant jelly’) with the stools; if the condition does not receive prompt surgical treatment, shock from gangrene of the bowel may result. A barium or Gastrografin enema may confirm the diagnosis and in many cases may relieve the intussusception.

inulin n. a carbohydrate with a high molecular weight, used in a test of kidney function called inulin clearance. Inulin is filtered from the bloodstream by the kidneys. By injecting it into the blood and measuring the amount that appears in the urine over a given period, it is possible to calculate how much filtrate the kidneys are producing in a given time.

inunction n. the rubbing in with the fingers of an ointment or liniment.

invagination n. 1. the infolding of the wall of a solid structure to form a cavity. This occurs in some stages of the development of embryos. 2. see intussusception.

invasion n. the spread of *cancer into neighbouring normal structures; it is one of the cardinal features of malignancy.

inverse care law an ironic ‘law’ stating that where good health care is most needed, it is usually least available. It was first stated by the Welsh GP Tudor Hart to underline the great difficulty in bringing areas of health-care poverty up to acceptable levels. See health inequalities; justice; need; rationing.

inversion n. 1. the turning inwards or inside-out of a part or organ: commonly applied to the state of the uterus after childbirth when its upper part is pulled through the cervical canal. 2. a chromosome mutation in which a block of genes within a chromosome are in reverse order, due to that section of the chromosome becoming inverted. The centromere may be included in the inverted segment (pericentric inversion) or not (paracentric inversion).

invertebrate 1. n. an animal without a backbone. The following are invertebrate groups of medical importance: *insects, *ticks, *nematodes, *flukes, and *tapeworms. 2. adj. not possessing a backbone.

in vitro Latin: describing biological phenomena that are made to occur outside the living body (traditionally in a test-tube).

in vitro fertilization (IVF) fertilization of an ovum outside the body, the resultant *zygote being incubated to the *blastocyst stage and then implanted in the uterus. The technique, pioneered in Britain, resulted in 1978 in the birth of the first test-tube baby. IVF may be undertaken when a woman has blocked Fallopian tubes, unexplained infertility, endometriosis, or ovulation disorders; it is also carried out for purposes of surrogacy and egg donation. The mother-to-be is given hormone therapy causing a number of ova to mature at the same time (see superovulation). Several of them are then removed from the ovary through a laparoscope. The ova are mixed with spermatozoa and incubated in a culture medium until the blastocyst is formed. The blastocyst is then implanted in the mother’s uterus and the pregnancy proceeds normally. IVF is regulated by the *Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 via the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

in vivo Latin: describing biological phenomena that occur or are observed occurring within the bodies of living organisms.

involucrum n. a growth of new bone, formed from the *periosteum, that sometimes surrounds a mass of infected and dead bone in osteomyelitis.

involuntary muscle muscle that is not under conscious control, such as the muscle of the gut, stomach, blood vessels, and heart. See also cardiac muscle; smooth muscle.

involution n. 1. the shrinking of the uterus to its normal size after childbirth. 2. atrophy of the corpus luteum, which occurs after pregnancy or if implantation of the embryo does not occur. 3. atrophy of an organ in old age.

iodine n. an element required in small amounts for healthy growth and development. An adult body contains about 30 mg of iodine, mostly concentrated in the thyroid gland: this gland requires iodine to synthesize *thyroid hormones. A deficiency of iodine in adults leads to *goitre and in a fetus leads to *cretinism. The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 140 μg/day; dietary sources include seafood, vegetables grown in soil containing iodide, and iodized table salt. Iodine is used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the thyroid gland (see Lugol’s solution; radioactive iodine therapy) and also as an antiseptic and skin disinfectant (in the form of povidone-iodine). Water-soluble contrast media used in X-ray examinations are organic chemicals containing iodine, which is radiopaque due to its high atomic weight. Symbol: I.

iodism n. iodine poisoning. The main features are a characteristic staining of the mouth and odour on the breath. Vomited material may be yellowish or bluish. There is pain and burning in the throat, intense thirst, and diarrhoea, with dizziness, weakness, and convulsions. Emergency treatment includes administration of starch or flour in water and lavage with sodium thiosulphate solution.

IOL intraocular lens implant. See cataract.

ion n. an atom or group of atoms that has lost one or more electrons, making it electrically charged and therefore more chemically active. See anion; cation; electrolyte; ionization.

ion channel a protein that spans a cell membrane to form a water-filled pore through which ions (e.g. calcium [Ca2+], sodium [Na+], potassium [K+]) can pass into or out of the cell.

ionization n. the process of producing *ions. Some molecules ionize in solution (see electrolyte). Ions can also be produced when ionizing radiation dislodges one or more electrons from an atom or molecule. This can be harmful to DNA in cells, resulting in tumours or genetic defects.

iontophoresis n. the technique of introducing through the skin, by means of an electric current, charged particles of a drug, so that it reaches a deep site. The method has been used to transfer salicylate ions through the skin in the treatment of deep rheumatic pain. See also cataphoresis.

IOUS intraoperative ultrasound examination (see ultrasonography).

ipecacuanha n. a plant extract used in small doses, usually in the form of tinctures and syrups, as an *expectorant to relieve coughing and to induce vomiting. Ipecacuanha irritates the digestive system, and high doses may cause severe digestive upsets.

IPF see idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

ipilimumab n. a *monoclonal antibody that activates the immune system by blocking the normal inhibition of *cytotoxic T cells, which recognize and destroy cancer cells. It is used for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Side-effects include colitis, rash, and liver disorders.

ipratropium n. an *antimuscarinic drug used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of chronic reversible airways obstruction (see bronchospasm) and to relieve rhinorrhoea resulting from *rhinitis. Side-effects include dry mouth and nasal dryness.

ipsilateral (ipselateral, homolateral) adj. on or affecting the same side of the body: applied particularly to paralysis (or other symptoms) occurring on the same side of the body as the brain lesion that caused them. Compare contralateral.

IPSS see International Prostate Symptom Score.

IQ see intelligence quotient.

irbesartan n. see angiotensin II antagonist.

irid- (irido-) combining form denoting the iris.

iridectomy n. an operation on the eye in which a part of the iris is removed.

iridencleisis n. an operation for *glaucoma, now rarely performed, in which a small incision is made beneath the *conjunctiva close to the cornea and part of the iris is drawn into it.

iridodialysis n. a tear, caused by injury to the eye, in the attachment of the iris to the ciliary body. Usually a dark crescentic gap is seen at the edge of the iris where the tear has occurred, and the pupil pulls away from the site of the tear.

iridodonesis n. tremulousness of the iris seen when the eye is moved. It is due to absence of support from the lens, against which the iris normally lies, and occurs when the lens is absent or dislocated from its normal position.

iridoplegia n. paralysis of the iris, which is usually associated with *cycloplegia and results from injury, inflammation, or the use of pupil-dilating eye drops. In the case of injury, the pupil is usually larger than normal and moves little, if at all, in response to light and drugs.

iridotomy n. an operation on the eye in which a hole is made in the iris using a knife or a *YAG laser.

irinotecan n. see topoisomerase inhibitor.

iris n. the part of the eye that regulates the amount of light that enters. It forms a coloured muscular diaphragm across the front of the lens; light enters through a central opening, the pupil. A ring of muscle round the margin contracts in bright light, causing the pupil to become smaller (see pupillary reflex). In dim light a set of radiating muscles contract and the constricting muscles relax, increasing the size of the pupil. The outer margin of the iris is attached to the *ciliary body.

iris bombé an abnormal condition of the eye in which the iris bulges forward towards the cornea. It is due to pressure from the aqueous humour behind the iris when its passage through the pupil to the anterior chamber of the eye is blocked (pupil-block glaucoma).

The body of an adult contains on average 4 g of iron, over half of which is contained in *haemoglobin in the red blood cells, the rest being distributed between *myoglobin in muscles, *cytochromes and iron stores in the form of *ferritin and *haemosiderin. Iron is an essential component in the transfer of oxygen in the body, as well as a component of enzymes involved in the immune function. The absorption and loss of iron is very finely controlled. A good dietary source is meat, particularly liver. The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 10 mg per day for men and 12 mg per day for women during their reproductive life. A deficiency of iron may lead to *anaemia. Symbol: Fe.

Many preparations of iron are used to treat iron-deficiency anaemia. These include preparations taken by mouth, such as *ferrous sulphate, and those administered by injection, such as *iron dextran.

This has been found to be a major factor in patients’ dissatisfaction with their medical advisors.

irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) a common functional bowel disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, altered stool consistency, and variable frequency of defecation. The symptoms, which may differ from individual to individual, may be caused by abnormal contractions of the colon, heightened sensitivity to such stimuli as stretching or distension, stress, and changes in diet. A minority of people may develop symptoms following an episode of gastroenteritis (postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome). Tests may be needed to rule out organic disease. Treatment includes reassurance, dietary manipulation (see FODMAPS), the use of antispasmodics, antidiarrhoeal drugs or laxatives, and drugs that reduce the sensitivity of the bowel (such as low-dose amitriptyline).

irritable hip (transient synovitis of the hip) a self-limiting condition, affecting children between 3 and 10 years of age, due to inflammation of the synovium of the hip joint capsule.

islet cell antibodies a group of autoantibodies directed against components of the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. They are usually detectable in the blood of people presenting with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies against *glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in the beta cells have become a more specific test for islet cell antibodies, to help confirm a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

islet cell transplantation a new technique still under evaluation for curing type 1 *diabetes mellitus, which involves the injection of donated cells from the pancreatic *islets of Langerhans into the liver, where it is hoped they will seed and survive. The transplanted cells then take over insulin production from the recipient’s diseased pancreas.

isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH) n. a drug used in the treatment of *tuberculosis, usually taken by mouth. Because tuberculosis bacteria soon become resistant to isoniazid, it is given in conjunction with other antibiotics. Side-effects include peripheral neuropathy, especially in patients with diabetes or alcohol dependence, which can be countered by including pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in the preparation.

isophane insulins a group of insulins in which the insulin molecules are combined with *protamine molecules to slow down their rate of absorption from the injection site. The insulin is released steadily from the skin into the bloodstream to stabilize blood sugar over a longer period. Mixtures of isophane and fast-acting insulins are also available (biphasic insulin aspart, biphasic insulin lispro, biphasic isophane insulin).

isosorbide dinitrate a drug used for the prevention and treatment of angina; it acts by relaxing the smooth muscle of both arteries and veins, thus causing dilatation (see vasodilator). Side-effects include headache, flushing, dizziness, and hypotension.

isotonic exercises see exercise.

isotope n. any one of the different forms of an element, possessing the same number of protons (positively charged particles) in the nucleus, and thus the same atomic number, but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes therefore have different atomic weights. Radioactive isotopes decay into other isotopes or elements, emitting alpha, beta, or gamma radiation. Some radioactive isotopes may be produced artificially by bombarding elements with neutrons. These are known as nuclides and are used extensively in *radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer.

isotretinoin n. a drug related to vitamin A (see retinoid) that is administered orally in the treatment of severe acne that has failed to respond to other treatment and topically for mild to moderate acne. Possible side-effects include dry skin, nose bleeds, eyelid and lip inflammation, muscle, joint, and abdominal pains, fetal abnormalities (it should not be taken during pregnancy), diarrhoea, and some disturbances of vision.

isotropic adj. (in computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) denoting the acquisition of data when the slice thickness is similar in size to that of an individual *pixel in all planes, i.e. the *voxel is a cube.

ITU see intensive therapy unit.

IUCD (intrauterine contraceptive device) a plastic or metal coil, spiral, or other shape, about 25 mm long, that is inserted into the cavity of the uterus to prevent conception. Its exact mode of action is unknown but it is thought to interfere with implantation of the embryo. Early IUCDs (such as the Lippes loop) were made of plastic; later variants (such as the Gravigard) are covered with copper, which slowly dissolves and augments the contraceptive action. About one-third of women fitted with an IUCD find the side-effects (heavy menstrual bleeding or back pain) unacceptable, but most have no complaints. The unwanted pregnancy rate is about 2 per 100 woman-years. If pregnancy should occur there is normally no need to remove the device (it may, however, be shed spontaneously). See also IUS; postcoital contraception.

IUGR see intrauterine growth restriction.

IUI see intrauterine insemination.

IUS (intrauterine system) a hormonal contraceptive device consisting of a plastic T-shaped frame that is inserted into the uterus. It carries a progestogen (*levonorgestrel) in a sleeve around its stem and has two fine threads attached to its base, by which it can be removed. It provides a long-term method of contraception that is also reversible. The IUS is also used in the treatment of menorrhagia and benign *endometrial hyperplasia as it acts by thinning the endometrium. A newer version delivers a smaller amount of levonorgestrel and is suitable for young women who have not been pregnant; it is not licensed for menorrhagia or for use after the menopause.

IV intravenous. See infusion; injection.

ivermectin n. a drug used in the treatment of *onchocerciasis. It acts by killing the immature forms (*microfilariae) of the parasite. Ivermectin is also used to treat creeping eruption, strongyloidiasis, and scabies. Side-effects, which are mild, include itching and swollen lymph nodes.

The effect is transient and requires no treatment. [A. Jarisch (1850–1902), Austrian dermatologist; K. Herxheimer (1861–1944), German dermatologist]

jaundice n. a yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, indicating excess bilirubin (a bile pigment) in the blood. Jaundice is classified into three types. Obstructive jaundice occurs when bile made in the liver fails to reach the intestine due to obstruction of the *bile ducts (e.g. by gallstones or a tumour) or to *cholestasis. The urine becomes dark in colour and the stools become pale. Hepatocellular jaundice is due to disease of the liver cells, such as *hepatitis, when the liver is unable to utilize the bilirubin, which accumulates in the blood. The urine may be dark but the faeces retain their colour. Haemolytic jaundice occurs when there is excessive destruction of red cells in the blood (see haemolysis). Urine and faeces retain their normal colour. Medical name: icterus.

jaw n. either the *maxilla (upper jaw) or the *mandible (lower jaw). The jaws form the framework of the mouth and provide attachment for the teeth.

jaw-jerk reflex an abnormal reflex elicited by lightly placing the index finger across the chin of the patient and tapping it with a tendon hammer while the jaw hangs loosely open. A brisk upward movement of the jaw indicates an upper *motor neuron disorder above the brainstem.

jaw thrust a manoeuvre for opening the airway of an unconscious patient. The flats of the hands are placed on the cheeks with the fingers hooked under the angles of the jaw so that the jaw can be pulled upwards to separate the tongue from the back of the pharynx. The tongue often falls onto the back of the pharynx in unconsciousness, causing obstruction to the airway. This method is particularly useful when spinal injury is suspected and movement of the neck is undesirable. This is an alternative to the *head tilt, chin lift manoeuvre.

jaw wiring a radical but reversible approach to obtain weight loss in which the jaws are wired together surgically to restrict food intake to simple fluids. Success can be dramatic but weight is often regained once the restriction is removed and normal eating habits are resumed. See also bariatric surgery.

JE see junctional epithelium.

Jehovah’s Witnesses a religious movement important in medicine because of its biblical prohibition on using blood or blood products, even to save a life. Individual witnesses who undergo transfusion (even against their will or unknowingly) risk being seen by their community as defiled and damned for eternity. Physicians therefore may have to respond in critical circumstances to a competent adult’s decision to refuse treatment: there may be alternative nonbiological methods of treatment. An accident and emergency department should have a discussed and agreed policy, with senior staff available to help and counsel junior staff.

jejun- (jejuno-) combining form denoting the jejunum.

jejunal biopsy sampling of the mucosa in the jejunum. This is performed endoscopically using an *enteroscope, although a surgical approach may be considered.

jejunostomy n. a surgical operation in which the jejunum is brought through the abdominal wall as a *stoma. It may enable the insertion of a jejunal catheter for short-term infusion of nutrients or other substances. A feeding jejunostomy is a tube inserted into the jejunum using endoscopic or surgical techniques to allow the introduction of nutrients. This may be required when disease, previous surgery, or refractory vomiting prevents the placement of a *gastrostomy (PEG) tube. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) is a jejunal extension that is applied to an existing PEG tube.

jejunotomy n. surgical incision of the jejunum.

jejunum n. part of the small *intestine. It comprises about two-fifths of the whole small intestine and connects the duodenum to the ileum. —jejunal adj.

In electrical terms the joule is the work done per second when a current of 1 ampere flows through a resistance of 1 ohm. Symbol: J. See also calorie.

judgment n. the opinion of a clinician in the context of medical care. In spite of technical advances, few decisions in medicine are automatic. This is particularly true where there are critical differences of data interpretation, potential conflicts between individuals or family members, or moral and procedural dilemmas.

jugular adj. relating to or supplying the neck or throat.

jugular vein any one of several veins in the neck. The internal jugular is a very large paired vein running vertically down the side of the neck and draining blood from the brain, face, and neck. It ends behind the sternoclavicular joint, where it joins the subclavian vein. The external jugular is a smaller paired vein running superficially down the neck to the subclavian vein and draining blood from the face, scalp, and neck. Its tributary, the anterior jugular, runs down the front of the neck.

junctional epithelium (JE) (in dentistry) the stratified squamous *epithelium that is directly attached to the surface of a tooth; it has a protective function against periodontal diseases.

justice n. the moral requirement to treat people fairly and impartially and with a proper regard for their entitlements and deserts – although the ways in which ethicists and philosophers define fairness, entitlements, and deserts varies considerably. Justice is common to many theories of ethics and is one of the *four principles of medical ethics. Issues of justice are mainly, but not exclusively, concerned with the fair allocation of medical resources when these are limited, and can be encapsulated in theories of distributive justice (see desert; equality; need; rationing).

juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, Still’s disease) any one of a group of conditions characterized by inflammation of the joints lasting longer than 6 weeks and occurring before the age of 16. The causes are unknown but immunological and infective mechanisms are suspected. JIA can affect either four or fewer joints (pauciarticular JIA) or more than four (polyarticular JIA). There are two recognized types of pauciarticular JIA: type 1, which generally affects girls below the age of four; and type 2 (juvenile-onset spondylarthropathy), which generally affects boys over the age of nine. There are also two types of polyarticular JIA, depending on the presence or absence of a particular antibody in the blood. There is a great range of severity of these diseases. Treatment consists of pain management and prevention of subsequent deformity or limitation of movement (e.g. contractures). Long-term joint damage is prevented by use of medications similar to those used in rheumatoid arthritis.

juvenile-onset spondylarthropathy see juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

juvenile plantar dermatosis see dermatosis.

juvenile polyp see polyp.

juxta- combining form denoting proximity to. Example: juxta-articular (near a joint).

juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) a microscopic structure within the kidney that is important in regulating blood pressure, body fluid, and electrolytes. It is situated in each nephron, between the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. The JGA consists of specialized cells within the distal tubule (the macula densa), which detect the amount of sodium chloride passing through the tubule and can secrete locally acting vasoconstrictor substances that act on the associated afferent arteriole to induce a reduction in filtration pressure (tubuloglomerular feedback). Modified cells within the afferent arterioles secrete *renin in response to a fall in perfusion pressure or feedback from the macula densa and form a central role in the renin-*angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Mesangial cells support and connect the macula densa and the specialized cells in the afferent arteriole and have sympathetic innervation, facilitating the renin response to sympathetic nervous stimulation.

JVP see jugular venous pressure.

Kahn reaction a test for syphilis, in which antibodies specific to the disease are detected in a sample of the patient’s blood by means of a *precipitin reaction. This test is not as reliable as some. [R. L. Kahn (20th century), US bacteriologist]

kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis, Dumdum fever) n. a tropical disease caused by the parasitic protozoan *Leishmania donovani. The parasite, which is transmitted to humans by *sandflies, invades the cells of the lymphatic system, spleen, and bone marrow. Symptoms include enlargement and subsequent lesions of the liver and spleen; anaemia; a low *leucocyte count; weight loss; and irregular fevers. The disease occurs in Asia, South America, the Mediterranean area, and Africa. Drugs containing antimony, with supplementary pentamidine, are used in the treatment of this potentially fatal disease.

kallidin n. a naturally occurring polypeptide consisting of ten amino acids. Kallidin is a powerful vasodilator and causes contraction of smooth muscle; it is formed in the blood under certain conditions. See kinin.

Kallmann’s syndrome a familial condition that is the most common form of isolated *gonadotrophin deficiency; it is combined with underdevelopment of the olfactory lobes, causing *anosmia. The syndrome is caused by a gene *deletion on the short arm of the X chromosome. Patients often present with delayed puberty. There is an association with *ichthyosis, learning disabilities, obesity, renal and skeletal abnormalities, and undescended testes, but these features are very variable. [F. J. Kallmann (1897–1965), US geneticist]

Kantian ethics approaches to moral questions based on the thought of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). These seek to discover what is morally right by asking what basic rules all rational people (see autonomy) could adopt for themselves and then act on as an *imperative matter of *duty, regardless of their personal desires or of the possible consequences (see deontology; consequentialism). The Kantian tradition has been influential in medical ethics, especially in its insistence that every human life must be treated as an end in itself and not simply as a means.

kaolin n. a white clay that contains aluminium and silicon and is purified and powdered for use as an adsorbent. It may be used to treat chronic diarrhoea and is also used in dusting powders and poultices.

Kaposi’s sarcoma a malignant tumour arising from blood vessels in the skin and appearing as purple to dark brown plaques or nodules. It is common in Africa and is sometimes seen in those of Mediterranean extraction, but more commonly occurs in patients with *AIDS. The tumour evolves slowly; radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for localized lesions but chemotherapy may be of value in metastatic disease. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (see antiretroviral drug) should be started in those with HIV infection as a first-line treatment. [M. Kaposi (1837–1902), Hungarian dermatologist]

Kartagener’s syndrome a hereditary condition in which the heart and other internal organs lie on the opposite side of the body to the norm (i.e. the heart lies on the right; see dextrocardia); it is associated with chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis. [M. Kartagener (1897–1975), German physician]

katathermometer n. a thermometer used to measure the cooling power of the air surrounding it, having its bulb covered with water-moistened material. The instrument is brought to a steady temperature of 100°F and then exposed to the air. The time taken for the temperature recorded by the thermometer to fall to 95°F gives an index of the air’s cooling power.

Kawasaki disease (Kawasaki syndrome, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) a condition of unknown cause affecting young children, usually less than five years old and most commonly of Japanese or Korean descent, and characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, a sore throat, and a generalized rash and reddening of the palms and soles. This is followed by peeling of the fingers and toes. The fever usually persists for 1–2 weeks. In approximately one-fifth of children there is involvement of the coronary arteries and heart muscle (myocardium), resulting in *myocarditis and *aneurysms of the coronary arteries. About 2% of cases are fatal. The aneurysms will usually resolve spontaneously but slowly. Treatment involves aspirin therapy, and *gammaglobulin reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. [T. Kawasaki (20th century), Japanese physician]

Kayser–Fleischer ring a brownish-yellow ring in the outer rim of the cornea of the eye. It is a deposit of copper granules and is diagnostic of *Wilson’s disease. When well developed it can be seen by unaided observation, but faint Kayser-Fleischer rings may only be detected by specialized *slit-lamp ophthalmological examination. [B. Kayser (1869–1954), German ophthalmologist; B. Fleischer (1848–1904), German physician]

Kegel exercises (pelvic-floor muscle training, pelvic-floor exelrcises) active rehabilitation of the pelvic-floor muscles by conscious contractions, which leads to a cure in 50–80% of patients with stress incontinence. [A. H. Kegel (20th century), US gynaecologist]

Kehr’s sign pain in the left shoulder caused by irritation of the undersurface of the diaphragm by blood leaking from a ruptured spleen. The pain impulses are referred along the *phrenic nerve. [H. Kehr (1862–1913), German surgeon]

Kell antigens a group of antigens that may or may not be present on the surface of red blood cells, forming the basis of a *blood group. This group is important in blood transfusion reactions. [Mrs Kell (20th century), patient in whom they were first demonstrated]

Keller’s operation an operation for *hallux valgus (see also bunion) or *hallux rigidus that involves an excision *arthroplasty of the metatarsophalangeal joint, at the base of the big toe. The toe will be slightly shorter and floppy, but usually this improves alignment and range of movement. [W. L. Keller (1874–1959), US surgeon]

keloid n. an overgrowth of fibrous scar tissue following trauma to the skin. It does not resolve spontaneously but may be flattened by silicone gels, applied pressure, injections of potent corticosteroids, or intralesional excision (or combinations of these). Keloid formation is particularly common at certain sites, such as the breastbone or ear lobe; surgical excision of benign (nonmalignant) lesions from such sites is therefore best avoided. See also scar.

kelvin n. the *SI unit of temperature, formally defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water. A temperature in kelvins is equal to a Celsius temperature plus 273.15°C. Symbol: K.

Kemp echoes see otoacoustic emissions.

kerat- (kerato-) combining form denoting 1. the cornea. Example: keratopathy (disease of). 2. horny tissue, especially of the skin.

keratalgia n. pain arising from the cornea.

keratectasia n. bulging of the cornea at the site of scar tissue (which is thinner than normal corneal tissue).

keratectomy n. an operation in which a part of the cornea is removed, usually a superficial layer. This procedure is now frequently done by an *excimer laser, either to correct refractive errors (myopia, hypermetropia), by reshaping the surface of the cornea (photorefractive keratectomy; PRK), or to remove diseased corneal tissue (phototherapeutic keratectomy). See also automated lamellar keratectomy.

keratin n. one of a family of proteins that are the major constituents of the nails, hair, and the outermost layers of the skin. The cytoplasm of epithelial cells, including *keratinocytes, contains a network of keratin filaments.

keratinization (cornification) n. the process by which cells become horny due to the deposition of *keratin within them. It occurs in the *epidermis of the skin and associated structures (hair, nails, etc.), where the cells become flattened, lose their nuclei, and are filled with keratin as they approach the surface.

keratinocyte n. a type of cell that makes up 95% of the cells of the epidermis. Keratinocytes migrate from the deeper layers of the epidermis and are finally shed from the surface of the skin.

keratitis n. inflammation of the *cornea of the eye. It may be due to physical or chemical agents (abrasions, exposure to dust, chemicals, ultraviolet light, etc.) or result from infection. The eye waters and is very painful, and vision is blurred. In disciform keratitis a disc-shaped patch of oedema and inflammation develops in the cornea, usually as an immune response to viral infection, commonly herpes simplex. Filamentary keratitis is associated with small mucoid deposits of epithelial filaments on the surface of the cornea, which come off to leave small corneal erosions that cause severe pain until they heal.

keratoacanthoma n. a firm nodule that appears singly on the skin, grows to 1–2 cm across in about 6 weeks, and usually disappears gradually during the next few months. Men are affected more often than women, commonly between the ages of 50 and 70. Keratoacanthomas occur mainly on the face; the cause is not known. Spontaneous healing may leave an unsightly scar; therefore treatment by curettage and cautery, or excision, may be required. The precise relationship of keratoacanthoma to *squamous cell carcinoma is controversial.

keratocele (descemetocele) n. outward bulging of the base of a deep ulcer of the cornea. The deep layer of the cornea (Descemet’s membrane) is elastic and relatively resistant to perforation; it therefore bulges when the overlying cornea has been destroyed.

keratoconjunctivitis n. combined inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva due to deficient production of tears. It may be associated with systemic disorders, such as *Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and sarcoidosis.

keratoconus n. conical cornea: a slowly progressive abnormality in the cornea, which changes from its normal gradual curve to a more conical shape, causing distortion of vision.

keratocyte (fibroblast) n. a cell, derived from *mesenchyme, of the corneal *stroma. Such cells are normally quiescent but can readily respond to injury and change into repair types.

keratoglobus (megalocornea) n. a congenital disorder of the eye in which the whole cornea bulges forward in a regular curve. Compare keratoconus.

keratomalacia n. a progressive nutritional disease of the eye due to *vitamin A deficiency. The cornea softens and may even perforate. This condition is very serious and blindness is usually inevitable. See also xerophthalmia.

keratome n. any instrument designed for cutting the cornea. The simplest type has a flat triangular blade attached at its base to a handle, the other two sides being very sharp and tapering to a point. Power-driven keratomes have oscillating or rotating blades. An automated keratome is used in *automated lamellar keratectomy. See also microkeratome.

keratometer (ophthalmometer) n. an instrument for measuring the radius of curvature of the cornea. Usually the vertical and horizontal curvatures are measured. All keratometers work on the principle that the size of the image of an object reflected from a convex mirror (in this case, the cornea) depends on the curvature of the mirror. The steeper the curve, the smaller the image. The keratometer is used for assessing the degree of curvature of the cornea in different meridians. —keratometry n.

keratomileusis n. see intrastromal keratomileusis; LASIK.

keratopathy n. any disorder relating to the cornea. See band keratopathy; bullous keratopathy.

keratoplasty (corneal graft) n. an eye operation in which any diseased part of the cornea is replaced by clear corneal tissue from a donor. In penetrating keratoplasty all layers of the cornea are replaced, in lamellar keratoplasty only the superficial layers are replaced, and in Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) the endothelium only is replaced.

keratoprosthesis n. an optically clear prosthesis that is implanted into the cornea to replace an area that has become opaque. Due to its poor success rate, it is used only as a last resort in an attempt to restore some sight to patients with severe disease where corneal transplantation (see keratoplasty) is unlikely to succeed.

keratoscope (Placido’s disc) n. an instrument for detecting abnormal curvature of the cornea. It consists of a black disc, about 20 cm in diameter, marked with concentric white rings. The examiner looks through a small lens in the centre at the reflection of the rings in the patient’s cornea. A normal cornea will reflect regular concentric images of the rings; a cornea that is abnormally curved (for example in *keratoconus) or scarred reflects distorted rings. Modern keratoscopes can print out a contour map of the corneal surface.

keratosis n. a horny overgrowth of the skin. Actinic (or solar) keratoses are red spots with a scaly surface, found in older fair-skinned people who have been chronically overexposed to the sun. They may occasionally become a *squamous cell carcinoma. Seborrhoeic keratoses (also known as seborrhoeic warts) never become malignant. They are superficial yellowish or brown spots, crusty or greasy-looking, occurring especially on the trunk in middle age, that become warty over the years.

keratosis obturans an abnormal build-up of *keratin and dead skin cells within the ear canal that can block the canal, cause conductive hearing loss (see deafness), and erode the bone of the ear canal. It is associated with *bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis.

keratosis pilaris (follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris) a very common autosomal *dominant condition characterized by rough horny plugs in the hair follicles, usually on the skin of the lateral and posterior aspects of the arms. They may be skin-coloured, red, or brown. The condition typically appears during teenage years and persists into adulthood; it is completely harmless.

keratotomy n. an incision into the cornea. See arcuate keratotomy; radial keratotomy.

keratouveitis n. inflammation involving both the cornea (see keratitis) and the uvea (see uveitis).

kerion n. an uncommon and severe form of *ringworm of the scalp consisting of a painful inflamed mass. It is caused by a type of fungus (e.g. Trichophyton tonsurans).

Kerley B lines fine horizontal lines seen in the angle between the diaphragm and the chest wall on a chest X-ray. It is a sign of pulmonary *oedema and therefore heart failure. [P. J. Kerley (20th century), British radiologist]

kernicterus n. staining and subsequent damage of the brain by bile pigment (bilirubin), which may occur in severe cases of *haemolytic disease of the newborn. Immature brain cells in the *basal ganglia are affected, and as brain development proceeds a pattern of *cerebral palsy emerges at about six months, with uncoordinated movements, deafness, disturbed vision, and feeding and speech difficulties.

Kernig’s sign a symptom of *meningitis in which the hamstring muscles in the legs are so stiff that the patient is unable to extend his legs at the knee when the thighs are held at a right angle to the body. [V. Kernig (1840–1917), Russian physician]

Kernohan’s phenomenon (Kernohan’s syndrome) *hemiplegia that is *ipsilateral to the brain lesion that caused it, due to pressure of the lesion (which is often a haematoma) on surrounding structures in the brain. It is unusual because normally a lesion of the brain causes dysfunction in the *contralateral limbs. [J. W. K. Kernohan (20th century), US pathologist]

ketoacidosis n. a condition in which *acidosis is accompanied by *ketosis, such as occurs in diabetes mellitus (see diabetic ketoacidosis). Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, abdominal tenderness, confusion or coma, extreme thirst, and weight loss.

ketoconazole n. an antifungal drug (see imidazole) applied topically to treat fungal infections of the skin and anogenital region.

ketogenesis n. the production of *ketone bodies. These are normal products of lipid metabolism and can be used to provide energy. The condition of *ketosis can occur when excess ketone bodies are produced.

ketogenic diet a diet that promotes the formation of *ketone bodies in the tissues. A ketogenic diet is one in which the principal energy source is fat rather than carbohydrate. Its adoption can help control epileptic seizures.

ketonaemia n. the presence in the blood of *ketone bodies.

ketone n. any member of a group of organic compounds consisting of a carbonyl group (=CO) flanked by two alkyl groups. The ketones acetoacetic acid, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate (known as ketone (or acetone) bodies) are produced during the metabolism of fats. See also ketosis.

ketonuria (acetonuria) n. the presence in the urine of *ketone (acetone) bodies. This may occur in diabetes mellitus, starvation, or after persistent vomiting and results from the partial oxidation of fats. Ketone bodies may be detected by adding a few drops of 5% sodium nitroprusside solution and a solution of ammonia to the urine; the gradual development of a purplish-red colour indicates their presence.

ketoprofen n. an anti-inflammatory drug (see NSAID) used to treat various arthritic and rheumatic diseases and to relieve pain. Gastric bleeding and ulceration may occur.

ketose n. a simple sugar that terminates with a keto group (−C=O); for example, *fructose.

ketosis n. raised levels of *ketone bodies in the body tissues. Ketone bodies are normal products of fat metabolism and can be oxidized to produce energy. Elevated levels arise when there is an imbalance in fat metabolism, such as occurs in diabetes mellitus or starvation. Ketosis may result in severe *acidosis. See also ketonuria.

keV symbol for kiloelectronvolt. See electronvolt.

keyhole surgery see minimally invasive surgery.

khat (qat, kat) n. the leaves of the shrub Catha edulis, which contain a stimulant. In Yemen these leaves are wrapped around betel nuts and chewed: this habit is associated with the development of oral *leukoplakia. In 2014 khat became a class-C drug in the UK owing to its increasing use. Possession of the drug can result in up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.

kidney n. either of the pair of organs responsible for the excretion of nitrogenous wastes, principally urea, from the blood (see illustrations). The kidneys are situated at the back of the abdomen, below the diaphragm, one on each side of the spine; they are supplied with blood by the renal arteries. Each kidney is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and is composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The active units of the kidney are the *nephrons, within the cortex and medulla, which filter the blood under pressure and then reabsorb water and selected substances back into the blood. The *urine thus formed is conducted from the nephrons via the renal tubules into the renal pelvis and from here to the ureter, which leads to the bladder. See also haemodialysis; horseshoe kidney; renal function tests.

Potentially dangerous, when carefully used under regional anaesthesia they can achieve a controlled atraumatic delivery. [C. Kielland (20th century), Norwegian obstetrician]

Kienböck’s disease necrosis of the *lunate bone of the wrist caused by interruption of its blood supply (see osteochondritis; osteonecrosis). It usually follows chronic stress or injury to the wrist and presents with pain and stiffness, with reduced grip strength. Initially, X-rays may show no abnormality; if the disease is suspected, a bone scan or MRI is indicated. Treatment is with rest, splintage, and *NSAIDs, but some cases require surgical shortening of the radius or *arthrodesis of the wrist. [R. Kienböck (1871–1953), Austrian radiologist]

Kiesselbach’s plexus a collection of capillaries in the mucosa at the anterior part of the nasal septum. Nosebleeds frequently have their origin from this plexus. See epistaxis; Little’s area. [W. Kiesselbach (1839–1902), German laryngologist]

kilocalorie n. one thousand calories. See calorie.

kilogram n. the *SI unit of mass equal to 1000 grams and previously defined in terms of the international prototype kept at Sèvres, near Paris; from 20 May 2019 it is defined in terms of the Planck constant. Symbol: kg.

kilovolt n. one thousand *volts (symbol: kV). In radiography, the kilovoltage of the X-ray machine determines the maximum energy of the X-rays produced. The setting is important in controlling the exposure of the film and is generally higher when more penetration is required, depending on the thickness of the body part being imaged. See also milliamp.

Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesion n. a nodular form of glomerulosclerosis associated with diabetic nephropathy. See also diabetic glomerulosclerosis. [P. Kimmelstiel and C. Wilson (20th century), US physicians]

kin- (kine-) combining form denoting movement.

kinaesthesia n. the sense that enables the brain to be constantly aware of the position and movement of muscles in different parts of the body. This is achieved by means of *proprioceptors, which send impulses from muscles, joints, and tendons. Without this sense, coordinated movement would be impossible with the eyes closed.

kinaesthesiometer n. an instrument for measuring a patient’s awareness of the muscular and joint movements of his own body: used during the investigation of nervous and muscular disorders and certain forms of brain damage.

-kinesis combining form denoting movement.

kinetochore n. see centromere.

King–Kopetzky syndrome see obscure auditory dysfunction.

kinin n. one of a group of naturally occurring polypeptides that are powerful *vasodilators, which lower blood pressure, and cause contraction of smooth muscle. The kinins bradykinin and kallidin are formed in the blood by the action of proteolytic enzymes (kallikreins) on certain plasma globulins (kininogens). Kinins are not normally present in the blood, but are formed under certain conditions; for example when tissue is damaged or when there are changes in the pH and temperature of the blood. They are thought to play a role in inflammatory response.

KIRs killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, which are present on the surface of *natural killer cells.

kiss of life see mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

kisspeptin n. a protein that appears to have an important role in initiating secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) at puberty.

Kleine–Levin syndrome a rare episodic disorder characterized by periods (usually of a few days or weeks), in which sufferers eat enormously, sleep for most of the day and night, and may become more dependent or aggressive than normal. Between episodes they are usually quite unaffected. The disorder almost always resolves spontaneously. [W. Kleine (20th century), German neuropsychiatrist; M. Levin (20th century), US neurologist]

klepto- combining form denoting stealing.

kleptomania n. a pathologically strong impulse to steal, often in the absence of any desire for the stolen object(s).

Affected individuals are apparently male, but are tall and thin, with small testes, failure of normal sperm production (azoospermia), enlargement of the breasts (gynaecomastia), and absence of facial and body hair. [H. F. Klinefelter (1912–90), US physician]

Klumpke’s paralysis a partial paralysis of the arm caused by injury to a baby’s *brachial plexus during birth. This may result from an obstetric manoeuvre in which the arm is raised at the shoulder to an extreme degree, which damages the lower cervical (neck) and upper thoracic (chest) nerve roots of the spinal cord. It results in weakness and wasting of the muscles of the hand. [A. Klumpke (1859–1927), French neurologist]

koro n. a state of acute anxiety, seen especially in certain cultures (such as that of the Chinese of SE Asia), characterized by a sudden belief that the penis is shrinking into the abdomen and will disappear: the sufferer is often convinced that disappearance of the penis means death. Occasionally women have a similar belief that their breasts are disappearing into their body. It is usually treated with tranquillizing drugs and reassurance.

Korsakoff’s syndrome an organic disorder affecting the brain that results in a memory defect in which new information fails to be learnt although events from the past are still recalled; *disorientation in time and place; and a tendency to unintentionally invent material to fill memory blanks (see confabulation). The commonest cause of the condition is untreated *Wernicke’s encephalopathy in the context of alcoholism. Large doses of thiamine are given as treatment. The condition often becomes chronic. [S. S. Korsakoff (1854–1900), Russian neurologist]

Kostmann’s syndrome (severe congenital neutropenia) a hereditary (autosomal *recessive) disorder characterized by severe *neutropenia. This results in frequent bacterial infections, and death often occurs before the age of six months.

kraurosis n. shrinking of a body part, usually the vulva in elderly women (kraurosis vulvae).

Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) a complex cycle of enzyme-catalysed reactions, occurring within the cells of all living animals, in which acetate, in the presence of oxygen, is broken down to produce energy in the form of *ATP (via the *electron transport chain) and carbon dioxide. The cycle is the final step in the oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; some of the intermediary products of the cycle are used in the synthesis of amino acids. [Sir H. A. Krebs (1900–81), British biochemist]

Krukenberg’s spindle a vertical linear deposit of brown pigment on the inner surface of the cornea (corneal endothelium), appearing in cases of pigment dispersion syndrome. [F. E. Krukenberg (1871–1946), German pathologist]

Muscular control becomes defective and shiver-like tremors occur in the trunk, limbs, and head. Death usually occurs within 9–12 months. Thought to be caused by a *prion and transmitted by cannibalism, kuru was largely limited to the Fore tribe of New Guinea and mainly affected women and children, reaching high levels in the mid-20th century. It has died out since cannibalism is no longer practised. See also spongiform encephalopathy.

Kussmaul breathing the slow deep respiration associated with acidosis. [A. Kussmaul (1822–1902), German physician]

kV symbol for *kilovolt.

Kveim test a test used for the diagnosis of *sarcoidosis. Tissue from a lymph node of a person suffering from the disease is injected intradermally; the development of a granuloma at the injection site indicates that the subject has sarcoidosis. [M. A. Kveim (20th century), Norwegian physician]

kwashiorkor n. a form of malnutrition due to a diet deficient in protein and energy-producing foods, common among certain African tribes. Kwashiorkor develops when, after prolonged breast feeding, the child is weaned onto an inadequate traditional family diet. The diet is such that it is physically impossible for the child to consume the required quantity in order to obtain sufficient protein and energy. Kwashiorkor is most common in children between the ages of one and three years. The symptoms are *oedema, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, general discomfort, and apathy; the child fails to thrive and there is usually associated gastrointestinal infection.

Kyasanur Forest disease a tropical disease, common in southern India, caused by a virus transmitted to humans through the bite of the forest-dwelling tick Haemaphysalis spinigera. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscular pains, vomiting, conjunctivitis, exhaustion, bleeding of nose and gums and, subsequently, internal bleeding and the *necrosis of various tissues. General therapy, in the absence of specific treatment, involves relief of dehydration and loss of blood; analgesics are given to alleviate pain.

kymograph n. an instrument for recording the flow and varying pressure of the blood within the blood vessels. —kymography n.

kypho- combining form denoting a hump.

kyphoplasty n. (in interventional radiology) a technique in which a collapsed high-tensile balloon is inserted into a fractured vertebra (a compression fracture) through a large-bore needle and inflated to restore the height of the vertebra. The balloon is then removed and the space is filled with bone cement.

kyphos n. a sharp posterior angulation of the spine due to localized collapse or wedging of one or more vertebrae. It results in the appearance of a hump on the back (a hunchback deformity). The cause may be a congenital defect, a fracture (which may or may not be pathological), or spinal tuberculosis.

kyphoscoliosis n. abnormal posterior and sideways curvature of the spine, i.e. *kyphosis combined with *scoliosis. The deformity may occur during growth for no apparent reason (idiopathic kyphoscoliosis) or may result from any of several diseases involving the vertebrae and spinal muscles. Special braces can reduce the extent of the deformity if this is mild. Severe deformity may require surgical correction by *fusion of the spine.

kyphosis n. outward curvature of the spine, which if excessive causes hunching of the back. A mobile kyphosis may be caused by bad posture or muscle weakness or may develop to compensate for another condition, such as hip deformity; it can be corrected by backward bending. A fixed kyphosis may be congenital; it may arise in adolescence (see Scheuermann’s disease); or it may result from collapse of the vertebrae, as in *osteoporosis, ankylosing *spondylitis, infections, or tumours. Treatment depends on the cause and may include physiotherapy, bracing, and surgery (spinal *osteotomy and fusion may be required in severe cases). See also kyphos; kyphoscoliosis.





l

labium n. (pl. labia) a lip-shaped structure, especially either of the two pairs of skin folds that enclose the *vulva. The larger outer pair are known as the labia majora and the smaller inner pair the labia minora.

labour n. the sequence of actions by which a baby and the afterbirth (placenta) are expelled from the uterus at childbirth. The process usually starts spontaneously about 280 days after conception, but it may be started by artificial means (see induction). In the first stage the muscular wall of the uterus begins contracting while the muscle fibres of the cervix relax so that the cervix expands. A portion of the membranous sac (amnion) surrounding the baby is pushed into the opening and ruptures under the pressure, releasing *amniotic fluid to the exterior. In the second stage the baby’s head appears at the cervix and the contractions of the uterus strengthen. The passage of the infant through the vagina is assisted by contractions of the abdominal muscles and conscious pushing by the mother. When the top of the baby’s head appears at the vaginal opening the whole infant is eased clear of the vagina, and the umbilical cord is cut. If the emergence of the head is impeded an incision may be made in the surrounding tissue (see episiotomy). In the final stage the placenta and membranes are pushed out by the continuing contraction of the uterus, which eventually returns to its unexpanded state. The average duration of labour is about 12 hours in first pregnancies and about 8 hours in subsequent pregnancies. The pain of labour may be reduced with effective birth preparation, continuous midwifery support in labour, and by the use of drugs (e.g. morphine, epidural anaesthesia). See also Caesarean section.

labrum n. (pl. labra) a lip or liplike structure; occurring, for example, around the margins of the articulating socket (acetabulum) of the hip bone.

labyrinth (inner ear) n. a convoluted system of cavities and ducts comprising the organs of hearing and balance. The membranous labyrinth is a series of interconnected membranous canals and chambers consisting of the *semicircular canals, *utricle, and *saccule (concerned with balance) and the central cavity of the *cochlea (concerned with hearing). (See illustration.) It is filled with a fluid, endolymph. The bony labyrinth is the system of the bony canals and chambers that surround the membranous labyrinth. It is embedded in the petrous part of the *temporal bone and is filled with fluid (perilymph).

Labyrinth. Membranous labyrinth of the right ear.





labyrinthectomy n. a surgical procedure to ablate (see ablation) the structures of the *labyrinth, usually performed for cases of severe Ménière’s disease.

labyrinthitis (otitis interna) n. inflammation of the inner ear (labyrinth) resulting in dizziness, vertigo, and hearing loss (compare vestibular neuronitis). A form of *otitis, it may be caused by bacterial or viral infections but often the cause is unknown.

laceration n. a tear in the flesh caused by a blunt object producing a wound with irregular edges. A *gunshot wound is an example of a laceration caused by a high-velocity blunt object.

lacertus n. a band of fibres or a tendon-like structure.

lacrimal apparatus the structures that produce and drain away fluid from the eye (see illustration). The lacrimal gland secretes *tears, which drain away through small openings (puncta) at the inner corner of the eye into two lacrimal canaliculi. From there the tears pass into the nasal cavity via the lacrimal sac and the *nasolacrimal duct.

The lacrimal apparatus of the left eye.





lacrimal bone the smallest bone of the face: either of a pair of rectangular bones that contribute to the orbits. See skull.

lacrimal nerve a branch of the *ophthalmic nerve that supplies the lacrimal gland (see lacrimal apparatus) and conjunctiva.

lact- (lacti-, lacto-) combining form denoting 1. milk. 2. lactic acid.

lactalbumin n. a milk protein present in milk at a lower concentration than *casein. Unlike casein, it is not precipitated from milk under acid conditions; it is therefore a constituent of cheese made from whey rather than curd.

lactase n. an enzyme, secreted by the glands of the small intestine, that converts lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose during digestion.

lactation n. the secretion of milk by the *mammary glands of the breasts, which begins normally at the end of pregnancy or may be pathological (see galactorrhoea). A fluid called *colostrum is secreted before the milk is produced; both secretions are released in response to the sucking action of the infant on the nipple. Lactation is controlled by hormones (see prolactin; oxytocin); it stops when the baby is no longer fed at the breast.

lacteal n. a blind-ended lymphatic vessel that extends into a villus of the small *intestine. Digested fats are absorbed into the lacteals.

lactic acid a compound that forms in the cells as the end-product of glucose metabolism in the absence of oxygen (see glycolysis). During strenuous exercise pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid, which may accumulate in the muscles and cause cramp. Lactic acid (owing to its low pH) is an important food preservative. The lactic acid produced by the fermentation of milk is responsible for the preservation and flavour of cheese, yoghurt, and other fermented milk products.

lactic acidosis excessive plasma acidity due to an accumulation of lactic acid. This may be caused by a variety of illnesses, including heart failure or severe dehydration. It can also be caused by the accumulation of *biguanide drugs used for treating type 2 *diabetes mellitus, particularly when kidney failure is present. Biguanides (see metformin) should therefore not be used to treat patients who have established kidney disease or heart failure or who are dehydrated.

lactiferous adj. transporting or secreting milk, as the lactiferous ducts of the breast.

lactifuge n. a drug that reduces the secretion of milk. Some oestrogenic drugs have this effect and are used to suppress milk production in mothers not breastfeeding.

Lactobacillus n. a genus of Gram-positive nonmotile rodlike bacteria capable of growth in acid media and of producing lactic acid from the fermentation of carbohydrates. They are found in fermenting animal and plant products, especially dairy products, and in the alimentary tract and vagina. They are responsible for the souring of milk. The species L. acidophilus is found in milk and is associated with dental caries. It occurs in very high numbers in the faeces of breast- or bottle-fed infants.

lactogenic hormone see prolactin.

lactose n. a sugar, consisting of one molecule of glucose and one of galactose, found only in milk. Lactose is split into its constituent sugars by the enzyme *lactase, which is secreted in the small intestine. This enzyme is missing or is of low activity in certain people of some Eastern and African races. This leads to the inability to absorb lactose, known as lactose intolerance.

lactosuria n. the presence of milk sugar (*lactose) in the urine. This often occurs during pregnancy and breastfeeding or if the milk flow is suppressed.

lactulose n. a disaccharide sugar that acts as a gentle but effective osmotic *laxative. It is administered by mouth but is not absorbed or broken down, remaining intact until it reaches the colon. There it is split by bacteria into simpler sugars that help to retain water, thereby softening the stools. Lactulose is also used as a bowel cleanser for treating *hepatic encephalopathy.

lacuna n. (pl. lacunae) 1. (in anatomy) a small cavity or depression; for example, one of the spaces in compact bone in which a bone cell lies. 2. (in ethics) a crucial gap, for instance in laying out the arguments for or against a controversial approach or treatment, that may invalidate the whole approach.

laetrile n. a cyanide-containing compound extracted from peach stones. It has been used in *complementary medicine in the treatment of various forms of cancer.

laminaria n. an osmotic dilator applied to the cervix before surgically induced abortion in the second trimester (15–23 weeks of pregnancy). Pretreatment with prostaglandins can also be used, but laminaria is preferred after 18 weeks gestation in order to avoid trauma to the cervix and uterus.

laminectomy n. surgical cutting into the backbone to obtain access to the vertebral (spinal) canal. The surgeon excises the rear part (the posterior arch) of one or more vertebrae. The operation is performed to remove tumours, to treat injuries to the spine, such as prolapsed intervertebral (slipped) disc (in which the affected disc is removed), or to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or roots.

lancet n. a broad two-edged surgical knife with a sharp point.

lancinating adj. describing a sharp stabbing or cutting pain.

Landau reflex a reflex seen in normal babies from three months until one year, when it disappears. If the baby is held horizontally, face down, it will straighten its legs and back and try to lift up its head. The presence of this reflex beyond one year may be suggestive of a developmental disorder.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis overgrowth of cells of the *reticuloendothelial system. This includes disorders previously called histiocytosis X, including eosinophilic granuloma, Hand–Schüller–Christian disease, and Letterer–Siwe disease. [P. Langerhans (1847–88), German physician and anatomist]

laparo- combining form denoting the loins or abdomen.

laparoscope (peritoneoscope) n. a surgical instrument (a type of *endoscope) comprising an illuminated viewing tube generally connected to a camera, with the image viewed on a video screen. It is inserted through the abdominal wall to enable the surgeon to view the abdominal organs (see laparoscopy). It can be used as a means to allow surgical procedures to be carried out with special instruments, through several small skin incisions. See also minimally invasive surgery.

laparoscopic myolysis see fibroid.

laparoscopy (peritoneoscopy) n. examination of the abdominal structures (which are contained within the peritoneum) by means of a *laparoscope. This is passed through a small incision in the wall of the abdomen after insufflating carbon dioxide into the abdominal cavity (creating a *pneumoperitoneum). Laparoscopy enables visual assessment of abdominal organs, harvesting of biopsies, and cancer staging. Therapeutic uses include aspiration of cysts, division of adhesions, and surgery that would previously have required *laparotomy. Examples include *hysterectomy, *cholecystectomy, *fundoplication, *prostatectomy, *colectomy, *nephrectomy, *oophorectomy, Fallopian tube ligation, and ova collection for *in vitro fertilization. See also minimally invasive surgery. —laparoscopic adj.

Lariam n. see mefloquine.

larva n. (pl. larvae) the preadult or immature stage hatching from the egg of some animal groups, e.g. insects and nematodes, which may be markedly different from the sexually mature adult and have a totally different way of life. For example, the larvae of some flies are parasites of animals and cause disease whereas the adults are free-living. —larval adj.

larva migrans see creeping eruption.

laryng- (laryngo-) combining form denoting the larynx.

laryngeal mask an airway tube with an elliptical inflatable cuff at one end for insertion into the mouth of a patient requiring artificial ventilation. It is designed to fit snugly in the patient’s throat over the top of the laryngeal opening. While it is relatively easy to insert and allows delivery of effective artificial ventilation, it does not provide the absolute protection of the airway from vomitus afforded by an endotracheal tube (see intubation).

laryngeal reflex a cough produced by irritating the larynx.

laryngeal stroboscopy a method of studying the movements of the *vocal folds of the *larynx by using stroboscopic light (controlled intermittent flashes) to slow or freeze the movement.

laryngectomy n. surgical removal of the larynx in the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma. Postoperatively the patient breathes through a *tracheostomy. Speech is lost following the operation but can be restored by teaching the patient to swallow air and then belch it in a controlled fashion. Alternatively, a battery-powered vibrating device can be held in the mouth or underneath the chin to produce speech (see electrolarynx). Speech can also be facilitated by a one-way valve surgically implanted between the tracheostomy and the upper oesophagus, allowing the patient to divert air into the throat. Partial laryngectomy conserves part of the larynx and allows patients to breathe and speak normally. However, it is only suitable for a few patients with small tumours.

laryngismus n. closure of the vocal folds by sudden contraction of the laryngeal muscles, followed by a noisy indrawing of breath. It occurs in young children and was in the past associated with low-calcium rickets. Now it occurs when the larynx has been irritated following administration of anaesthetic, when a foreign body has lodged in the larynx, or in *croup.

laryngitis n. inflammation of the larynx and vocal folds, due to infection by bacteria or viruses or irritation by gases, chemicals, etc. The folds lose their vibrance (owing to swelling) and the voice becomes husky or is lost completely; breathing is harsh and difficult (see stridor); and the cough is painful and honking. Obstruction of the airways may occasionally be serious, especially in children (see croup). The patient should rest his voice and remain in a warm moisture-laden atmosphere; steam inhalations for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours are traditionally beneficial.

laryngocele n. a condition in which an air sac communicates with the larynx. The sac forms a swelling in the neck that dilates on coughing or straining. The condition is probably congenital but is also noted in such people as glassblowers, who have chronically raised intralaryngeal pressure.

laryngofissure n. a surgical operation to open the larynx, enabling access for further procedures.

laryngology n. the study of diseases of the larynx and vocal folds.

laryngomalacia n. a condition characterized by paroxysmal attacks of breathing difficulty and *stridor. It occurs in small children and is caused by flaccidity of the structure of the larynx. It usually resolves spontaneously by the age of two years.

laryngopharynx n. see hypopharynx.

laryngoscope n. a device used to inspect the larynx. This can be for diagnostic purposes, to facilitate surgery on the laryngeal structures, or to aid insertion of an endotracheal tube (see intubation). Diagnostic laryngoscopes for use on awake patients are generally fibreoptic devices that are introduced through the mouth or nose. Surgical laryngoscopes are hollow tubes that are passed through the mouth and pharynx and are often used in conjunction with an *operating microscope. Intubating or anaesthetic laryngoscopes consist of a handle and a curved blade, fitted with a light, for moving the tongue and epiglottis aside.

laryngoscopy n. examination of the larynx. This may be done indirectly using a small mirror or directly using a *laryngoscope.

laryngospasm n. involuntary closure of the larynx, obstructing the flow of air to the lungs.

laryngotomy n. surgical incision of the larynx. See cricothyroidotomy.

laryngotracheobronchitis n. a severe and almost exclusively viral infection of the respiratory tract, especially of young children, in whom there may be a dangerous degree of obstruction either at the larynx (see croup) or main air passages (bronchi) due to the thickness and stickiness of the fluid (exudate) produced by the inflamed tissues. Symptoms normally start at night. Treatment is supportive until the condition resolves naturally. In mild and moderate cases the child may benefit from being kept in a humid atmosphere (e.g. a steamy room). Nebulized medications and oxygen can help in more severe cases. In extreme cases endotracheal *intubation may be necessary. The condition may recur.

laryngotracheoplasty n. a surgical procedure to enlarge the airway within the larynx and upper trachea. It is most commonly used in children with narrowing of the larynx below the vocal folds (subglottic stenosis).

larynx n. the organ responsible for the production of vocal sounds, also serving as an air passage conveying air from the pharynx to the lungs. It is situated in the front of the neck, above the trachea. It is made up of a framework of nine cartilages (see illustration) – the epiglottis, thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid (two), corniculate (two), and cuneiform (two) – bound together by ligaments and muscles and lined with mucous membrane. Within are a pair of *vocal folds, which function in the production of voice. —laryngeal adj.

The larynx.





LASEK laser in situ epithelial keratomileusis: a technique of laser refractive eye surgery used to correct both short sight (myopia) and long sight (hypermetropia). A flap of corneal epithelium is raised, the surface of the cornea is reshaped using an *excimer laser, and the epithelium is then replaced.

laser n. light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation: a laser is a device that emits light through such a process; it can be used to operate on small areas of abnormality without damaging the delicate surrounding tissues. For example, lasers are used to unblock coronary arteries narrowed by atheroma and to remove certain types of birthmark (see naevus). In ophthalmology different types of laser are used for operations on the cornea (see excimer laser), lens (see femtosecond laser), lens capsule (see YAG laser), and retina (see argon laser; diode laser) and for glaucoma (see trabeculoplasty). Lasers are also used in the treatment of *endometrial ablation and large fibroids (the Nd:YAG laser), *cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and varicose veins (*endovenous laser treatment).

laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) laser surgery to the palate, which is used in the treatment of *obstructive sleep apnoea.

Lasix n. see furosemide.

Lassa fever a serious virus disease confined to Central West Africa. After an incubation period of 3–21 days, headache, high fever, and severe muscular pains develop; difficulty in swallowing often arises. Death from kidney or heart failure occurs in over 50% of cases. Treatment with plasma from recovered patients is the best therapy, and the causative virus is susceptible to ribavirin.

LDL see low-density lipoprotein.

L-dopa n. see levodopa.

lead1 n. a soft bluish-grey metallic element that forms several poisonous compounds. Acute lead poisoning, which may follow inhalation of lead fumes or dust, causes abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with paralysis and convulsions and sometimes *encephalitis. In chronic poisoning a characteristic bluish marking of the gums (‘lead line’) is seen and the peripheral nerves are affected; there is also anaemia. Treatment is with *edetate. The use of lead in paints is now strictly controlled. Symbol: Pb.

lead2 n. 1. a portion of an electrocardiographic record that is obtained from a single electrode or a combination of electrodes placed on a particular part of the body (see electrocardiogram; electrocardiography). In the conventional ECG, 12 leads are recorded. Each lead represents the electrical activity of the heart as ‘viewed’ from a different position on the body surface and may help to localize myocardial damage. 2. a flexible steerable insulated wire introduced into the heart under X-ray control to allow electrical stimulation of the heart for the purpose of pacing (see pacemaker).

learning disability (learning difficulty) delayed or incomplete intellectual development combined with some form of social malfunction, such as educational or occupational failure or inability of individuals to look after themselves. The disability may be classified according to the *intelligence quotient (IQ) as mild (IQ 50–70), moderate to severe (IQ 20–50), and profound (IQ less than 20). Mildly disabled people often make a good adjustment to life after special help with education. The moderately and severely disabled usually need much more help and most are permanently dependent on other people, while the profoundly disabled usually need constant attention. There are very many causes of learning disability, including *Down’s syndrome, *autism, inherited metabolic disorders, brain injury, and gross psychological deprivation; some are preventable or treatable. Individuals with learning disability are at greater risk of developing mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and dementia. Good education alters the course of the disability, and a specialty of psychiatry provides treatment for patients who have a learning disability as well as a mental illness.

leather-bottle stomach see linitis plastica.

Leber’s congenital amaurosis a hereditary condition (inherited as an autosomal *recessive) causing severe visual loss in infants. The *fundus usually appears to be normal when examined with an *ophthalmoscope, but marked abnormalities are found on the ERG (see electroretinography), usually with extinguished wave pattern. [T. Leber (1840–1917), German ophthalmologist]

Leber’s optic atrophy a rare hereditary disorder, usually affecting young males, that is characterized by loss of central vision due to neuroretinal degeneration. Visual loss in one eye is rapid and usually followed by loss in the second eye. [T. Leber]

lecithin n. one of a group of *phospholipids that are important constituents of cell membranes and are involved in the metabolism of fat by the liver. An example is phosphatidylcholine. Lecithins are present in the *surfactant that occurs in fetal lung tissue. The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (LS ratio) is used as a measure of fetal lung maturity; an LS ratio below 2 indicates a higher risk of *respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In such cases cortisone may be given to stimulate fetal lung maturity and hence reduce the risk of RDS in the newborn.

lecithinase n. an enzyme from the small intestine that breaks *lecithin down into glycerol, fatty acids, phosphoric acid, and choline.

leech n. a type of worm that possesses suckers at both ends of its body. Leeches occur in tropical forests and grasslands and in water. Certain parasitic species suck blood from animals and humans, and their bites cause irritation and, in some cases, infection. A leech can be detached from its host by applying salt. Formerly widely used for letting blood, the medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) may now be used following microsurgery (e.g. to replace a severed finger) to restore patency to blocked or collapsed blood vessels and thus encourage the growth of new capillaries. The anticoagulants in the saliva of this and other species are now used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis (see hirudin).

leflunomide n. an *immunosuppressant drug used to treat rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis that have not responded to methotrexate or other *disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Side-effects, including blood disorders caused by impairment of bone-marrow function, may be severe.

left ventricular failure see heart failure.

Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (Perthes disease, pseudocoxalgia) necrosis of the head of the femur (thigh bone) due to interruption of its blood supply (see osteochondritis). Of unknown cause, it occurs most commonly in boys between the ages of 5 and 10 and causes aching and a limp. The head of the femur can collapse and become deformed, resulting in a short leg and restricted hip movement. Affected boys are kept under observation and their activities are restricted; surgery may be required in more severe cases. [A. T. Legg (1874–1939), US surgeon; J. Calvé (1875–1954), French orthopaedist; G. C. Perthes (1869–1927), German surgeon]

legionnaires’ disease an infection of the lungs caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, named after an outbreak at the American Legion convention in Pennsylvania in 1976. Legionella organisms are widely found in water; outbreaks of the disease have been associated with defective central heating, air conditioning, and other ventilating systems. Symptoms appear after an incubation period of 2–10 days: malaise and muscle pain are succeeded by a fever, dry cough, chest pain, and breathlessness. X-ray of the lungs shows patchy consolidation. Erythromycin provides the most effective therapy.

Leigh syndrome a rare metabolic disorder that affects movement and development. Affected children are initially normal but lose coordination and balance as the disease progresses. There is no known cure at present. See also mitochondrial disorders. [D. Leigh (1915–98), British psychiatrist]

leio- combining form denoting smoothness. Example: leiodermia (abnormal smoothness of the skin).

leiomyoma n. a benign tumour of smooth muscle. Such tumours occur most commonly in the uterus (see fibroid) but can also arise in the digestive tract, walls of blood vessels, etc. They may undergo malignant change (see leiomyosarcoma).

leiomyosarcoma n. a malignant tumour of smooth muscle, most commonly found in the uterus (it may arise in fibroids), stomach, small bowel, and at the base of the bladder. It is the second most common *sarcoma of soft tissues. This tumour is rare in children, occurring most commonly in the bladder, prostate, and stomach. Treatment is with surgery; these tumours are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Leishmania n. a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoans, several species of which cause disease in humans (see leishmaniasis). The parasite assumes a different form in each of its two hosts. In humans, especially in *kala-azar patients, it is a small rounded structure, with no flagellum, called a Leishman–Donovan body, which is found within the cells of the lymphatic system, spleen, and bone marrow. In the insect carrier it is long and flagellated.

leishmaniasis n. a disease, common in the tropics and subtropics, caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus *Leishmania, which are transmitted by the bite of sandflies. There are two principal forms of the disease: visceral leishmaniasis, in which the cells of various internal organs are affected (see kala-azar); and cutaneous leishmaniasis, which affects the tissues of the skin. Cutaneous leishmaniasis itself has several different forms, depending on the region in which it occurs and the species of Leishmania involved. In Asia it is common in the form of *oriental sore. In America there are several forms of leishmaniasis (see chiclero’s ulcer; espundia). Leishmaniasis is treated with drugs containing antimony.

lemniscus n. a ribbon-like tract of nerve tissue conveying information from the spinal cord and brainstem upwards through the midbrain to the higher centres.

lentigo n. (pl. lentigines) a flat dark brown spot found mainly in the elderly on skin exposed to light. Lentigines have increased numbers of *melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis (freckles, by contrast, do not show an increase in these cells). Lentigo maligna (preinvasive or in-situ melanoma) occurs on the cheeks of the elderly and has variable pigmentation.

leprosy (Hansen’s disease) n. a chronic disease, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, that affects the skin, mucous membranes, and nerves. It is confined mainly to the tropics and is transmitted by direct contact. After an incubation period of 1–30 years, symptoms develop gradually and mainly involve the skin and nerves. Lepromatous (multibacillary) leprosy is a contagious steadily progressive form of the disease characterized by the development of widely distributed lumps on the skin, thickening of the skin and nerves, and in serious cases by severe numbness of the skin, muscle weakness, and paralysis, which leads to disfigurement and deformity. Tuberculosis is a common complication. Tuberculoid leprosy is a benign, often self-limiting, form of leprosy causing discoloration and disfiguration of patches of skin (sparsely distributed) associated with localized numbness. Indeterminate leprosy is a form of the disease in which skin manifestations represent a combination of the two main types; tuberculoid and indeterminate leprosy are known as paucibacillary leprosy.

Like tuberculosis, leprosy should be treated with a combination of antibacterial drugs, to overcome the problem of resistance developing to a single drug; the WHO advocates a combination of rifampicin and dapsone for six months to treat paucibacillary leprosy and these drugs with the addition of clofazimine for multibacillary leprosy, this multidrug therapy (MDT) to be continued for two years. Reconstructive surgery can repair some of the damage caused by the disease. A vaccine is being developed and tested.

lept- (lepto-) combining form denoting 1. slender; thin. 2. small. 3. mild; slight.

leptin n. a protein that is produced and secreted by adipose tissue (especially white fat) and has a role in the regulation of eating (leptin receptors are concentrated in the hypothalamus). Increased amounts of adipose tissue result in higher concentrations of leptin and a reduction in appetite. A deficiency of leptin is responsible for a few cases of obesity.

leuc- (leuco-, leuk-, leuko-) combining form denoting 1. lack of colour; white. 2. leucocytes.

leucapheresis n. a procedure for removing a quantity of white cells from the blood. Blood is withdrawn from the patient through a vein and passed through a machine (a cell separator). White cells are removed and the rest of the blood is returned to the patient through another vein. This method can be used to collect peripheral blood *stem cells from a patient.

leucine n. an *essential amino acid. See also amino acid.

leucocyte (white blood cell) n. any blood cell that contains a nucleus. In health there are three major subdivisions: *granulocytes, *lymphocytes and *monocytes, which are part of the immune system, being involved in protecting the body against foreign substances and in antibody production. In disease, a variety of other types may appear in the blood, most notably immature forms of the normal red or white blood cells.

An abnormally large discharge may indicate infection of the lower reproductive tract, e.g. *vaginitis, *Chlamydia, or *bacterial vaginosis.

leucostasis (leukostasis) n. abnormal leucocyte aggregation and clumping associated with a very high white blood cell count, often seen in *leukaemia patients. The brain and lungs are the two most commonly affected organs.

leucotomy n. the surgical operation of interrupting the pathways of white nerve fibres within the brain: it was formerly the most common procedure in *psychosurgery. In the original form, prefrontal leucotomy (lobotomy), the operation involved cutting through the nerve fibres connecting the *frontal lobe with the *thalamus and the association fibres of the frontal lobe. This was often successful in reducing severe emotional tension. However, prefrontal leucotomy had serious side-effects and the procedure has now been abandoned.

Modern procedures use *stereotaxy and make selective lesions in smaller areas of the brain. Side-effects are uncommon and the operation is very occasionally (only a few each year in the UK) used for intractable pain, severe depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and chronic anxiety, where very severe emotional tension has not been relieved by other treatments.

leukaemia n. any of a group of malignant diseases in which the bone marrow and other blood-forming organs produce increased numbers of certain types of white blood cells (*leucocytes). Overproduction of these white cells, which are immature or abnormal forms, suppresses the production of normal white cells, red cells, and platelets. This leads to increased susceptibility to infection (due to *neutropenia), *anaemia, and bleeding (due to *thrombocytopenia). Other symptoms include enlargement of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes.

Leukaemias are classified into acute or chronic varieties depending on the rate of progression of the disease. They are also classified according to the type of white cell that is proliferating abnormally; for example acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (see lymphoblast), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (see lymphocyte), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (see myeloblast), hairy-cell leukaemia (see hairy cell), and monocytic leukaemia (see monocyte). (See also myeloid leukaemia.) Leukaemias can be treated with *cytotoxic drugs or *monoclonal antibodies, which suppress the production of the abnormal cells, or occasionally with radiotherapy.

leukotriene n. one of a class of powerful chemical agents synthesized from arachidonic acid by mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and various other tissues. Leukotrienes are involved in inflammatory reactions and the immune response: they increase the permeability of small blood vessels, cause contraction of smooth muscle, and attract neutrophils to the site of an infection.

leukotriene receptor antagonist one of a class of drugs that prevent the action of *leukotrienes by blocking their receptors on cell membranes, such as those in the airways. These drugs are used in the management of asthma for their effects in relaxing the smooth muscle of the airways and in reducing inflammation in the bronchial linings.

These drugs prevent the breakdown of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, which reduces the severity of side-effects and enables lower doses of levodopa to be given. Side-effects may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, faintness on standing up, and involuntary facial movements.

levodopa test a test of the ability of the pituitary to secrete growth hormone, in which levodopa is administered by mouth and plasma levels of growth hormone are subsequently measured (they should peak within the following hour). It is a safer alternative to the *insulin stress test but does not give information on cortisol production, which is usually more clinically important to know.

levomepromazine (methotrimeprazine) n. a phenothiazine *antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia and to relieve agitation, nausea and vomiting, and pain in terminally ill patients. Side-effects include drowsiness and weakness.

levonorgestrel n. a synthetic female sex hormone – a *progestogen – used mainly in *oral contraceptives, either in combination with an oestrogen or as a progestogen-only preparation.

liaison psychiatry the interface between medicine and psychiatry, recognized by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as a specialty of psychiatry. Liaison teams ideally consist of psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, health-care support workers, and social workers. They are usually located in general hospitals and see patients after *deliberate self-harm or when a mental illness or *delirium is suspected anywhere in the hospital, in order to diagnose and advise on treatment. They offer *psychosocial assessments, treatment plans, medication advice, and advice regarding mental health and capacity legislation, and support ward staff with the management of challenging patients. They also help develop plans for earlier discharges, provide training, and support governance structures.

libido n. 1. (in psychoanalytic theory) the life instinct or, specifically, the sexual instinct. The libido (like the death instinct) is said to be one of the fundamental sources of energy for all mental life. 2. sexual desire. Reduced or low libido may be caused by psychological or physical factors, or by mental illnesses, such as depression.

Librium n. see chlordiazepoxide.

lice pl. n. see louse; pediculosis.

licence n. 1. (in pharmaceutics) a document that allows a pharmaceutical company to market a particular drug. The company must apply for a licence to the regulatory body that issues them: in the UK this is the *Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. A drug is licensed only for defined uses (indications), which the health-care professional prescribing it should adhere to. 2. (licence to practice) (in general practice) see licensing.

licensing n. a system in which the medical register shows whether a doctor is a licensed medical practitioner or holds registration only. It is the licence to practise rather than registration that signifies to patients and employers that a doctor has the legal authority to hold a post as a doctor, write prescriptions, sign death certificates, and exercise various other legal privileges. See also revalidation.

lichenification n. thickening of the epidermis of the skin with exaggeration of the normal creases, thought to resemble tree bark. The cause is abnormal scratching or rubbing of the skin. It is one of the cardinal features of chronic eczema, together with erythema (flushing), pruritus (itching), and xerosis (dryness).

lichenoid adj. describing any skin disease that resembles *lichen planus.

lichen planus an extremely itchy skin disease of unknown cause. Shiny flat-topped pink/purple spots may occur anywhere but are characteristically found on the inside of the wrists. It may take the form of a white lacy pattern in the mouth, which usually produces no symptoms. Trauma, such as a scratch, may induce a linear form of the disease (see Koebner phenomenon). Treatment with potent topical corticosteroids gives symptomatic relief. Tablet treatments may be necessary for generalized disease.

lichen sclerosus a chronic skin disease affecting the anogenital area (and rarely other sites), especially the vulva in women and foreskin in men. It is characterized by sheets of thin ivory-white skin and may be caused by chronic irritation by urine. There is a risk of *squamous cell carcinoma. In women, the condition causes intense itching, and atrophy of the labia minora often occurs. Potent topical corticosteroids are helpful for women. In men, normal penile architecture is progressively lost and a constricting band around the foreskin may appear (causing sexual dysfunction and sometimes *paraphimosis) or sometimes narrowing of the urethral meatus may occur. This sometimes necessitates circumcision.

lichen simplex chronicus (neurodermatitis) thickened eczematous skin that develops at the site of constant rubbing in susceptible individuals. Common sites are the nape of the neck in women and the lower legs or scrotum in men. Stress may be a relevant factor.

Liddle’s syndrome a rare autosomal *dominant condition characterized by hypertension associated with hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low levels of plasma *renin and *aldosterone. The hypertension often starts in infancy and is due to excess resorption of sodium and excretion of potassium by the renal tubules. The syndrome is caused by a single genetic mutation on chromosome 16, which results in dysregulation of a sodium channel in the distal convoluted tubule. Treatment is with a low salt diet and a potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the sodium channel, such as amiloride or triamterene. [G. G. Liddle (1921–89), US endocrinologist]

lidocaine (lignocaine) n. a widely used local *anaesthetic administered by injection for minor surgery and dental procedures. For the latter it is normally used in combination with adrenaline to achieve better and longer anaesthesia. Alone or in combination with other agents, it can also be applied directly to the eye, throat, and mouth, as it is absorbed through mucous membranes, and to the skin. Lidocaine is also injected intravenously to treat conditions involving abnormal heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias), particularly following myocardial infarction. When used as a local anaesthetic, side-effects are uncommon.

lightening n. the sensation experienced, usually after the 36th week of gestation, by many pregnant women, particularly those carrying their first child, as the presenting part of the fetus enters the pelvis. This reduces the pressure on the diaphragm and the woman notices that it is easier to breathe. Compare engagement.

light reflex see pupillary reflex.

lignocaine n. see lidocaine.

Among the brain regions involved are the *amygdala, *hippocampal formation, and *hypothalamus. The activities of the body that are governed are those concerned with self-preservation (e.g. searching for food, fighting) and preservation of the species (e.g. reproduction and the care of offspring), the expression of fear, rage, and pleasure, and the establishment of memory patterns. See also reticular activating system.

limb lengthening an orthopaedic procedure for increasing the length of a limb (usually the leg). An *external fixator is attached to the bone. This can be a circular frame surrounding the bone, which was invented by the Russian surgeon Ilizarov, or a bar down one side of the limb. The bone is divided, and the gap produced is slowly widened by moving the two ends of the frame apart; if a bar fixator is used, its body has a screw thread that is turned to increase the distance between the two ends. New bone is produced in the widening gap as the bone is stretched (see callotasis). Limb lengthening is undertaken when there is inequality in the length of the legs; for example, following trauma or resulting from paralysis in childhood. Both legs can be lengthened to increase the height of a person of excessively short stature.

The cancerous organ is at a higher temperature than normal body temperature, so that when the liposome passes through its blood vessels the membrane melts and the drug (e.g. *doxorubicin) is released. Liposomes are also undergoing clinical trials as vehicles in *gene therapy for cystic fibrosis.

liposuction n. a technique for removing unwanted collections of subcutaneous fat by using a powerful suction tube passed through the skin at different locations.

lipotrophin n. a hormone-like substance from the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the transfer of fat from the body stores to the bloodstream.

lipotropic adj. describing a substance that promotes the transport of fatty acids from the liver to the tissues or accelerates the utilization of fat in the liver itself. An example of such a substance is the amino acid methionine.

lipping n. overgrowth of bone around a joint as seen on X-ray. This is a characteristic sign of degenerative joint disease and occurs most frequently and prominently in osteoarthritis. See also osteophyte.

Lipsitz score a scoring system used for newborn babies who may be withdrawing from maternal opioids or other (usually nonprescription) drugs. See neonatal abstinence syndrome.

lipuria n. the presence of fat or oil droplets in the urine.

liquid-based cytology (LBC) a technique used for analysing *cervical smears taken for *cervical screening. The specimen is collected using a brush or spatula and then mixed with a liquid preservative fluid. In the laboratory, this fluid is spun and filtered to remove blood and other extraneous material, leaving a thin layer of cells that is spread on a microscope slide and examined. LBC yields specimens that are easier to screen and give more accurate results than those obtained by the traditional Pap test.

liquor n. 1. (in pharmacy) any solution, usually an aqueous solution. 2. the amniotic fluid surrounding a fetus.

LI-RADS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System: see BI-RADS.

liraglutide n. see GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Lisch nodules pigmented *hamartomas of the iris of the eye seen in *neurofibromatosis type I. [K. Lisch (1907–99), Austrian ophthalmologist]

lissencephaly (smooth brain) n. a condition in which the brain develops abnormally – it has no grooves on the outside, large ventricles, and generally is smaller than it should be. Lissencephaly causes severe learning disabilities and *failure to thrive. See also Miller–Dieker syndrome.

Listeria n. a genus of Gram-positive aerobic motile rodlike bacteria that are parasites of warm-blooded animals. The single species, L. monocytogenes, infects many domestic and wild animals. If it is transmitted to humans, by eating infected animals or animal products, it may cause disease (listeriosis), especially in the frail, ranging from influenza-like symptoms to meningoencephalitis. In pregnant women it may cause a miscarriage or damage the fetus.

lith- (litho-) combining form denoting a calculus (stone). Example: lithogenesis (formation of).

-lith combining form denoting a calculus (stone). Example: faecalith (a stony mass of faeces).

lithaemia n. see hyperuricaemia.

lithiasis n. formation of stones (see calculus) in an internal organ, such as the gall bladder (see gallstone), urinary system, pancreas, or appendix.

lithium n. a metallic element used in the form of its salts (lithium carbonate and lithium citrate) to prevent and treat episodes of mania or depression in patients with *bipolar affective disorder, and sometimes chronic or recurrent depression. Side-effects include tremor, weakness, nausea, thirst, and excessive urination. Thyroid function can be impaired after many years of use and regular thyroid function tests are compulsory. Reversible changes in the kidney as well as *diabetes insipidus can appear after long-term lithium treatment. The therapeutic range of lithium is relatively small, therefore levels of lithium in the blood are regularly checked during long-term therapy.

litholapaxy (lithotripsy) n. the operation of crushing a stone in the bladder, using an instrument called a lithotrite. The small fragments of stone can then be removed by irrigation and suction.

lithonephrotomy n. surgical removal of a stone from the kidney. See nephrolithotomy; pyelolithotomy.

lithopaedion n. a fetus that has died in the uterus or abdominal cavity and has become calcified.

lithotomy n. the surgical removal of a stone (calculus) from the urinary tract. See nephrolithotomy; pyelolithotomy; ureterolithotomy.

lithotomy position an operating-table position that allows good access to the pelvis and perineum. The patient is placed supine so that the buttocks are at the edge of the table. The feet are placed in individual stirrups and the knees bent to allow the feet to be placed above or at the same level as the hips.

lithotripsy n. 1. the process of breaking calculi (stones) into smaller fragments by the application of shock waves. This will enable the stones to pass naturally or be removed more easily. In extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), used for breaking calculi in the upper urinary tract, the shock waves are generated and transmitted by an external power source. The specialized machine (a lithotripter) consists of a sophisticated radiological system to localize the stone accurately by biplanar X-ray and a shock head or transducer to produce and focus the energy source. The prototype machines required the patient to be anaesthetized and immersed in a water bath for treatment, but modern machines require neither water bath nor general anaesthesia. In electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), used for breaking urinary calculi, an electrically generated shock wave is transmitted to the stone by a contact probe delivered via a *nephroscope or *ureteroscope. Laser lithotripsy has also been available since the 1980s. 2. see litholapaxy.

lithotrite n. a surgical instrument used for crushing a stone in the bladder. See litholapaxy.

lithotrophic adj. see autotrophic.

lithuresis n. the passage of small stones or *gravel in the urine.

lithuria n. see hyperuricuria.

litre n. a unit of volume equal to the volume occupied by 1 kilogram of pure water at 4°C and 760 mmHg pressure. In *SI units the litre is treated as a special name for the cubic decimetre, but is not used when a high degree of accuracy is required (1 litre = 1.0000028 dm3). For approximate purposes 1 litre is assumed to be equal to 1000 cubic centimetres (cm3), therefore 1 millilitre (ml) is often taken to be equal to 1 cm3. This practice is now deprecated.

Little’s area the anterior region of the nasal septum (see nose). It has a rich capillary supply, called *Kiesselbach’s plexus, and is a common site from which nosebleeds arise. See epistaxis. [J. L. Little (1836–85), US surgeon]

Little’s disease a form of *cerebral palsy involving both sides of the body and affecting the legs more severely than the arms. [W. J. Little (1810–94), British surgeon]

Litzmann’s obliquity see asynclitism. [K. C. T. Litzmann (1815–90), German obstetrician]

livedo n. a discoloured area or spot on the skin, often caused by local congestion of the circulation.

liver n. the largest gland of the body, weighing 1200–1600 g. Situated in the top right portion of the abdominal cavity, the liver is divided by fissures (fossae) into four lobes: the right (the largest lobe), left, quadrate, and caudate lobes. It is connected to the diaphragm and abdominal walls by five ligaments: the membranous falciform (which separates the right and left lobes), coronary, and right and left triangular ligaments and the fibrous round ligament, which is derived from the embryonic umbilical vein. Venous blood containing digested food is brought to the liver in the hepatic portal vein (see portal system). Branches of this vein pass in between the lobules and terminate in the sinusoids (see illustration).

Oxygenated blood is supplied in the hepatic artery. The blood leaves the liver via a central vein in each lobule, which drains into the *hepatic vein. The liver is supplied by parasympathetic nerve fibres from the vagus nerve, and by sympathetic fibres from the solar plexus. The liver has a number of important functions. It synthesizes *bile, which drains into the *gall bladder before being released into the duodenum. The liver is an important site of metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It regulates the amount of blood sugar, converting excess glucose to *glycogen; it removes excess amino acids by breaking them down into ammonia and finally *urea; and it stores and metabolizes fats. The liver also synthesizes *fibrinogen and *prothrombin (essential blood-clotting substances) and *heparin, an anticoagulant. It forms red blood cells in the fetus and is the site of production of plasma proteins. It has an important role in the detoxification of poisonous substances and it breaks down worn out red cells and other unwanted substances, such as excess oestrogen in the male (see also Kupffer cells). The liver is also the site of *vitamin A synthesis; this vitamin is stored in the liver, together with vitamins B12, D, and K.

The liver is the site of many important diseases, including *hepatitis, *cirrhosis, amoebic *dysentery, *hydatid disease, and *hepatomas.

lobotomy (prefrontal leucotomy) n. see leucotomy.

lobular carcinoma cancer that arises in the lobules (rather than the ducts) of the breast. Like ductal carcinoma, it may be confined to its site of origin but can invade other tissues; however, it has a greater tendency than ductal carcinoma to affect both breasts.

lobule n. a subdivision of a part or organ that can be distinguished from the whole by boundaries, such as septa, that are visible with or without a microscope. For example, the lobule of the liver is a structural and functional unit seen in cross-section under a microscope as a column of cells drained by a central vein and bounded by a branch of the portal vein. The lung lobule is a practical subdivision of the lung tissue seen macroscopically in lung slices as outlined by incomplete septa of fibrous tissue. It is made up of three to five lung *acini.

Löfgren’s syndrome an acute form of *sarcoidosis characterized by fever, *erythema nodosum, enlarged lymph nodes near the inner border of the lungs, joint pain or inflammation, often involving the ankles, and *uveitis. Symptoms may resolve spontaneously after a few weeks or may need therapy with NSAIDs or low-dose corticosteroids. Recurrence may occur in a minority of patients. [S. Löfgren (1910–78), Swedish clinician]

log- (logo-) combining form denoting words; speech.

LogMAR chart a chart for testing *visual acuity in which the rows of letters (optotypes) vary in size in a logarithmic progression. The space between the letters in a row and the space between each row is identical to the size of the letters in that row. This neutralizes the effect of crowding on vision. There are five letters in each row and each letter has a score of 0.02 log unit (the name derives from logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). This makes it more accurate than a *Snellen chart and it is becoming increasingly used in testing vision. Most tests are done at a distance of 4 metres, allowing it to be used in smaller rooms. The acuity is scored as a number, with 1 being the same as 6/60 on the Snellen chart and 0 being equivalent to 6/6 (normal visual acuity). Vision better than 6/6 is scored as a negative, e.g. –0.18.

logopaedics n. the scientific study of defects and disabilities of speech and of the methods used to treat them. See also speech and language therapy.

logorrhoea n. a rapid flow of voluble speech, often with incoherence, such as is encountered in *mania.

-logy (-ology) combining form denoting field of study. Example: cytology (study of cells).

loiasis n. a disease, occurring in West and Central Africa, caused by the eye worm *Loa loa. The adult worms live and migrate within the skin tissues, causing the appearance of transitory calabar swellings. These are probably an allergic reaction to the worms’ waste products, and they sometimes lead to fever and itching. Worms often migrate across the eyeball just beneath the conjunctiva, where they cause irritation and congestion. Loiasis is treated with *diethylcarbamazine, which kills both the adults and larval forms.

loin n. the region of the back and side of the body between the lowest rib and the pelvis.

Lomotil n. see co-phenotrope.

lordosis n. inward curvature of the spine, which appears as a forward curvature when viewed from the side. A certain degree of lordosis is normal in the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine: loss of this may occur in ankylosing *spondylitis. Exaggerated lordosis may occur through faulty posture or as a result of disorders of vertebral development and spinal muscles. Compare kyphosis.

losartan n. see angiotensin II antagonist.

loss n. no longer having some valued aspect of one’s life, such as a relationship, a job, or a home, that one has previously enjoyed. This may have health consequences: shock, disbelief, and emotional numbness may be followed by anger, guilt, anxiety, or profound sadness. Such emotions may lead to behavioural changes or symptoms that bring people to health care. Encouraging the patient to talk about the loss will require *empathy, sensitivity, and *judgment from the professional, both to obtain the history of the events and to provide helpful advice and direction to assist in adjustment. See also bereavement.

lotion n. a medicinal solution for washing or bathing the external parts of the body. Lotions usually have a cooling, soothing, or antiseptic action.

(loupes) a binocular telescope system of variable magnification range mounted on a spectacle frame or a headband and used in microsurgical procedures, such as nerve repair or anastomosis of fine vessels.

louse n. (pl. lice) a small wingless insect that is an external parasite of humans. Lice attach themselves to hair and clothing using their well-developed legs and claws. Their flattened leathery bodies are resistant to crushing and their mouthparts are adapted for sucking blood. Lice thrive in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions; they can infest humans (see pediculosis) and they may transmit disease. See also Pediculus; Phthirus.

Løvset’s manoeuvre rotation of the trunk of the fetus during a breech birth to facilitate delivery of the arms and the shoulders. This procedure is used when the fetal arms are extended due to previous inappropriate traction. [J. Løvset (20th century), Norwegian obstetrician]

low-density lipoprotein (LDL) a *lipoprotein that is the principal form in which *cholesterol is transported in the bloodstream: it accounts for approximately 70% of the circulating cholesterol in an individual. LDL is derived from *very low-density lipoprotein and is eventually cleared from the circulation by the liver. LDL may be deposited within the lining of arteries, thus causing *atheroma; the higher the circulating concentration of LDL, the higher the likelihood of atheroma developing (see also hypercholesterolaemia). *Statins are effective in lowering circulating LDL levels.

lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) symptoms occurring during urine storage, voiding, or immediately after. These include *frequency, *urgency, *nocturia, *incontinence, *hesitation, *intermittency, *terminal dribble, *dysuria, and *postmicturition dribble. These symptoms used to be known as prostatism. Sometimes they are due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland), but they may be due to *detrusor overactivity, excessive drinking, diuresis due to poorly controlled diabetes, or a urethral stricture.

lower uterine segment the lower portion of uterus, lying below the loose fold of peritoneum that lies between the uterus and bladder. This does not form until later in pregnancy and is less contractile than the rest of the uterus. A *Caesarean section is performed through the lower segment.

lucid interval temporary recovery of consciousness after a blow to the head, before relapse into coma. It is a sign of intracranial arterial bleeding (extradural *haematoma).

Ludwig’s angina severe inflammation caused by infection of both sides of the floor of the mouth, resulting in massive swelling of the neck. If untreated, it may obstruct the airways, necessitating tracheostomy. [W. F. von Ludwig (1770–1865), German surgeon]

lues n. a serious infectious disease such as syphilis.

Lugol’s solution (aqueous iodine oral solution) a solution of 5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide, used in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis in emergencies, such as *thyroid crisis, or when surgery cannot wait for more conventional treatments. For its mode of action it utilizes the abnormal *Wolff–Chaikoff effect, seen in cases of thyroiditis. [J. G. A. Lugol (1786–1851), French physician]

lumbago n. pain in the lumbar or loin region, of any cause or description. Severe lumbago, of sudden onset while bending or lifting, can be due either to a slipped disc or to a strained muscle or ligament. When associated with *sciatica it is often due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc.

lumbar adj. relating to the loin.

lumbar puncture a procedure performed under local anaesthetic in which cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn by means of a hollow needle inserted into the *subarachnoid space in the region of the lower back (usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae). The fluid obtained is examined for diagnosis of meningitis, multiple sclerosis, and various other disorders of the brain and spinal cord. Lumbar puncture may also be performed to inject agents into the subarachnoid space. The procedure is usually without risk to the patient, but in patients with raised intracranial pressure it may be hazardous. CT and MRI scanning prior to lumbar puncture have greatly reduced the risk of performing the test in patients with unsuspected raised intracranial pressure. The commonest side-effect of the procedure is a headache that is worse on standing and reduces on lying down (*intracranial hypotension headache). See also Queckenstedt test.

lumbar triangle a weak area in the abdomen bounded by the iliac crest (below), the external oblique muscle (in front), and the erector spinae muscle (behind). It can be the site of a lumbar hernia.

The procedure, usually followed by radiation, is indicated for patients with a tumour less than 2 cm in diameter and who have no metastases to local lymph nodes or to distant organs.

lunate bone a bone of the wrist (see carpus). It articulates with the capitate and hamate bones in front, with the radius behind, and with the triquetral and scaphoid at the sides.

lung n. one of the pair of organs of *respiration, situated in the chest cavity on either side of the heart and enclosed by a serous membrane (see pleura). The lungs are fibrous elastic sacs that are expanded and compressed by movements of the rib cage and diaphragm during *breathing. They communicate with the atmosphere through the *trachea, which opens into the pharynx. The trachea divides into two bronchi (see bronchus), which enter the lungs and branch into *bronchioles. These divide further and terminate in minute air sacs (see alveolus), the sites of gaseous exchange. (See illustration.) Atmospheric oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide from the blood of the pulmonary capillaries is released into the lungs; in each case down a concentration gradient (see pulmonary circulation). The total capacity of the lungs in an adult male is about 5.5 litres, but during normal breathing only about 500 ml of air is exchanged (see also residual volume). Other functions of the lung include water evaporation: an important factor in the fluid balance and heat regulation of the body.

• British Lung Foundation: basic information on the lungs and some common lung conditions

lung cancer cancer arising in the epithelium of the air passages (bronchial cancer) or lung (see also non-small-cell lung cancer; small-cell lung cancer). It is a very common form of cancer, particularly in Britain, and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking and exposure to industrial air pollutants (including asbestos). There are often no symptoms in the early stages of the disease, when diagnosis is made on X-ray examination. Treatment includes surgical removal of the affected lobe or lung (less than 20% of cases are suitable for surgery), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

lunula n. the whitish crescent-shaped area at the base of a *nail.

lupus n. any of several chronic skin diseases. See lupus erythematosus; lupus verrucosus; lupus vulgaris.

lupus anticoagulant one of several autoantibodies that can cause *antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Despite the name, the antibody behaves as a coagulant, increasing the risk of thrombosis. It can be found in 50% of patients with APS.

lupus erythematosus (LE) a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of connective tissue, affecting the skin and various internal organs (systemic LE, SLE). Typically, there is a red butterfly-shaped rash on the face, over the cheek and bridge of the nose (butterfly rash); arthritis; and progressive damage to the kidneys. Often the heart, lungs, and brain are also affected by progressive attacks of inflammation followed by the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis). In a milder form, known as discoid LE (DLE), only the skin is affected. LE is an *autoimmune disease and can be diagnosed by the presence of abnormal antibodies in the bloodstream. The disease is treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs.

lupus nephritis a frequent and serious complication of systemic *lupus erythematosus (SLE). The 2002 WHO/ISN/RPS classification of lupus nephritis recognizes six classes: class I is the presence of mesangial deposits (see juxtaglomerular apparatus) seen on immunofluorescence and/or electron microscopy; class II is the presence of mesangial deposits and mesangial hypercellularity; class III is focal and segmental *glomerulonephritis; class IV is diffuse segmental or global nephritis; class V is *membranous nephropathy; and class VI is advanced sclerotic glomerulonephritis. Untreated, outcomes are poor in classes III and IV, but much improved with immunosuppressant treatment.

lupus verrucosus a rare tuberculous infection of the skin – commonly the arm or hand – typified by warty lesions. It occurs in those who have been reinfected with tuberculosis.

lupus vulgaris tuberculous infection of the skin, usually due to direct inoculation of the tuberculosis bacillus into the skin. It is no longer common in the developed world. This type of lupus often starts in childhood, with dark red patches on the nose or cheek. Unless treated, lupus vulgaris may spread, ulcerate, and cause extensive scarring. Treatment is with antituberculous drugs.

Lyell’s syndrome see toxic epidermal necrolysis. [A. Lyell (20th century), British dermatologist]

Lyme disease a disease caused by a spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted by certain ticks of the genus Ixodes. Following a 3–32-day incubation period, a slowly extending red rash develops in approximately 75% of cases; intermittent systemic symptoms include fever, malaise, headache and neck stiffness, and muscle and joint pains. Later, 60% of patients suffer intermittent attacks of arthritis, especially of the knees, each attack lasting months and recurring over several years. The spirochaete has been identified in synovium and synovial fluid. Neurological and cardiac involvement occurs in a smaller percentage of cases. Treatment is with doxycycline or a penicillin.

lymph n. the fluid present within the vessels of the *lymphatic system. It consists of the fluid that bathes the tissues, which is derived from the blood and is drained by the lymphatic vessels. Lymph passes through a series of filters (*lymph nodes) and is ultimately returned to the bloodstream via the *thoracic duct. It is similar in composition to plasma, but contains less protein and some cells, mainly *lymphocytes.

lymphaden- (lymphadeno-) combining form denoting lymph node(s).

lymphadenectomy n. surgical removal of lymph nodes, an operation commonly performed when a cancer has invaded nodes in the drainage area of an organ infiltrated by a malignant growth. The whole chain of lymph nodes draining the tumour is excised. This is performed for local control and also staging of the cancer, to plan further treatment and for prognosis.

lymphadenitis n. inflammation of lymph nodes, which become swollen, painful, and tender. Some cases may be chronic (e.g. tuberculous lymphadenitis) but most are acute and localized adjacent to an area of infection. The most commonly affected lymph nodes are those in the neck, in association with tonsillitis. The lymph nodes help to contain and combat the infection. Occasionally generalized lymphadenitis occurs as a result of virus infections. The treatment is that of the cause.

lymphadenopathy n. enlargement of the lymph nodes. This is usually due to infection (e.g. viral or bacterial), when the nodes are painful and tender, but may alternatively be caused by malignancy (e.g. leukaemias, lymphomas), autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosis), or adverse drug reactions.

lymphangi- (lymphangio-) combining form denoting a lymphatic vessel.

lymphangiectasis n. dilatation of the lymphatic vessels, which is usually congenital and produces enlargement of various parts of the body (e.g. the leg in Milroy’s disease). It may also be caused by obstruction of the lymphatic vessels. See lymphoedema.

lymphangiography (lymphography) n. X-ray examination of the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes after a contrast medium has been injected into them (see angiography). Lymphatic vessels in the upper part of the foot are dissected and cannulated after injecting methylene blue into the web space to identify them. Then a viscous contrast medium (Lipiodol) is injected into them at a very slow rate. Its main uses are in the investigation of the extent and spread of cancer of the lymphatic system, the investigation of lymphoedema, and postoperative collection from lymphatic damage. Newer techniques involve injection of contrast medium directly into the lymph nodes (intranodal lymphangiography). Alternatively, the lymphatic system can be imaged using a gamma camera following the injection of a radioactive tracer. This examination has now largely been replaced by other *cross-sectional imaging techniques.

lymphangioma n. a localized collection of distended lymphatic vessels, which may result in a large cyst in the neck or armpit. This can be removed surgically.

lymphangiosarcoma n. a rare malignant tumour of the lymphatic vessels. It is most commonly seen in the chronically swollen (oedematous) arms of women who have had a mastectomy for breast cancer and may be induced by radiation.

lymphangitis n. inflammation of the lymphatic vessels, which can be seen most commonly as red streaks in the skin adjacent to a focus of streptococcal infection. Occasionally a more chronic form results in *lymphoedema. The infected part is rested and the infection can be eliminated by an antibiotic (e.g. penicillin).

lymphatic 1. n. a lymphatic vessel. See lymphatic system. 2. adj. relating to or transporting lymph.

lymphatic system a network of vessels that conveys electrolytes, water, proteins, etc. – in the form of *lymph – from the tissue fluids to the bloodstream (see illustration). It consists of fine blind-ended lymphatic capillaries, which unite to form lymphatic vessels. At various points along the lymphatic vessels are *lymph nodes. Lymph drains into the capillaries and passes into the lymphatic vessels, which have valves to prevent backflow of lymph. The lymphatics lead to two large channels – the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct – which return the lymph to the bloodstream via the innominate veins.

The lymphatic system.





lymph node one of a number of small swellings found at intervals along the lymphatic system. Groups of nodes are found in many parts of the body; for example, in the groin and armpit and behind the ear. They are composed of lymphoid tissue and act as filters for the lymph, preventing foreign particles from entering the bloodstream; they also produce lymphocytes.

lympho- combining form denoting lymph or the lymphatic system.

lymphoblast n. an abnormal cell present in the blood and the blood-forming organs in one type of leukaemia (lymphoblastic leukaemia). It has a large nucleus with very scanty cytoplasm and is thought to be the precursor of the lymphocyte. —lymphoblastic adj.

lymphocyte n. a variety of white blood cell (leucocyte), present also in the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus gland, gut wall, and bone marrow. With *Romanowsky stains, lymphocytes can be seen to have dense nuclei with clear pale-blue cytoplasm. Lymphocytes with scanty cytoplasm are small lymphocytes; those with abundant cytoplasm are large lymphocytes. There are normally 1.5–4.0 × 109 lymphocytes per litre of blood. They are involved in *immunity and can be subdivided into B lymphocytes (or B cells), which produce circulating antibodies, and T lymphocytes (or T cells), which are primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity. T lymphocytes can differentiate into *helper T cells or *cytotoxic T cells. There is an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow in chronic lymphocytic *leukaemia. —lymphocytic adj.

lymphoedema n. an accumulation of lymph in the tissues, producing swelling; the legs are most often affected. It may be due to a congenital abnormality of the lymphatic vessels (as in Milroy’s disease, congenital lymphoedema of the legs) or result from obstruction of the lymphatic vessels by a tumour, parasites, inflammation, or injury. Treatment consists of elastic support, by stockings or bandages, and diuretic drugs. A variety of surgical procedures has been devised but with little success.

lymphogranuloma venereum a sexually transmitted disease that is caused by *Chlamydia and is most common in tropical regions. An initial lesion on the genitals is followed by swelling and inflammation of the lymph nodes in the groin; the lymph vessels in the genital region may become blocked, causing thickening of the skin of that area. Early treatment with sulphonamides or tetracyclines is usually effective.

Disease may be widespread, but in some cases is confined to a single area, which may be extranodal (such as the tonsil). Treatment is with drugs such as chlorambucil or combinations of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone, sometimes with the addition of doxorubicin and/or bleomycin; response to these drugs is often dramatic. New *targeted agents are used depending on the expression of cell surface molecules, particularly *rituximab against CD20 in diffuse B-cell lymphoma. Localized disease may be treated with radiotherapy followed by drugs. Patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who do not respond to chemotherapy may be considered for a bone-marrow transplant.

Lyon hypothesis the hypothesis that gene dosage imbalance between males and females, because of the presence of two X chromosomes in females (XX) as opposed to only one in males (XY), is compensated for by random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in the somatic cells of females. The inactivated X chromosome becomes the Barr body (see sex chromatin). [M. F. Lyon (1925–2014), British geneticist]

lys- (lysi-, lyso-) combining form denoting lysis; dissolution.

lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) an illegal hallucinogenic drug that was formerly used to aid treatment of certain psychological disorders. Side-effects include digestive upsets, dizziness, tingling, anxiety, sweating, dilated pupils, muscle incoordination and tremor. Alterations in sight, hearing, and other senses occur, psychotic effects, depression, and confusion are common, and tolerance to the drug develops rapidly. Because of these toxic effects, LSD is no longer used clinically. See Appendix 12 for a list of street names for illicit drugs.

lysin n. a specific *complement-fixing antibody that is capable of bringing about the destruction (lysis) of whole cells. Names are given to varieties of lysin with different targets; for example, haemolysin attacks red blood cells; leucolysin attacks white cells; and a bacteriolysin targets bacterial cells.

Under certain conditions (e.g. irradiation of the bacterium) the phage can develop into an active form, which reproduces itself and eventually destroys the bacterial cell.

lysosome n. a particle in the cytoplasm of cells that contains enzymes responsible for breaking down substances in the cell and is bounded by a single membrane. Lysosomes are especially abundant in liver and kidney cells. Foreign particles (e.g. bacteria) taken into the cell are broken down by the enzymes of the lysosomes. When the cell dies, these enzymes are released to break down the cell’s components.

lysozyme n. an enzyme found in tears and egg white. It catalyses the destruction of the cell walls of certain bacteria. Bacterial cells that are attacked by lysozyme are said to have been lysed.

This condition is associated with poorly controlled maternal diabetes, the increased size being due to excessive production of fetal insulin and thence to increased deposition of glycogen in the fetus, and maternal obesity.

macrotia n. a congenital deformity of the external ear in which the *pinna is larger than normal.

macula n. (pl. maculae) a small anatomical area that is distinguishable from the surrounding tissue. The macula lutea is the yellow spot on the retina at the back of the eye, which surrounds the greatest concentration of cones (see fovea). Maculae occur in the saccule and utricle of the inner ear (see illustration). Tilting of the head causes the otoliths to bend the hair cells, which send impulses to the brain via the vestibular nerve. See also labyrinth.

A macula of the inner ear.





macular degeneration a group of conditions affecting the *macula lutea of the eye, resulting in a reduction or loss of central vision. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD, ARMD) is the most common cause of poor vision in the elderly. Two types are commonly recognized. Atrophic (or dry) AMD results from chronic choroidal ischaemia: small blood vessels of the choroid, which lies beneath the retina, become constricted, reducing the blood supply to the macula. This gives rise to degenerative changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; see retina), clinically recognized by macular pigmentation and the deposition of *drusen. Wet AMD is associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels underneath the retina, derived from the choroid (see neovascularization). These can leak fluid and blood beneath the retina, which further reduces the macular function. Nutritional supplements can delay the progression of AMD in some cases. Laser surgery (see photocoagulation; photodynamic therapy) and anti-VEGF therapy (see vascular endothelial growth factor) can delay progression in cases of wet AMD.

macule n. a flat (impalpable) circumscribed area of skin or an area of altered skin colour (e.g. a freckle). Compare papule.

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a diagnostic imaging technique based on the emission of electromagnetic waves from the body when the patient is placed in a strong magnetic field and exposed to radiofrequency radiation (see nuclear magnetic resonance). The strength of the magnetic field is measured in *teslas. Most images rely on the signal from hydrogen in water, which is particularly strong, although other elements with unpaired outer electrons can be used (see magnetic resonance spectroscopy). A major advantage over *computerized tomography is the lack of X-rays, which reduces exposure to ionizing radiation. MRI is used for the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment planning of a wide range of diseases and also to guide interventional radiological procedures. See also functional magnetic resonance imaging.

magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) a diagnostic technique that utilizes the phenomenon of *nuclear magnetic resonance to obtain a biochemical profile of tissues by exciting elements other than hydrogen in water and other body components.

malaria (ague, marsh fever, periodic fever, paludism) n. an infectious disease due to the presence of parasitic protozoa of the genus *Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, or P. vivax) within the red blood cells. The disease is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito and is confined mainly to tropical and subtropical areas.

Parasites in the blood of an infected person are taken into the stomach of the mosquito as it feeds. Here they multiply and then invade the salivary glands. When the mosquito bites an individual, parasites are injected into the bloodstream and migrate to the liver and other organs, where they multiply. After an incubation period varying from 12 days (P. falciparum) to 10 months (some varieties of P. vivax), parasites return to the bloodstream and invade the red blood cells. Rapid multiplication of the parasites results in destruction of the red cells and the release of more parasites capable of infecting other red cells. This causes a short bout of shivering, fever, and sweating, and the loss of healthy red cells results in anaemia. When the next batch of parasites is released symptoms reappear. The interval between fever attacks varies in different types of malaria: in quartan malaria (or fever), caused by P. malariae, it is three days; in tertian malaria (P. ovale or P. vivax) it is two days (these two types are known as benign malarias). In malignant (or falciparum) malaria (caused by P. falciparum) – the most severe kind – the interval between attacks varies from a few hours to two days (see also blackwater fever).

mania n. a state of mind characterized by excessive cheerfulness and increased activity. The mood is euphoric and can change rapidly to irritability. Thought and speech are pressured and rapid to the point of incoherence and the connections between ideas may be impossible to follow to the point of *loosening of associations. Behaviour is overactive, extravagant, overbearing, and sometimes aggressive. Excessive drug and alcohol use can complicate the picture. Judgment is impaired, with disinhibited behaviour, and therefore the patient may damage his or her own interests. There may be grandiose delusions. *Mixed affective states (such as low mood with pressured speech and irritability) are common. Treatment is usually with medication, such as lithium, *benzodiazepines, or *antipsychotics, and hospital admission is frequently necessary. See also bipolar affective disorder. —manic adj.

MAO inhibitor (MAOI) a drug that prevents the activity of the enzyme *monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO inhibitors include phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine. These drugs are irreversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, whose use as antidepressants is now restricted because of the severity of their side-effects. These include interactions with other drugs (e.g. ephedrine, phenylephrine) and with foods or drinks containing *tyramine (e.g. cheese or red wine) to produce a sudden and dangerous increase in blood pressure. *Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), with less severe side-effects. See also selegiline.

maple syrup urine disease (aminoacidopathy) an inborn defect of amino acid metabolism causing an excess of valine, leucine, isoleucine, and alloisoleucine in the urine, which has an odour like maple syrup. Treatment is dietary; if untreated, the condition leads to learning disabilities and death in infancy.

marasmus n. mixed deficiency of both protein and calories, resulting in severe wasting in infants. Body weight is below 60% of that expected for age, the infant looks ‘old’, has thin sparse hair, is pallid and apathetic, lacks skin fat, and has subnormal temperature. The condition may be due to *malabsorption, wrong feeding, metabolic disorders, repeated vomiting, diarrhoea, severe disease of the heart, lungs, kidneys, or urinary tract, or chronic bacterial or parasitic disease (especially in tropical climates). Maternal rejection of an infant may cause marasmus through undereating. Acute infection may precipitate death. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but initially very gentle nursing and the provision of nourishment and fluids by gradual steps is appropriate for all.

maraviroc n. an *antiretroviral drug (ARV) used, in combination with other ARVs, for treating refractory HIV infection.

mastectomy n. surgical removal of a breast. Simple mastectomy, performed for extensive but not necessarily invasive tumours, involves simple removal of the breast; the skin and if possible the nipple may be retained and a prosthesis (see breast implant) may be inserted under the skin to give the appearance of normality. When breast cancer has spread to involve the lymph nodes, radical mastectomy may be performed. This classically involves removal of the breast with the skin and underlying pectoral muscles together with all the lymphatic tissue of the armpit. This treatment may be followed up with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. In modern surgical practice a modified radical mastectomy, preserving the pectoral muscles, is more usual than the classical technique. See also lumpectomy.

mastication n. the process of crushing, grinding, and chewing food.

mastitis n. inflammation of the breast, usually caused by bacterial infection via damaged nipples. It most often occurs as acute puerperal mastitis, which develops during the period of breast-feeding, about a month after childbirth, and sometimes involves the discharge of pus. Chronic cystic mastitis has a different cause and does not involve inflammation. The breast feels lumpy due to the presence of cysts, and the condition is thought to be caused by hormone imbalance.

mastocytosis n. a condition caused by *mast cell proliferation due to KIT *proto-oncogene mutations. It most commonly manifests in the skin but also affects other organs. Maculopapular variants were formerly known as urticaria pigmentosa. Systemic involvement is common in adult cases, with bone marrow examination essential for accurate diagnosis. It may be associated with haematological abnormalities, including leukaemias. Resolution is common in children with skin involvement only. Treatment includes antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers (such as sodium *cromoglicate), and *tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

mastoidectomy n. an operation to remove some or all of the air cells in the bone behind the ear (the *mastoid process of the temporal bone) when they have become infected (see mastoiditis) or invaded by *cholesteatoma. See also atticotomy.

mastoiditis n. inflammation of the *mastoid process behind the ear and of the air space (mastoid antrum) connecting it to the cavity of the middle ear. It is usually caused by bacterial infection that spreads from the middle ear (see otitis). Usually the infection responds to antibiotics, but surgery (see mastoidectomy) may be required in severe cases.

mastoid process a nipple-shaped process on the *temporal bone that extends downward and forward behind the ear canal and is the point of attachment of several neck muscles. It contains many air spaces (mastoid cells), which communicate with the cavity of the middle ear via an air-filled channel, the mastoid antrum. This provides a possible route for the spread of infection from the middle ear (see mastoiditis).

maternal death deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy from any cause related to, or aggravated by, the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. These deaths can be subdivided into four main categories: (1) direct deaths: directly related to pregnancy; (2) indirect deaths: due to pre-existing maternal disease aggravated by pregnancy; (3) coincidental: unrelated to pregnancy; (4) late deaths: occurring between six weeks and one year following delivery. See also maternal mortality rate.

maternal mortality rate the number of deaths due to complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium per 100,000 live births (see also stillbirth). In 1952 concern about maternal mortality resulted in Britain in the setting up of a triennial *confidential enquiry into every such death to identify any shortfall in resources or care. The first triennial report was published in 1985. Since 2014 reports have been produced annually by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries Across the UK). Levels of *maternal deaths are currently low: a report published in 2017 (covering 2013–15) counted 202 obstetric-related deaths (8.76 per 100,000 live births). Thromboembolism was the commonest direct cause of death (30 deaths, 1.13 per 100,000 live births), while heart disease was the commonest indirect cause of death (54 deaths, 2.34 per 100,000 live births).

Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome (Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome, Müllerian agenesis) congenital absence of the uterus and upper part of the vagina due to failure of development of the *Müllerian duct. It may be associated with skeletal, renal, and auditory abnormalities, but usually presents with amenorrhoea in a patient with otherwise normal secondary sexual characteristics. There is a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, with psychological support, counselling, discussion of creation of a ‘neovagina’ with gradual use of vaginal dilators, and/or surgical vaginal reconstruction. Surrogacy is the only option for childbearing, although oocyte donation from the mother to a surrogate can be discussed. [K. W. Mayer (1795–1868), German gynaecologist; K. von Rokitansky (1804–78), Austrian pathologist; H. Küster and G. A. Hauser (20th century), German gynaecologists]

This results in fatigue, pain, and cramps in exercising muscles. The only treatment is avoidance of sustained or excessive exercise. [B. McArdle (20th century), British biochemist]

McBurney’s point the point on the abdomen that overlies the anatomical position of the appendix and is the site of maximum tenderness in acute appendicitis. It lies one-third of the way along a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine (the projecting part of the hipbone) to the umbilicus. [C. McBurney (1845–1913), US surgeon]

McCormick toy test a hearing test used in preschool children in which the child must discriminate between similar speech sounds. The test consists of 14 toys that are paired because their names sound similar; for example, tree and key, plane and plate. Having first identified all the objects, the child is then asked in a quiet voice to indicate a particular toy (e.g. Can you find the key?).

mean (arithmetic mean) n. the average of a group of observations calculated by adding their values and dividing by the number in the group. When one or more observations are substantially different from the rest, which can influence the arithmetic mean unduly, it is preferable to use the geometric mean (a similar calculation based on the logarithmic values of the observations) or – more commonly – the median (the middle observation of the series arranged in ascending order). A further method of obtaining an average or summary value for a group is to identify the mode – the observation (or group of observations when these occur as a continuous quantitative *variable) that occurs most often in the series.

measles n. a highly infectious virus disease that tends to appear in epidemics every 2–3 years and mainly affects children. After an incubation period of 8–15 days, symptoms resembling those of a cold develop accompanied by a high fever. Small red spots with white centres (Koplik’s spots) may appear on the inside of the cheeks. On the third to fifth day a blotchy slightly elevated pink rash develops, first behind the ears then on the face and elsewhere; it lasts 3–5 days. The patient is infectious throughout this period. In most cases the symptoms soon subside but patients are susceptible to pneumonia and middle ear infections. Complete recovery may take 2–4 weeks. Severe complications include encephalitis (one in 1000 cases) and *subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles is a common cause of childhood mortality in malnourished children, particularly in the developing world. Vaccination against measles provides effective immunity (see MMR vaccine).

The team will also assume the role of the *cardiac-arrest team.

medical ethics the standards of conduct required of medical professionals and also the academic study of ethical issues arising from the practice of medicine. From the *Hippocratic oath onwards, standards are designed to reassure that professionals subscribing to them will act in the *best interests of, and will avoid harming, their patients. Today they lay greater emphasis on patient *autonomy, while the contemporary study of medical ethics is concerned with a great variety of complex societal and social issues related to medical practice and research. Medical ethics is now taught in all medical schools in the UK as an essential part of a professional training, and the wider field of *bioethics is becoming a recognized academic specialty. See also clinical ethics; feminist ethics; public health ethics; publication ethics; virtue ethics.

mega- combining form denoting 1. large size, or abnormal enlargement or distension. Example: megacaecum (of the caecum). 2. a million. Example: megavolt (a million volts).

megacolon n. pathological dilatation of the colon. It is caused by chronic obstruction of the colon (e.g. due to *Hirschsprung’s disease) or longstanding constipation, or it may occur as a complication of *ulcerative colitis (toxic megacolon).

megadontia n. see macrodontia.

megakaryoblast n. a cell that gives rise to the platelet-forming cell *megakaryocyte, found in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow. It is derived from a *haemopoietic stem cell and matures via an intermediate stage (promegakaryocyte) into a megakaryocyte.

megakaryocyte n. a cell in the bone marrow that produces *platelets. It is large (35–160 μm in diameter), with an irregular multilobed nucleus, and with *Romanowsky stains its abundant cytoplasm appears pale blue with fine reddish granules. See also thrombopoiesis.

megal- (megalo-) combining form denoting abnormal enlargement. Example: megalomelia (of limbs).

megaloblast n. an abnormal form of any of the cells that are precursors of red blood cells (see erythroblast). Megaloblasts are unusually large and their nuclei fail to mature in the normal way; they are seen in the bone marrow in certain anaemias (megaloblastic anaemias) due to deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. —megaloblastic adj.

megalocephaly n. 1. see macrocephaly. 2. overgrowth and distortion of skull bones (see leontiasis).

megalocyte n. see macrocyte.

megalomania n. an obsolete word for delusions of grandeur, such as being God, royalty, etc. It may be a feature of a schizophrenic or manic illness.

-megaly combining form denoting abnormal enlargement. Example: splenomegaly (of spleen).

megaureter n. gross dilatation of the *ureter. This occurs above the site of a long-standing obstruction in the ureter, which blocks the free flow of urine from the kidney. A common cause of megaureter is reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureters (see vesicoureteric reflux), but some of the most striking examples are found in so-called idiopathic megaureter. In this condition, which may affect one or both ureters, there is a segment of normal ureter of varying length at the extreme lower end of the bladder, above which the ureter is enormously dilated. Both reflux and idiopathic megaureter can be complicated by urinary infection and/or renal impairment. Treatment of megaureter is by corrective surgery if functional obstruction can be demonstrated. Surgery for reflux is normally reserved for children with gross reflux distending the renal pelvis and is usually carried out in the first few months of life.

megestrol n. a synthetic female sex hormone (see progestogen) that is used mainly in the treatment of metastatic endometrial cancer.

meglitinides pl. n. a group of *oral hypoglycaemic drugs, including repaglinide and nateglinide, used for treating type 2 *diabetes mellitus. They act by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas and should be taken before each meal.

megophthalmia n. an abnormally large eyeball.

meibomian cyst n. see chalazion.

meibomian glands (tarsal glands) small sebaceous glands that lie under the conjunctiva of the eyelids.

meibomianitis n. inflammation of the *meibomian glands of the eyelids.

Meigs syndrome the rare combination of a benign ovarian *fibroma with *ascites and a right-sided pleural effusion. [J. V. Meigs (1892–1963), US gynaecologist]

meiosis (reduction division) n. a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each having half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. It occurs before the formation of sperm and ova and the normal (*diploid) number of chromosomes is restored after fertilization. Meiosis also produces genetic variation in the daughter cells, brought about by the process of *crossing over. Meiosis consists of two successive divisions, each divided into four stages (see prophase; metaphase; anaphase; telophase). (See illustration.) Compare mitosis. —meiotic adj.

Stages in meiosis.





Meissner’s plexus (submucous plexus) a fine network of parasympathetic nerve fibres in the wall of the alimentary canal, supplying the muscles and mucous membrane. [G. Meissner (1829–1905), German physiologist]

melaena n. black tarry faeces discoloured by the presence of digested blood. Melaena usually reflects significant bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but may be due to disease in the small bowel or proximal large bowel (such as carcinoma or *angiodysplasia). It may be associated with vomiting blood (*haematemesis) or *coffee-ground vomit. See also haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

melan- (melano-) combining form denoting 1. black coloration. 2. melanin. Example: melanaemia (the presence in the blood of melanin).

melancholia n. an obsolete name for *depression not triggered by any stressor. See also endogenous.

melanin n. a dark-brown to black pigment occurring in the hair, the skin, and in the iris and choroid layer of the eyes. Melanin is contained within special cells (chromatophores or melanophores) and is produced by the metabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. Production of melanin by melanocytes in the epidermis of the skin is increased by the action of sunlight (producing tanning), which protects the underlying skin layers from the sun’s radiation.

melanism (melanosis) n. an unusually pronounced darkening of body tissues caused by excessive production of the pigment *melanin. For example, melanism may affect the hair, the skin (after sunburn, during pregnancy, or in *Addison’s disease), or the eye.

melanocyte n. any one of the cells, concentrated within the epidermis of skin, that produces the dark brown pigment *melanin.

melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) a peptide hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. In humans it stimulates production and dispersal of melanin in the melanocytes. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which is released by neurons in the hypothalamus, suppresses appetite and regulates energy balance. It also stimulates sexual activity and is involved in regulation of heart rate and blood pressure.

melanoma (malignant melanoma) n. a highly malignant tumour of melanin-forming cells, the *melanocytes. Such tumours usually occur in the skin (pale skin, genetic predisposition, and excessive exposure to sunlight, particularly repeated sunburn, are the most important factors); it may arise from a pre-existing mole or naevus or from apparently normal skin. It can rarely occur at other sites than the skin. Melanomas are usually dark, but may also be free of pigment (amelanotic melanomas). Spread of this cancer to other parts of the body, especially to the lymph nodes and liver, is common if the original melanoma is thick. The prognosis is inversely related to the thickness of the tumour; almost all patients with tumours less than 0.76 mm survive following surgical excision. The mainstay of treatment is surgery, but melanoma can be responsive to *immunotherapy and is currently the subject of investigational treatments using melanoma vaccines; the response rate to conventional chemotherapy is poor. Primary prevention programmes reducing episodes of sunburn are advanced in some parts of the world, such as Australia.

melanonychia n. blackening of the nails with the pigment *melanin.

melanophore n. see melanin.

melanoplakia n. pigmented areas of *melanin in the mucous membrane lining the inside of the cheeks.

melanosis n. 1. see melanism. 2. a disorder in the body’s production of the pigment melanin. 3. *cachexia associated with the spread of the skin cancer *melanoma. —melanotic adj.

melanuria n. the presence of dark pigment in the urine. This may be caused by the presence of melanin or its precursors, in some cases of *melanoma; it may alternatively be caused by metabolic disease, such as *porphyria.

MELAS mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes: a rare metabolic disorder, usually inherited from the mother, that results in short stature and high levels of lactic acid in the blood (see lactic acidosis). Affected individuals are usually diagnosed in late childhood and early adult life. See also mitochondrial disorders.

melasma n. see chloasma.

melatonin n. a hormone produced by the *pineal gland in darkness but not in bright light. Melatonin receptors in the brain, in a nucleus immediately above the *optic chiasm, react to this hormone and synchronize the nucleus to the 24-hour day/night rhythm, thus informing the brain when it is day and when it is night. Melatonin is a derivative of *serotonin, with which it works to regulate the sleep cycle, and is being used experimentally to treat jet lag, *SAD, and insomnia in shift workers and the elderly.

melioidosis n. a disease of wild rodents caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas pseudomallei. It can be transmitted to humans, possibly by rat fleas, causing pneumonia, multiple abscesses, and septicaemia. It is often fatal.

Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome a rare disorder characterized by the occurrence together of facial paralysis, enlargement of the glottis, and swollen lips, which is due to lymphatic *stasis and the consequent build-up of protein in the facial tissues. [E. Melkersson (1898–1932), Swedish physician; C. Rosenthal (20th century), German neurologist]

melomelus n. a fetus with one or more pairs of supernumerary limbs.

melphalan n. a drug (an *alkylating agent) used to treat various types of cancer, particularly myeloma. Side-effects include digestive upsets, mouth ulcers, and temporary hair loss.

memantine hydrochloride an *NMDA-receptor antagonist drug indicated for treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s-type dementia. Its most common side-effects are dizziness, headache, and constipation.

membrane n. 1. a thin layer of tissue surrounding the whole or part of an organ or tissue lining a cavity, or separating adjacent structures or cavities. See also basement membrane; mucous membrane; serous membrane. 2. the lipoprotein envelope surrounding a cell (plasma or cell membrane). —membranous adj.

membrane bone a bone that develops in connective tissue by direct *ossification, without cartilage being formed first. The bones of the face and skull are membrane bones.

membranous labyrinth see labyrinth.

membranous nephropathy a common cause of the *nephrotic syndrome in adults. The diagnosis is established by renal biopsy, which shows diffuse global subepithelial deposits within the glomerulus. Most cases of membranous nephropathy are idiopathic, but there are associations with infection (e.g. hepatitis B), malignancy (especially lung cancer), autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE, Hashimoto’s disease), and drugs (e.g. gold and penicillamine). Recent studies suggest that idiopathic membranous nephropathy is an autoimmune disease with antibodies directed against an antigen (PLA2R, a phospholipase A2 receptor) on the *podocyte cell membrane. Without treatment, outcome is very variable: some patients will make a full recovery, while others will progress to end-stage kidney failure. Immunosuppressant treatment is often tried when there is evidence of declining renal function.

Memokath n. trade name for a nickel-titanium alloy prostatic *stent used as a minimally invasive treatment for men with *lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland) who are unfit for surgery. The stent is placed in the prostatic section of the urethra and bladder neck using a flexible cystoscope. The stent expands when warm water is passed through it; cold water causes contraction and allows removal. Less commonly this stent can be used in the ureter in the management of ureteric strictures.

memory cell a long-lived lymphocyte that is formed following primary infection. It enables a faster and more robust immune response following a second exposure to the antigen.

MEN multiple endocrine neoplasia. See MENS.

men- (meno-) combining form denoting menstruation.

MenACWY vaccine a vaccine that provides protection against four different strains (A, C, W, and Y) of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus) that causes *meningitis and septicaemia. It also prevents the carriage of the bacteria in the nose and back of the throat. In Britain it is offered to children aged 14 years and students going to college and university for the first time.

menarche n. the start of the menstrual periods and other physical and mental changes associated with puberty. The menarche occurs when the reproductive organs become functionally active and may take place at any time between 10 and 18 years of age. Compare gonadarche.

MENCAP a British voluntary association that promotes the welfare of people with learning disabilities and their families, through education, campaigning, and the provision of resources for projects.

mendelism n. the theory of inheritance based on *Mendel’s laws.

Mendel’s laws rules of inheritance based on the breeding experiments of the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel (1822–84), which showed that the inheritance of characteristics is controlled by particles now known as *genes. In modern terms they are as follows. (1) Each body (somatic) cell of an individual carries two factors (genes) for every characteristic and each gamete carries only one. It is now known that the genes are arranged on chromosomes, which are present in pairs in somatic cells and separate during gamete formation by the process of *meiosis. (2) Each pair of factors segregates independently of all other pairs at meiosis, so that the gametes show all possible combinations of factors. This law applies only to genes on different chromosomes; those on the same chromosome are affected by *linkage. See also dominant; recessive.

Mendelson’s syndrome inhalation of regurgitated stomach contents by an anaesthetized patient, which may result in death from anoxia or cause extensive lung damage or pulmonary *oedema with severe *bronchospasm. It is a well-recognized hazard of general anaesthesia in obstetrics and may be prevented by giving gastric-acid inhibitors (e.g. *cimetidine or *ranitidine) or sodium citrate before inducing anaesthesia. [C. L. Mendelson (1913–2002), US obstetrician]

Ménétrier’s disease a rare disorder caused by *hypertrophy of the mucosa. It is characterized by diffusely enlarged gastric folds and excess mucus production, leading to anaemia, protein loss, and peripheral oedema. [P. Ménétrier (1859–1935), French physician]

Ménière’s disease a disease of the inner ear characterized by episodes of deafness, buzzing in the ears (*tinnitus), and *vertigo. Typically the attacks are preceded by a sensation of fullness in the ear. Symptoms last for several hours and between attacks the affected ear may return to normal, although hearing does tend to deteriorate gradually with repeated attacks. It is thought to be caused by the build-up of fluid in the inner ear. Drug treatments include *prochlorperazine to reduce vertigo in acute attacks and *betahistine as prophylactic treatment. *Transtympanic injections of steroids into the middle ear are sometimes utilized. Alternatively, ototoxic drugs, such as *gentamicin, can be injected through the eardrum into the middle ear to deliberately damage the *vestibular apparatus and hence reduce activity in the inner ear. Surgical procedures used include decompression or drainage of the *endolymphatic sac, *vestibular nerve section, and *labyrinthectomy. Medical name: endolymphatic hydrops. [P. Ménière (1799–1862), French physician]

mening- (meningo-) combining form denoting the meninges.

meninges pl. n. (sing. meninx) the three connective tissue membranes that line the skull and vertebral canal and enclose the brain and spinal cord (see illustration). The outermost layer – the *dura mater (pachymeninx) – is inelastic, tough, and thicker than the middle layer (the *arachnoid mater) and the innermost layer (the *pia mater). The inner two membranes are together called the leptomeninges; between them circulates the *cerebrospinal fluid.

The meninges (in a section through the skull and brain).





meningioma n. a benign tumour arising from the fibrous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (*meninges). It is usually slow-growing and produces symptoms by pressure on the underlying nervous tissue. In the brain the tumour may cause focal *epilepsy and gradually progressive neurological disability. In the spinal cord it may cause paraplegia and the *Brown-Séquard syndrome. Rarely, meningiomas may behave in a malignant fashion and can invade neighbouring tissues. Treatment of the majority of cases is by surgical removal if the tumour is accessible. The histological classification of malignancy is controversial, but some tumours may also require additional radiotherapy. Some patients have been known to have symptoms for as long as 30 years before the tumour has been discovered.

meningism n. stiffness of the neck that is found in *meningitis.

meningitis n. an inflammation of the *meninges due to infection by viruses or bacteria or fungi. Meningitis causes an intense headache, fever, loss of appetite, intolerance to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia), rigidity of muscles, especially those in the neck (see also Kernig’s sign), and in severe cases convulsions, vomiting, and delirium leading to death. The most important causes of bacterial meningitis are *Haemophilus influenzae (especially in young children); two strains of Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus), B and C; and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal meningitis). Immunization against Haemophilus, Neisseria meningitidis B and C, and pneumococcal meningitis is now routine for children (see Hib vaccine; meningitis B vaccine; meningitis C vaccine; pneumococcal vaccine); In meningococcal meningitis (meningitis B and C, previously known as cerebrospinal fever and spotted fever) the symptoms appear suddenly and the bacteria can cause widespread meningococcal infection, which may be associated with meningococcal septicaemia, with its characteristic purple haemorrhagic rash anywhere on the body. The rash does not disappear on pressure (if a glass is pressed on the rash, it is still visible through the glass). Unless quickly diagnosed and treated, death can occur within a few hours.

Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics administered as soon as possible after diagnosis. With the exception of herpes simplex *encephalitis (which is treated with aciclovir), viral meningitis does not respond to drugs but normally has a relatively benign prognosis. See also leptomeningitis; pachymeningitis.

meningitis B vaccine (MenB) a vaccine that provides protection against the B strain of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus), which accounts for more than 90% of meningococcal infections in young children. The MenB vaccine is offered to all babies with their primary *immunizations at 2 and 4 months of age and as a booster at 12 months. See meningitis.

meningitis C vaccine (MenC) a vaccine that provides protection against the C strain of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus), which accounts for approximately 50% of all cases of meningococcal meningitis and tends to occur in clusters. Owing to the success of the MenC vaccination programme begun in 1999 there have been almost no recent cases of meningitis C disease in babies and young children in the UK. The vaccine was previously offered to all babies at 12 weeks of age but is now given at 12 months as part of Hib/MenC vaccine and at 14 years as the MenACWY vaccine.

meningocele n. see neural tube defects.

meningococcaemia n. the presence of meningococci (bacteria of the species Neisseria meningitidis) in the bloodstream. See meningitis.

meningococcus n. (pl. meningococci) the bacterium *Neisseria meningitidis, which can cause a serious form of septicaemia and is a common cause of *meningitis. —meningococcal adj.

meningoencephalitis n. inflammation of the brain and its membranous coverings (the meninges) caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or amoebic infection. The disease may also involve the spinal cord, producing *myelitis with paralysis of both legs, sometimes called meningoencephalomyelitis.

meningoencephalocele n. see neural tube defects.

meningoencephalomyelitis n. see meningoencephalitis.

meningomyelocele n. see neural tube defects.

meningovascular adj. relating to or affecting the meninges covering the brain and spinal cord and the blood vessels that penetrate them to supply the underlying neural tissues. The term is also used to describe tertiary syphilitic infection of the nervous system.

meninx n. 1. the thin layer of mesoderm that surrounds the brain of the embryo. It gives rise to most of the skull and the membranes that surround the brain. See also chondrocranium. 2. see meninges.

meniscectomy n. surgical removal of a cartilage (meniscus) in the knee. This is carried out when the meniscus has been torn or is diseased and is causing symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and ‘locking’ of the knee joint. The operation is now routinely performed using an *arthroscope.

meniscus n. (in anatomy) a crescent-shaped structure, such as the fibrocartilaginous disc that divides the cavity of a synovial joint.

Menkes kinky-hair disease a genetic disorder characterized by severe learning disabilities, seizures, poor vision, colourless fragile hair, and chubby red cheeks. It is inherited as an X-linked (see sex-linked) recessive characteristic. There is no treatment and affected infants usually die before the age of three. [J. H. Menkes (1928–2008), US neurologist]

menopause (climacteric) n. the time in a woman’s life when the ovaries cease to produce an egg cell every four weeks: menstruation ceases and the woman is no longer able to bear children. The menopause can occur at any age between the middle thirties and the middle fifties, most commonly between 45 and 55 (the median age is 51). Natural menopause can only be established in retrospect after 12 consecutive months of *amenorrhoea. Around the time of the menopause (the perimenopause) there are marked changes in the menstrual cycle. Menstruation may decrease gradually in successive periods or the intervals between the periods may lengthen; alternatively there may be a sudden and complete stoppage of the periods. There is a change in the balance of sex hormones in the body, which sometimes leads to hot flushes and other *vasomotor symptoms, palpitations, and dryness of the mucous membrane lining the vagina. Some women may also experience emotional disturbances. Some of these symptoms may be alleviated by *hormone replacement therapy. The term ‘menopause’ is also used for the postmenopausal period. See also postmenopausal bleeding. —menopausal adj.

menorrhagia n. abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation, which may or may not be associated with abnormally long periods. Menorrhagia may be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, tumours (especially fibroids) in the pelvic cavity, endometriosis, or the presence of an IUCD. In some cases no obvious pathology can be demonstrated; heavy, prolonged, or frequent uterine bleeding not associated with pelvic or systemic disease is known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Medical treatment for menorrhagia includes *NSAIDs, *antifibrinolytic drugs, and hormonal therapy, such as progestogen-only pills, gonadorelin analogues, or the *IUS (Mirena). Surgical treatments include *endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. In some extreme cases a blood transfusion may be necessary.

MENS multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, designated as type 1 (Wermer’s syndrome), type 2A (Sipple’s syndrome), and type 2B. These involve tumour formation or hyperplasia in various combinations of endocrine glands. Type 1 involves the parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas, whereas type 2A involves the thyroid medullary cells, the adrenal medulla (*phaeochromocytoma), and the parathyroids. Type 2B is similar to 2A, but patients tend to resemble people with *Marfan’s syndrome and have multiple *neuromas on their mucous membranes. These conditions are inherited as autosomal *dominant characteristics.

menses n. 1. the blood and other materials discharged from the uterus at menstruation. 2. see menstruation.

menstrual cycle the periodic sequence of events in sexually mature nonpregnant women by which an egg cell (ovum) is released from the ovary at four-weekly intervals until *menopause. The stages of the menstrual cycle are shown in the diagram. An ovum develops within a *Graafian follicle in the ovary. When mature, it bursts from the follicle and travels along the Fallopian tube to the uterus. A temporary endocrine gland – the corpus luteum – develops in the ruptured follicle and secretes the hormone *progesterone, which causes the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to become thicker and richly supplied with blood in preparation for pregnancy. If the ovum is not fertilized the cycle continues: the corpus luteum shrinks and the endometrium is shed at *menstruation. If fertilization does take place the fertilized ovum becomes attached to the endometrium and the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone, i.e. pregnancy begins.

The menstrual cycle.





menstruation (menses) n. the discharge of blood and of fragments of *endometrium from the vagina at intervals of about one month in women of child-bearing age (see menarche; menopause). Menstruation is that stage of the *menstrual cycle during which the endometrium, thickened in readiness to receive a fertilized egg cell (ovum), is shed because fertilization has not occurred. The normal duration of discharge varies from three to seven days. In anovular menstruation, discharge takes place without previous release of an egg cell from the ovary. Vicarious menstruation is bleeding from a mucous membrane other than the endometrium when normal menstruation is due. Retrograde menstruation is the backflow of blood and endometrial cells through the Fallopian tubes (see endometriosis). See also amenorrhoea; dysmenorrhoea; menorrhagia; oligomenorrhoea.

mental1 adj. relating to or affecting the mind.

mental2 adj. relating to the chin.

mental age a measure of the intellectual level at which an individual functions; for example, someone described as having a mental age of six years would be functioning at the level of an average six-year-old child. This measure has largely been replaced by a comparison of the functioning of persons of the same age group (see intelligence quotient; intelligence test).

Mental Capacity Act 2005 legislation for England and Wales, which came into force in October 2007, to govern the treatment of people who lack *capacity to make decisions. It gives legal force to the importance of *autonomy in health care and to *advance directives, decisions, or statements. It also provides statutory legislation for medical and social decision-makers to act in the patient’s best interests should he or she lose capacity (see Independent Mental Capacity Advocate). It allows proportionate force to implement decisions made in a patient’s best interests. For Scotland the current legislation is the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.

mental handicap a former term for *learning disability.

Mental Health Act an Act of Parliament to govern the treatment of people with a mental disorder, which is defined as including *mental illness, *personality disorder, and *learning disability. For England and Wales the Mental Health Act 1983 has been amended by the Mental Health Act 2007. The legislation provides for the voluntary and compulsory (involuntary) assessment and treatment of patients with a diagnosis or symptoms of a mental disorder. The purposes of involuntary admission are both to act in patients’ best interests, providing treatment for them when they have lost *insight into their illness, and to manage the risk that may arise from a mental disorder to the patients themselves or to others. One of the principal amendments in the 2007 Act is the introduction of Community Treatment Orders, which provide for the involuntary treatment of patients who have left hospital. Another, more controversial, change was the introduction of *sexual deviancy as a mental disorder to which the Act applies. In Scotland the current legislation is the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which came into effect in April 2005. See section.

Mental Health Act Commission a regulating body in England and Wales, governed by the Mental Health Act 2007, that was responsible for regularly visiting psychiatric hospitals, reviewing psychiatric care, giving second opinions on the need for certain psychiatric treatments, and acting as a forum for the discussion of psychiatric issues. It was subsumed under the *Care Quality Commission in April 2009.

Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT) a tribunal, established under the Mental Health Act 1959 and now operating under the Mental Health Act 2007, to which applications may be made for the discharge from hospital of a person compulsorily detained there under provisions of the Act (see compulsory admission). When a patient is subject to a restriction order an application may only be made after his or her first six months of detention. The powers of the tribunal, which comprises both legally and medically qualified members, include reclassifying unrestricted patients, recommending leave of absence for a patient, delaying discharge, and transferring patients to other hospitals. Detained patients may also apply to have a managers hearing to review their detention. The powers of the managers hearing are slightly different from those of the MHRT, but both are defined in the Mental Health Act 2007 and both can discharge a patient from a section of the Mental Health Act.

mental illness a disorder of one or more of the functions of the mind (such as mood, affect, perception, memory, or thought), which causes suffering to the patient or others. Symptoms of mental illness may be dimensional and only become pathological if at the severe end of the spectrum. Some mental illnesses are syndromes, which are characterized by a set of different symptoms that rarely all happen at once.

Mental illness should be distinguished from *learning disability, in which an individual has a general failure of development of the normal intellectual capacities. Mental illnesses are broadly divided into disorders in which the capacity for appreciating reality is lost (see psychosis) and those in which it is preserved (see neurosis).

mental impairment (mostly in legal usage) the condition of significant or severe impairment of intellectual and social functioning.

mental retardation formerly, the state of those whose intellectual powers have failed to develop to such an extent that they are in need of care and protection and require special education. The preferred term is now *learning disability.

mental state examination (MSE) a full psychiatric examination of signs and symptoms, which takes place during a psychiatric interview and should apply only to signs and symptoms elicited at that time; it should not take into account historical information. The examination is usually divided into the following subheadings: appearance and behaviour, speech, mood, *affect, thought and perception, *insight, and orientation. Usually it also includes a *risk assessment.

mento- combining form denoting the chin.

mentum n. the chin.

mepacrine n. a drug sometimes used to treat giardiasis. Digestive upsets and headache may occur and the skin often turns yellow.

meralgia paraesthetica painful tingling and numbness felt over the lateral surface of the thigh when the lateral cutaneous nerve is trapped as it passes through the fibrous and muscular tissues of the groin. It is usually found in pregnant women.

mercaptoacetyltriglycine n. see MAG3.

mercaptopurine n. a drug that prevents the growth of cancer cells; it is used chiefly in the treatment of acute leukaemias and chronic myeloid leukaemia but also in severe Crohn’s disease (see antimetabolite). It commonly reduces the numbers of white blood cells; mouth ulcers and digestive upsets may also occur.

mercurialism (hydrargyria) n. mercury poisoning. Metallic mercury is absorbed through the skin and alimentary canal, and its vapour is taken in through the lungs. Acute poisoning causes vomiting, severe abdominal pains, bloody diarrhoea, and kidney damage, with failure to produce urine. Treatment is with *chelating agents. Chronic poisoning causes mouth ulceration, loose teeth, loss of appetite, and intestinal and renal disturbances, with anaemia and nervous irritability. Treatment is removing the patient from further exposure.

mercury n. a silvery metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Its toxicity caused a decline in the use of its compounds in medicine during the 20th century; mercurial compounds were formerly used in the treatment of syphilis and as purgatives, teething pastes and powders, fungicides, and antiparasitic agents. Mercury is still widely used in dentistry as a component of *amalgam fillings; when the mercury is combined with the filling alloy, it is nontoxic. Symbol: Hg. See also mercurialism; pink disease.

merocrine (eccrine) adj. describing a type of *secretion in which the glandular cells remain intact during the process of secretion.

merozoite n. a stage in the life cycle of the malaria parasite (*Plasmodium). Many merozoites are formed during the asexual division of the schizont (see schizogony). The released merozoites may invade new red blood cells or new liver cells, and continue the asexual phase with the production of yet more merozoites, effectively spreading the infection. Alternatively, merozoites invade red blood cells and begin the sexual cycle with the formation of male and female sex cells (see microgametocyte; macrogametocyte).

MERS see Middle East respiratory syndrome.

mes- (meso-) combining form denoting middle or medial.

MESA (microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration) the removal of spermatozoa from the epididymis by needle *aspiration. This procedure, performed under anaesthetic, may be undertaken to assist conception in cases where the normal passage of sperm from the testis is obstructed, for example by blockage (through infection) of the ducts or by vasectomy. The extracted sperm are subjected to special treatment to select the strongest and most motile; these are then chemically treated to activate them and used for in vitro fertilization (see ICSI).

mesalazine n. see aminosalicylates.

mesangial cells see juxtaglomerular apparatus.

mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) a renal disease characterized by changes in the glomeruli with mesangial cell proliferation and thickening of the capillary wall (see juxtaglomerular apparatus). Three types are distinguished. Type 1 is associated with immune deposits in the subendothelial space and the mesangial cells, and may sometimes be associated with cryoglobulinaemia (see cryoglobulin) and infection with the hepatitis C virus. Type 2, also known as dense deposit disease, is associated with a ribbon of electron-dense material within the glomerular basement membrane. Type 3 is associated with immune deposits in the subendothelium, the basement membrane, and the subepithelial spaces.

The occurrence of pleural mesothelioma is often due to exposure to asbestos dust (see asbestosis), and workers in the asbestos industry who develop such tumours are entitled to industrial compensation. In other cases there is no history of direct exposure to asbestos at work but the patients had been exposed to asbestos via the clothes of relatives who had had direct contact with asbestos, or they themselves had lived very close to an asbestos factory. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but moderately good results have occasionally been obtained from radical surgery for limited disease, from radiotherapy, and more recently from chemotherapy.

It is lined with mucous membrane and is connected to the pharynx by the *Eustachian tube and to the outer ear by the eardrum (*tympanic membrane). Within the middle ear are three bones – the auditory *ossicles – which transmit sound vibrations from the outer ear to the inner ear (see labyrinth).

middle ear myoclonus spontaneous involuntary rhythmical contraction of the stapedius and/or tensor tympani muscles in the middle ear that can give rise to a form of *pulsatile tinnitus.

middle ear reflex involuntary contraction of the stapedius and/or tensor tympani muscles in the middle ear in response to various stimuli. The stapedius contracts in response to sound (see stapedial reflex). The tensor tympani is thought to contract during chewing. The sound-evoked middle ear reflex can be detected using a *tympanometer.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) a viral respiratory infection that was first identified in 2012. Humans seem to be infected most easily by contact with dromedary camels (hence the informal name camel flu), although human-to-human infection also occurs. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Although the syndrome is often mild, death occurs in about a third of diagnosed cases. Most reported cases have been in the Arabian Peninsula, although there was a major outbreak in South Korea in 2015. At present there is no vaccine or treatment.

midgut n. the middle portion of the embryonic gut, which gives rise to most of the small intestine and part of the large intestine. Early in development it is connected with the *yolk sac outside the embryo via the *umbilicus.

midstream specimen of urine (MSU) a specimen of urine that is subjected to examination for the presence of microorganisms. In order to obtain a specimen that is free of contamination, the periurethral area is cleansed and the patient is requested to discard the initial flow of urine before collecting the specimen in a sterile container.

midwifery n. the profession of providing assistance and medical care to women undergoing labour and childbirth during the antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. See also community midwife; obstetrics. —midwife n.

mifepristone n. a drug used to produce a medical abortion; it acts by blocking the action of *progesterone, which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. It is taken by mouth, followed after 36–48 hours by *gemeprost or *misoprostol intravaginally. Side-effects include faintness, headache, and vaginal bleeding.

migraine n. a neurovascular disorder in a genetically predisposed individual. There is an instability within the brainstem that is triggered by a variety of stimuli (e.g. foods, light, stress) and results in a recurrent throbbing headache that characteristically affects one side of the head. The patient sometimes has forewarning of an attack (an aura) consisting of visual disturbance or tingling and/or weakness of the limbs, which clear up as the headache develops. It is often accompanied by prostration, nausea and vomiting, and *photophobia. Effective preventive medication (e.g. beta blockers and some antiepileptic drugs) is available for patients with frequent migraine attacks, and *5HT1 agonists may be used to treat acute attacks. See also cluster headache.

Mikulicz’s disease swelling of the lacrimal and salivary glands as a result of infiltration with *lymphoid tissue. [J. von Mikulicz Radecki (1850–1905), Polish surgeon]

Milan criteria criteria used to select patients with cirrhosis and *hepatoma for liver transplantation. Transplantation can be considered if patients have a single tumour under 5 cm in size, or no more than three tumours that are less than 3 cm in size, and show no evidence of extrahepatic symptoms and no vascular invasion.

mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cognitive impairment beyond that expected for age and education that does not interfere with normal daily function. When memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed amnestic MCI and is frequently seen as an early stage of *Alzheimer’s disease. However, other aspects of cognition can be affected and symptoms can be stable or even remit.

miliaria rubra see prickly heat.

miliary adj. describing or characterized by very small nodules or lesions, resembling millet seed.

miliary tuberculosis acute generalized *tuberculosis characterized by lesions in affected organs, which resemble millet seeds.

milium n. (pl. milia) a white nodule in the skin, particularly on the face. Up to 2 mm in diameter, milia are tiny *keratin cysts occurring just beneath the outer layer (epidermis) of the skin. Milia are commonly seen in newborn babies around the nose; they may disappear without active treatment. In adults they may be lifted out with a needle or removed by an abrasive sponge.

milk n. the liquid food secreted by female mammals from the mammary gland. It is the sole source of food for the young of most mammals at the start of life. Milk is a complete food in that it has most of the nutrients necessary for life: protein, carbohydrate, fat, minerals, and vitamins. The composition of milk varies very much from mammal to mammal. Cows’ milk contains nearly all the essential nutrients but is comparatively deficient in vitamins C and D. Human milk contains more sugar (lactose) and less protein than cows’ milk. Many non-dairy milks are now available based on rice, almonds, and soya, many of which are fortified with *calcium.

milk formulas see Appendix 12.

milk rash a spotty red facial rash that is common during the first few months of life; it disappears without treatment.

milk teeth a colloquial name for the *primary teeth of children. See also dentition.

Minamata disease a form of mercury poisoning (from ingesting methyl mercury in contaminated fish) that caused 43 deaths in the Japanese coastal town of Minamata during 1953–56. The source of mercury was traced to an effluent containing mercuric sulphate from a local PVC factory. Symptoms include numbness, difficulty in controlling the limbs, and impaired speech and hearing.

MIND a voluntary association, registered as a charity that promotes the welfare of those with *mental illness through advice, education, campaigning, and the provision of resources. It was founded in 1946 as the National Association for Mental Health.

mineralocorticoid n. see corticosteroid.

minim n. a unit of volume used in pharmacy, equivalent to one sixtieth part of a fluid *drachm.

minimal change nephropathy the commonest cause of *nephrotic syndrome in children and an important cause of this syndrome in adults. The condition is so named because of the apparent lack of abnormalities seen on light microscopy of biopsy samples. Changes can, however, be seen on electron microscopy, with effacement of the *podocyte foot processes along the glomerular basement membrane. It is postulated that minimal change disease is a T-cell disease and that *cytokine damage to the podocytes leads to loss of the selective filtering characteristics of the glomerulus. The condition usually responds to corticosteroids and has a good prognosis, but there is clinical overlap with primary *focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which may have similar histological appearances in its early stages, tends not to respond to steroids, and is associated with a poor renal prognosis.

minimally conscious state (MCS) a disorder of consciousness distinct from *persistent vegetative state (PVS) and locked-in syndrome (see vegetative state). Unlike PVS, patients with MCS have partial preservation of conscious awareness although the level of awareness frequently fluctuates over time.

minimally invasive surgery (minimal-access surgery) surgical intervention involving the least possible physical trauma to the patient, particularly surgery performed using an operating laparoscope or other endoscope (see laparoscopy) passed through tiny incisions; it is known popularly as keyhole surgery. Several types of abdominal surgery, including gall bladder removal (see cholecystectomy) and extracorporeal shock-wave *lithotripsy for stones in the urinary or bile drainage system, are commonly performed in this way. Such methods are usually more comfortable and allow the patient to resume normal activity much sooner than would be possible after more conventional procedures. See also interventional radiology.

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) a brief 30-point questionnaire that is used to screen for cognitive impairment in the diagnosis of dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document response to treatment. It tests functions including arithmetic, memory, and orientation.

minitracheostomy n. temporary *tracheostomy using a needle or fine-bore tube inserted through the skin.

minocycline n. a *tetracycline antibiotic active against a wide range of bacteria, including Chlamydia, Borrelia, meningococcus, rickettsiae, and mycoplasmas. Side-effects include loss of appetite, skin rash, and dizziness.

minoxidil n. a peripheral vasodilator used in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) when other drugs are not effective; it is administered in conjunction with a diuretic and a beta blocker. Side-effects include ECG changes and transient oedema. It is also applied to the scalp to restore hair growth.

mio- combining form denoting 1. reduction or diminution. 2. rudimentary.

miosis (myosis) n. constriction of the pupil. This occurs normally in bright light. It is also seen in *Horner’s syndrome, but persistent miosis is most commonly caused by certain types of eye drops used to treat glaucoma. See also miotic. Compare mydriasis. —miotic adj.

miotic 1. n. a drug that causes the pupil of the eye to contract by constricting the ciliary muscle (see ciliary body). Miotics, such as *pilocarpine, are used to reduce the pressure in the eye in the treatment of glaucoma: contraction of the ciliary muscle increases the angle between the iris and cornea through which aqueous humour drains from the eye. 2. adj. showing *miosis.

MIP see maximum intensity projection.

miracidium n. (pl. miracidia) the first-stage larva of a parasitic *fluke. Miracidia hatch from eggs released into water with the host’s excreta. They have *cilia and swim about until they reach a snail. The miracidia then bore into the snail’s soft tissues and there continue their development as *sporocysts.

miscarriage n. spontaneous loss of pregnancy before 24 weeks, formerly known as spontaneous abortion. In threatened miscarriage there is vaginal bleeding (often minimal) associated with mild period-type pains; the cervix is closed and ultrasound confirms a viable pregnancy. In inevitable miscarriage, vaginal bleeding is associated with crampy pelvic pains and an open cervix; the pregnancy has not yet been expelled, but eventually will be. The miscarriage is incomplete if the cervix remains open and the uterus still contains some fetal tissue (which may need to be removed to prevent further haemorrhage). The miscarriage is complete if the cervix has closed and ultrasound scanning shows an empty uterus. Failure of a nonviable fetus to be expelled from the uterus is called a silent (or missed) miscarriage. A late miscarriage is one occurring after 20–24 weeks when the fetus has shown no signs of life after delivery. Recurrent miscarriage is the loss of three or more pregnancies consecutively; there are many possible causes, including *antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

miso- combining form denoting hatred. Example: misopedia (of children).

misophonia n. dislike of or aversion to particular sounds, irrespective of the level of that sound. See hyperacusis, phonophobia.

misoprostol n. a *prostaglandin drug administered in the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer, especially when caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see NSAID), in which case it is given in conjunction with the NSAID (see diclofenac; naproxen). It is also used to terminate a pregnancy, being administered vaginally following *mifepristone. Possible side-effects include diarrhoea.

missed case a person with a communicable disease in whom the symptoms and signs are so minimal that either there is no request for medical assistance or the doctor fails to make the diagnosis. The patient usually has partial immunity to the disease, but since the infecting organisms are of normal virulence, nonimmune contacts can be affected with the full manifestations of the illness. The period of infectivity is confined to the shortened duration of the illness (in contrast to a *carrier, in whom the pathogen is present without necessarily causing any ill effect). Alternatively, the subject has had the disease but retains some of the pathogens (e.g. in the throat or bowel) and so acts as a continuing reservoir of infection.

Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (in the UK) an Act of Parliament restricting the use of dangerous drugs. These controlled drugs are divided into three classes: class A drugs (e.g. heroin, morphine and other potent opioid analgesics, cocaine, LSD) cause the most harm when misused; class B drugs include amphetamines, barbiturates, and cannabis, and class C drugs include most benzodiazepines and anabolic steroids. The Act specifies certain requirements for writing prescriptions for these drugs. The Misuse of Drugs (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997 and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 lay down who may supply controlled drugs and the rules governing their supply, prescription, etc.

mite n. a free-living or parasitic arthropod belonging to a group (Acarina) that also includes the *ticks. Most mites are small, averaging 1 mm or less in length. A mite has no antennae or wings, and its body is not divided into a distinct head, thorax, and abdomen. Medically important mites include the many species causing dermatitis (e.g. Dermatophagoides) and the harvest mite (see Trombicula), which transmits scrub typhus.

mitochondrial disorders a group of inherited conditions transmitted through mitochondrial DNA (see mitochondrion), which can affect any organ and can present at any age. Most of these conditions are very rare; examples of those that are less rare include *Leigh syndrome, congenital *lactic acidosis, *MELAS, and Pearson syndrome.

mitochondrion (chondriosome) n. (pl. mitochondria) a structure, occurring in varying numbers in the cytoplasm of every cell, that is the site of the cell’s energy production. Mitochondria contain *ATP and the enzymes involved in the cell’s metabolic activities, and also their own DNA; mitochondrial genes (which in humans encode 13 proteins) are inherited through the female line. Each mitochondrion is bounded by a double membrane, the inner being folded inwards to form projections (cristae). —mitochondrial adj.

mitogen n. any substance that can cause cells to begin division (*mitosis).

mitomycin an *anthracycline antibiotic that inhibits the growth of cancer cells. It causes severe marrow suppression but is of use in the treatment of stomach, breast, and bladder cancers.

mitosis n. a type of cell division in which a single cell produces two genetically identical daughter cells. It is the way in which new body cells are produced for both growth and repair. Division of the nucleus (karyokinesis) takes place in four stages (see prophase; metaphase; anaphase; telophase) and is followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) to form the two daughter cells (see illustration overleaf). Compare meiosis. —mitotic adj.

Stages in mitosis.





mitotic index the proportion of cells in a tissue that are dividing at a given time.

mitoxantrone n. an *anthracycline antibiotic used in the treatment of certain cancers, including metastatic breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Side-effects are usually mild.

mitral regurgitation (mitral incompetence) failure of the *mitral valve to close, allowing a reflux of blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the left atrium. It may be due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in which one or both valve leaflets flop back into the left atrium (also known as ‘floppy mitral valve’). It also results from chronic rheumatic scarring of the valve, or is secondary to left ventricular muscle damage. Its manifestations include breathlessness, atrial *fibrillation, embolism, enlargement of the left ventricle, and a systolic *murmur. Mild cases are symptomless and require no treatment, but in severe cases the affected valve should be repaired or replaced with an artificial one (mitral prosthesis).

mitral stenosis narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve: a result of chronic scarring that follows rheumatic fever. It may be seen alone or combined with *mitral regurgitation. The symptoms are similar to those of mitral regurgitation except that the patient has a diastolic *murmur. Mild cases need no treatment, but severe cases are treated by reopening the stenosis with an Inoue balloon passed to the heart through the venous system under X-ray control (percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty) or surgically by inserting an artificial valve (mitral prosthesis).

mitral valve (bicuspid valve) a valve in the heart consisting of two flaps (cusps) attached to the walls at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle. It allows blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricle, but prevents any backward flow.

mittelschmerz n. pain in the lower abdomen experienced about midway between successive menstrual periods, i.e. when the egg cell is being released from the ovary. See also menstrual cycle.

mixed affective state a state of disordered mood that combines elements of *mania and *depression; it is a common feature of *bipolar affective disorder. Symptoms include overactivity, flight of ideas, depressed mood, and suicidal *ideation.

mmHg a unit of pressure equal to 1 millimetre of mercury. 1 mmHg = 133.3224 pascals.

MMR vaccine a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and German measles (rubella). It is currently recommended that this vaccine is given to all children at 12 months of age with a booster dose at 3 years 4 months of age or soon after (see immunization). Specific contraindications include immunosuppression and allergy to eggs. Claims of a link between the vaccine and autism and Crohn’s disease have been investigated and no credible evidence for such a relationship has been found.

moclobemide n. an antidepressant drug that reversibly inhibits the enzyme *monoamine oxidase A. The adverse effects of irreversible *MAO inhibitors, which include severe hypertensive reactions when cheese or other tyramine-containing foods are eaten by patients taking them, are less likely with reversible inhibitors. Moclobemide is used to treat major depression and social anxiety disorder.

modality n. 1. a form of sensation, such as smell, hearing, tasting, or detecting temperature. Differences in modality are not due to differences in the structure of the nerves concerned, but to differences in the working of the sensory receptors and the areas of brain that receive the messages. 2. one form of therapy as opposed to another, such as the modality of physiotherapy contrasted with that of radiotherapy.

mode n. see mean.

Modecate n. see fluphenazine.

modelling n. 1. a technique used in *behaviour modification, whereby an individual learns a behaviour by observing someone else doing it.

MOF multi-organ failure. See multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Mohs’ micrographic surgery a surgical technique used for removing primarily high-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers, particularly basal cell carcinoma. The technique allows the surgeon to see beyond the visible tumour as the specimen is removed and the histology checked in stages. At each stage, if the tumour involves the margins, further tissue is resected until they are clear. There is an extremely high cure rate. [F. E. Mohs (1910–2002), US surgeon]

molar n. a large grinding tooth at the back of the mouth. In the permanent *dentition, the sixth, seventh, and eighth teeth from the midline on each side in each jaw (see also wisdom tooth). Permanent molars do not replace primary teeth. In the primary dentition, molars are the fourth and fifth teeth from the midline on each side in each jaw. Molars commonly have two or three roots.

molar–incisor hypomineralization a defect involving a deficiency in the mineralization of permanent first molar and incisor teeth during their maturation phase, thought to be due to a disturbance of development around the time of birth. It often presents in discolouration (yellow, brown, cream, or white depending on severity) and results in the affected teeth being more susceptible to decay.

molarity n. the strength of a solution, expressed as the weight of dissolved substance in grams per litre divided by its molecular weight, i.e. the number of moles per litre. Molarity is indicated as 0.1 M, 1 M, 2 M, etc.

mole1 n. the *SI unit of amount of substance, equal to the amount of substance that contains as many elementary units as there are atoms in 0.012 kilograms of carbon-12. The elementary units, which must be specified, may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, etc., or a specified group of such entities. One mole of a compound has a mass equal to its molecular weight expressed in grams. Symbol: mol.

mole2 n. a nonmalignant collection of pigmented cells in the skin. Moles are rare in infancy, increase in numbers during childhood and especially in adolescence, but decline in numbers in old age. They vary widely in appearance, being flat or raised, smooth or hairy. Changes in the shape, colour, etc., of moles in adult life should be investigated as this may be an early sign of malignant *melanoma. Medical name: pigmented naevus. See also atypical mole syndrome.

molecular biology the study of the molecules that are associated with living organisms, especially proteins and nucleic acids.

molecular imaging an emerging area of imaging that exploits recent developments of molecular and cell biology to create new markers. Most molecular imaging uses versions of these markers labelled with radioactive isotopes, which – after administration – are localized in the body and can be detected using such techniques as *positron emission tomography, *SPECT scanning, *magnetic resonance imaging, and optical imaging.

molluscum contagiosum a common disease of the skin, mainly affecting children. Characterized by papules less than 5 mm in diameter, each with a central depression, the disease is caused by a *poxvirus and is spread by direct contact. Untreated, the papules generally disappear in 6–9 months. Widespread molluscum contagiosum in an adult may be a sign of HIV infection.

Monitor’s remit was substantially expanded under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to include regulation of all providers of health-care services for the NHS. Monitor also set prices for NHS-funded care in partnership with *NHS England, protected essential health services for patients if an NHS provider entered financial difficulty, and held responsibilities for enabling *integrated care and preventing anticompetitive behaviour by health-care providers. In 2016 the functions of Monitor were transferred to a new organization, *NHS Improvement.

monoamine oxidase (MAO) an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of a large variety of monoamines, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Monoamine oxidase is found in most tissues, particularly the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, and exists in two forms in humans: monoamine oxidase A primarily breaks down noradrenaline and serotonin, whereas monoamine oxidase B primarily degrades dopamine. Drugs that act as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A may be used in the treatment of depression (see MAO inhibitor); monoamine oxidase B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson’s disease.

monochromat n. a person who is completely colour-blind. There are two types. The rod monochromat appears to have totally defective *cones: he or she has very poor visual acuity as well as the inability to discriminate colours. The cone monochromat has normal visual acuity: the cones appear to respond normally to light but to be completely unable to discriminate colours. It is possible in this case that the defect does not lie in the cones themselves but in the integration of the nerve impulses as they pass from the cones to the brain. Both types of colour blindness are probably inherited.

monochromatic adj. denoting radiation, especially light, of the same frequency or wavelength.

monoclonal antibody an antibody produced artificially from a cell *clone and therefore consisting of a single type of immunoglobulin. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusing antibody-forming lymphocytes from mouse spleen with mouse myeloma cells. The resulting hybrid cells multiply rapidly (like cancer cells) and produce the same antibody as their parent lymphocytes. In addition to their use in research, monoclonal antibodies are valuable diagnostic tools and have also been developed as pharmaceutical agents for treating a variety of conditions. For example, they are used in the detection and treatment of cancer, as each one recognizes different proteins on the surface of both malignant and benign cells. They can be used alone as monotherapy or to deliver drugs or radioactive materials (e.g. yttrium-90) directly to tumour cells.

monocular adj. relating to or used by one eye only. Compare binocular.

monocyte n. a variety of white blood cell, 16–20 μm in diameter, that has a kidney-shaped nucleus and greyish-blue cytoplasm (when treated with *Romanowsky stains). Its function is the ingestion of foreign particles, such as bacteria and tissue debris. There are normally 0.2–0.8 × 109 monocytes per litre of blood. —monocytic adj.

monodactylism n. the congenital absence of all but one digit on each hand and foot.

monodelusional disorder a condition marked by a persistent delusion not associated with any other *mental illness. It is often of a *paranoid or persecutory nature, but can have any delusional content. Treatment is often difficult because patients commonly lack insight and refuse to try medication. When compliance can be achieved, the majority of patients respond well to antipsychotic medication.

monogenic diabetes see maturity-onset diabetes of the young.

monoiodotyrosine n. an iodine-containing substance produced in the thyroid gland from which the *thyroid hormones are derived.

mononeuritis n. disease affecting a single peripheral nerve. Mononeuritis multiplex is the separate involvement of two or more nerves. See also peripheral neuropathy.

monorchism n. absence of one testis. This is usually due to failure of one testicle to descend into the scrotum before birth. The term is sometimes used for the condition in which one testicle has been removed surgically or destroyed by injury or disease. If the single testis is normal, no adverse effects result from the absence of the other.

monosaccharide n. a simple sugar having the general formula (CH2O)n. Monosaccharides may have between three and nine carbon atoms, but the most common number is five or six. Monosaccharides are classified according to the number of carbon atoms they possess. Thus trioses have three carbon atoms, tetroses four, pentoses five, and hexoses six. The most abundant monosaccharide is glucose (a hexose).

monosomy n. a condition in which there is one chromosome missing from the normal (*diploid) set. Compare trisomy. —monosomic adj.

morning sickness nausea and vomiting occurring during early pregnancy. In some women the symptoms disappear if a small amount of food is eaten before rising in the morning. Compare hyperemesis gravidarum.

Moro reflex (startle reflex) a primitive reflex seen in newborn babies in response to the stimulus of a sudden noise or movement: the baby will fling its arms and legs wide and will appear to stiffen; the arms and legs are then drawn back into flexion. The Moro reflex should disappear spontaneously by four months. Its presence beyond this age is suggestive of an underlying neurological disorder, such as cerebral palsy. [E. Moro (1874–1951), German paediatrician]

morphine n. a potent opioid analgesic (see opiate) used mainly to relieve severe and persistent pain, particularly in terminally ill patients; it also induces feelings of euphoria.

Intelligence is normal. [L. Morquio (1865–1935), Uruguayan physician; J. F. Brailsford (1888–1961), British radiologist]

mortality rate the incidence of death in the population in a given period. The annual mortality rate is the number of registered deaths in a year, multiplied by 1000 and divided by the population at the middle of the year. See also infant mortality rate; maternal mortality rate.

mortification n. see necrosis.

morula n. an early stage of embryonic development formed by *cleavage of the fertilized ovum. It consists of a solid ball of cells and is an intermediate stage between the zygote and *blastocyst.

mosaicism n. a condition in which the cells of an individual do not all contain identical chromosomes; there may be two or more genetically different populations of cells. Often one of the cell populations is normal and the other carries a chromosome defect such as *Down’s syndrome or *Turner’s syndrome. In affected individuals the chromosome defect is usually not fully expressed. —mosaic adj.

mosquito n. a small winged bloodsucking insect belonging to a large group – the *Diptera (two-winged flies). Its mouthparts are formed into a long proboscis for piercing the skin and sucking blood. Female mosquitoes transmit the parasites responsible for several major infectious diseases, such as *malaria. The mosquito-borne zika virus has recently been shown to cause *microcephaly. See Anopheles; Aëdes; Culex.

motile adj. being able to move spontaneously, without external aid: usually applied to a *microorganism or a cell (e.g. a sperm cell).

motilin n. a polypeptide hormone, secreted in the small intestine, that controls smooth muscle contractions in the stomach and small intestine, increasing gut motility and promoting the production of pepsin.

motion sickness (travel sickness) nausea, vomiting, and headache caused by motion during travel by sea, road, or air. The symptoms are due to overstimulation of the balance organs in the inner ear by repeated small changes in the position of the body and are aggravated by movements of the horizon. Sedative antihistamine drugs (see antiemetic) are effective in preventing motion sickness.

motivational interviewing a technique that combines psychiatric assessment with elements of problem-solving *psychotherapy. It is mostly used with patients who have substance misuse problems. The interviewer elicits the psychiatric history and the extent of the patient’s difficulties, gives educational information, and tries to motivate the patient to change his or her habits.

motor cortex the region of the *cerebral cortex that is responsible for initiating nerve impulses that bring about voluntary activity in the muscles of the body. It is possible to map out the cortex to show which of its areas is responsible for which particular part of the body. The motor cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere is responsible for muscular activity in the right side of the body.

motor nerve one of the nerves that carry impulses outwards from the central nervous system to bring about activity in a muscle or gland. Compare sensory nerve.

motor neuron one of the units (*neurons) that goes to make up the nerve pathway between the brain and an effector organ, such as a skeletal muscle. An upper motor neuron has a cell body in the brain and an axon that extends into the spinal cord, where it ends in synapses. It is thus entirely within the central nervous system. A lower motor neuron, on the other hand, has a cell body in the spinal cord or brainstem and an axon that extends outwards in a cranial or spinal motor nerve to reach an effector.

motor neuron disease (motor neurone disease, MND) a progressive degenerative disease of the motor system occurring in middle age and causing muscle weakness and wasting. It primarily affects the cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the motor nuclei in the brainstem, and the corticospinal fibres. There are three clinically distinct forms: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig’s disease), progressive muscular atrophy, and progressive bulbar palsy. Some forms of MND (5%) are familial (inherited). The drug *riluzole has been licensed for the treatment of MND with upper motor neuron involvement, but its benefits are limited.

mould n. any multicellular filamentous fungus that commonly forms a rough furry coating on decaying matter.

moulding n. the changing of the shape of an infant’s head during labour, due to movement of the bones of the skull, brought about by the pressures to which it is subjected when passing through the birth canal.

mountain sickness see altitude sickness.

mouth-to-mouth resuscitation a form of *artificial respiration (known informally as the ‘kiss of life’) performed on an individual who has stopped breathing. The nostrils are pinched shut, the head is placed in the *head-tilt, chin-lift position, a seal is formed between the mouths of the casualty and rescuer, and air is blown firmly and steadily into the lungs for intervals of around three seconds. The small but definite infection risk with this technique can be avoided by using a *pocket resuscitation mask. Mouth-to-nose resuscitation is a similar technique in which the breaths are delivered through the casualty’s nose.

mouthwash n. an aqueous solution used for rinsing of the mouth and teeth. Mouthwashes are used to prevent dental caries and gingivitis (see also chlorhexidine), to strengthen teeth against decay (see fluoride), and to treat mild throat infections.

mouthwash test a simple noninvasive procedure that enables the detection of *carriers for single gene defects, e.g. *cystic fibrosis. Epithelial cells from the buccal cavity are obtained from a saline mouthwash: from these it is possible to isolate DNA, which is amplified by the *polymerase chain reaction to enable gene analysis.

moxibustion n. a form of treatment favoured in Japan, in which cones of sunflower pith or down from the leaves of the plant Artemisia moxa are stuck to the skin and ignited. The heat produced by the smouldering cones acts as a counterirritant and is reputed to cure a variety of disorders.

mucilage n. (in pharmacy) a thick aqueous solution of a gum used as a lubricant in skin preparations (see also glycerin), for the production of pills, and for the suspension of insoluble substances. The most important mucilages are of acacia, tragacanth, and starch.

mucin n. the principal constituent of *mucus. Mucin is a *glycoprotein.

muco- combining form denoting 1. mucus. 2. mucous membrane.

mucociliary transport the process by which cilia (see cilium) move a thin film of *mucus from the upper and lower respiratory tracts towards the digestive tract. Particles of dust and microorganisms are trapped on the mucus and thereby removed from the respiratory tract.

mucocoele n. a space or organ distended with mucus. For example, it may occur in the gall bladder when the exit duct becomes obstructed so that the mucus secretions are retained and dilate the cavity of the organ. A mucocoele in the soft tissues arising from a salivary gland occurs when the duct is blocked or ruptured.

mucolytic n. an agent that dissolves or breaks down mucus. Mucolytics such as carbocisteine and dornase alfa (see DNAse) break down mucus in sputum and thus facilitate its expectoration; they are used to treat chest conditions involving excessive or thickened mucus secretions.

mucopolysaccharide n. one of a group of complex carbohydrates functioning mainly as structural components in connective tissue. Mucopolysaccharide molecules are usually built up of two repeating sugar units, one of which is an amino sugar. An example of a mucopolysaccharide is *chondroitin sulphate, occurring in cartilage.

mucopolysaccharidosis n. any one of a group of several rare genetic diseases that are *inborn errors of metabolism in which the storage of complex carbohydrates is disordered. The two most common are *Hunter’s syndrome and *Hurler’s syndrome.

mucoprotein n. one of a group of proteins found in the *globulin fraction of blood plasma. Mucoproteins are globulins combined with a carbohydrate group (an amino sugar). They are similar to *glycoproteins but contain a greater proportion of carbohydrate.

mucopurulent adj. containing mucus and pus. See mucopus.

mucopus n. a mixture of *mucus and *pus.

Mucor n. a genus of mould fungi commonly seen on dead and decaying organic matter. They can be pathogenic in humans.

mucormycosis n. infection caused by fungi of the genus *Mucor. It most commonly affects the sinuses, lungs, or brain in immunocompromised patients.

mucosa n. see mucous membrane. —mucosal adj.

mucous membrane (mucosa) the moist membrane lining many tubular structures and cavities, including the nasal sinuses, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, biliary, and pancreatic systems. The surface of the mouth is lined by mucous membrane, the nature of which varies according to its site. The mucous membrane consists of a surface layer of *epithelium, which contains glands secreting *mucus, with underlying layers of connective tissue (lamina propria) and muscularis mucosae, which forms the inner boundary of the mucous membrane.

mucoviscidosis n. see cystic fibrosis.

mucus n. a viscous fluid secreted by *mucous membranes. Mucus acts as a protective barrier over the membranes, a lubricant, and a carrier of enzymes. It consists chiefly of *glycoproteins, particularly mucin. —mucous, mucoid adj.

MUGA scan (multiple-gated acquisition scan) a technique used in *nuclear medicine for studying the left-ventricular function and wall motion of the heart. The patient’s red cells are labelled with radioactive technetium-99m. A gamma camera, connected to an ECG, collects information over a prolonged period for each phase of heart movement (ECG gating) to form an image of the blood pool within the heart at specific points in the cardiac cycle. Tomographic reconstructions can be made to give cross-sectional images of the heart in different phases of the cardiac cycle, using reconstruction *algorithms comparable to CT scanning (see SPECT scanning).

Müllerian duct (paramesonephric duct) either of the paired ducts that form adjacent to the Wolffian ducts (see mesonephros) in the embryo. In the female these ducts develop into the Fallopian tubes, uterus, and part of the vagina. In the male anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), produced by the fetal testis, arrests their development and by the tenth week of fetal life they have degenerated almost completely. In females AMH is produced by the ovary and levels are used as a measure of certain aspects of ovarian function, such as response to in vitro fertilization and assessing such conditions as polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, and intersex conditions in infants. [J. P. Müller (1801–58), German physiologist]

multidetector computerized tomography (MDCT) a development of *spiral CT scanning that uses more than one array of detectors opposite the X-ray tube, so that more tissue can be included, with thinner cuts, in a single rotation of the machine. This is particularly important for three-dimensional reconstruction of tissues. It also allows volumetric scanning or *isotropic imaging, which are best achieved when the thickness of the slice is similar to the size resolution of the detectors in the other two planes. Modern CT scanners are now usually equipped with between 16 and 640 detector arrays. The technique is particularly valuable for imaging fast-moving structures, such as the heart.

multidisciplinary team (MDT) a group of health-care professionals with different areas of expertise who unite to plan and carry out treatment of complex medical conditions.

multifactorial adj. describing a condition that is believed to have resulted from the interaction of genetic factors, usually polygenes, with an environmental factor or factors. Many disorders, e.g. spina bifida and anencephaly, are thought to be multifactorial.

multifocal lenses lenses containing more than one segment made to different prescriptions for visual correction. See bifocal lens; trifocal lenses.

multigravida n. a woman who has been pregnant at least twice.

multi-organ failure (MOF) see multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

multipara n. a woman who has given birth to a live child after each of at least two pregnancies. See also grand multiparity.

multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) a computer technique that allows images to be created, after the information has been collected (see post-processing), in any of the three named planes – *axial, *sagittal, or *coronal – or variations of these, such as oblique or curved planes. The effect is similar to allowing parts of the body to be sliced away, revealing the tissues inside so that they can be studied.

multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) see MENS.

multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS, multi-organ failure, multiple organ failure, MOF) a common cause of death following severe injury, overwhelming infection, or immune deficiency states.

multiple personality disorder a controversial diagnostic entity, in which the affected person is alleged to have two or more distinct, and often contrasting, personalities. As each personality assumes dominance, it determines attitudes and behaviour and usually appears to be unaware of the other personality (or personalities). Transition is sudden and the mental states of the different personalities are normal. The vast majority of psychiatrists deny its existence, and many other explanatory models exist for persons who occasionally show symptoms similar to those described above.

multiple sclerosis (MS, disseminated sclerosis) a chronic disease of the nervous system affecting young and middle-aged adults. The *myelin sheaths surrounding nerves in the brain and spinal cord are damaged, which affects the function of the nerves involved. The course of the illness is usually characterized by recurrent relapses followed by remissions, but a proportion of patients run a chronic progressive course. The disease affects different parts of the brain and spinal cord, resulting in typically scattered symptoms. These include unsteady gait and shaky movements of the limbs (ataxia), abnormal eye movements (e.g. *nystagmus and internuclear *ophthalmoplegia), defects in speech pronunciation (dysarthria), spastic weakness, and *retrobulbar neuritis. The underlying cause of the nerve damage remains unknown, but an autoimmune process may be involved. Steroid treatment may be used in an acute relapse. *Interferon beta and *glatiramer acetate given by regular self-administered injections reduce the relapse rate by 30% in some patients. Newer monoclonal antibody treatments are also available.

multiple system atrophy (MSA) a condition that results from degeneration of cells in the *basal ganglia (resulting in *parkinsonism), the *cerebellum (resulting in *ataxia), the *pyramidal system, and the *autonomic nervous system (resulting in symptoms of autonomic failure, such as postural hypotension).

multipotent adj. see stem cell.

multisystem adj. describing a disease that affects many systems of the body.

multivariate analysis see correlation.

mummification n. 1. the conversion of dead tissue into a hard shrunken mass, chiefly by dehydration. 2. (in dentistry) the application of a fixative to the dental pulp to prevent decomposition.

mumps n. a common virus infection mainly affecting school-age children. Symptoms appear 2–3 weeks after exposure: fever, headache, and vomiting may precede a typical swelling of the *parotid salivary glands. The gland on one side of the face often swells up days before the other but sometimes only one side is affected. The symptoms usually vanish within three days, the patient remaining infectious until the swelling has completely disappeared, but the infection may spread to other salivary glands and to the pancreas, brain (causing an aseptic meningitis), and testicles (after puberty mumps affecting the testicles can cause sterility). Vaccination against mumps provides effective immunity (see MMR vaccine). Medical name: infectious parotitis.

Munchausen’s syndrome (Münchhausen’s syndrome) a very rare mental disorder, first described by Richard Asher in 1951, in which the patient persistently feigns symptoms in order to obtain invasive hospital treatment, especially surgery. The symptoms may be described in vivid detail, and in some cases injury may be deliberately self-inflicted in an attempt to give the appearance of authenticity to the claims being made. In Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy the patient (usually a mother) presents false health information about someone else (usually her child) or inflicts harm on this other in order to attract medical attention. Munchausen’s syndrome is now often referred to as factitious disorder imposed on self and Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy as factitious disorder imposed on another. [Baron von Münchhausen, a character in German literature loosely based on the German nobleman Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–97), who told exaggerated stories]

murmur n. a noise, heard with the aid of a stethoscope, that is generated by turbulent blood flow within the heart or blood vessels. Turbulent flow is produced by damaged valves, *septal defects, narrowed arteries, or arteriovenous communications. Heart murmurs can also be heard in normal individuals, especially those who have hyperactive circulation, and frequently in normal children (innocent murmurs). Murmurs are classified as systolic or diastolic (heard in ventricular *systole or *diastole respectively); continuous murmurs are heard throughout systole and diastole (also known as *machinery murmurs because of their characteristic sound).

Murphy’s sign a sign of inflammation of the gall bladder (see cholecystitis): continuous pressure over the gall bladder while the patient is taking a deep breath will cause pain at the point of maximum inhalation. [J. B. Murphy (1857–1916), US surgeon]

muscae volitantes see floaters.

muscle n. a tissue whose cells have the ability to contract, producing movement or force (see illustration). Muscles possess mechanisms for converting energy derived from chemical reactions into mechanical energy. The major functions of muscles are to produce movements of the body, to maintain the position of the body against the force of gravity, to produce movements of structures inside the body, and to alter pressures or tensions of structures in the body. There are three types of muscle: *striated muscle, attached to the skeleton; *smooth muscle, which is found in such tissues as the stomach, gut, and blood vessels; and *cardiac muscle, which forms the walls of the heart.

Muscle. A voluntary muscle in transverse section (left) and in longitudinal section at its junction with a tendon (right).





muscle relaxant an agent that reduces tension in voluntary muscles. Drugs such as *baclofen, *dantrolene, and *diazepam are used to relieve skeletal muscular spasms in various spastic conditions, parkinsonism, and tetanus. The drugs used to relax voluntary muscles during the administration of anaesthetics in surgical operations act by blocking the transmission of impulses at neuromuscular junctions. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, e.g. *atracurium besilate, cisatracurium, pancuronium, and rocuronium, bind to receptor sites normally occupied by acetylcholine; depolarizing muscle relaxants, e.g. *suxamethonium, mimic the action of acetylcholine but *depolarization is prolonged.

muscle spindle a specialized receptor, sensitive to stretch, that is embedded between and parallel to the fibres of striated muscles. These receptors are important for coordinated muscular movement. See also stretch receptor.

muscular dystrophy a group of muscle diseases, marked by weakness and wasting of selected muscles, in which there is a recognizable pattern of inheritance. The affected muscle fibres degenerate and are replaced by fatty tissue. The muscular dystrophies are classified according to the patient’s age at onset, distribution of the weakness, the progression of the disease, and the mode of inheritance. Isolated cases may occur as a result of gene mutation. Confirmation of the diagnosis is based upon *electromyography and muscle biopsy.

One common form is Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, which is inherited as a *sex-linked recessive character and is nearly always restricted to boys. It usually begins before the age of four, with selective weakness and wasting of the muscles of the pelvic girdle and back. The child has a waddling gait and *lordosis of the lumbar spine. The calf muscles – and later the shoulders and upper limbs – often become firm and bulky. Although the disease cannot be cured, physiotherapy and orthopaedic measures can relieve the disability. The identification of the gene abnormality raises the possibility of *gene therapy in the future. See also Becker muscular dystrophy; dystrophia myotonica.

muscularis n. a muscular layer of the wall of a hollow organ (such as the stomach) or a tubular structure (such as the intestine or the ureter). The muscularis mucosae is the muscular layer of a mucous membrane complex, especially that of the stomach or intestine.

muscular rheumatism any aching pain in the muscles and joints. Commonly the symptoms are due to *fibrositis; wear and tear of the joints (*osteoarthritis); or to inflammation of the muscles associated with abnormal immune reactions (*polymyalgia rheumatica). Generalized muscle pain with specific tender points and fatigue is called *fibromyalgia.

musculo- combining form denoting muscle.

musculocutaneous nerve a nerve of the *brachial plexus that supplies some muscles of the arm and the skin of the lateral part of the forearm.

mushroom n. the aerial fruiting (spore-producing) body of various fungi. Edible species include field mushrooms and cultivated mushrooms (Agaricus campestris and A. bisporus), the chanterelle (Cantherellus cibarius), and the parasol (Lepiota procera). However, great care must be taken in identifying edible fungi. Many species are poisonous, especially the death cap and panther cap (see Amanita).

musical tinnitus a form of tinnitus characterized by hearing snippets of music or indistinct speech, usually seen in association with significant *deafness.

MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool) a screening tool launched in 2003 to identify adult patients at risk of under- or overnutrition. It is quick to use and is validated for use in primary and secondary care.

mutagen n. an external agent that, when applied to cells or organisms, can increase the rate of *mutation. Mutagens usually only increase the number of mutants formed and do not cause mutations not found under natural conditions. Several kinds of radiation, many chemicals, and certain viruses can act as mutagens. Compare antimutagen.

mutant adj. affected by or showing the effects of a mutation. —mutant n.

mutation n. a change in the genetic material (*DNA) of a cell, or the change this causes in a characteristic of the individual, which is not caused by normal genetic processes. In a point (or gene) mutation there is a change in a single gene; in a chromosome mutation there is a change in the structure or number of the chromosomes. All mutations are rare events and may occur spontaneously or be caused by external agents (*mutagens). If a mutation occurs in developing sex cells (gametes) it may be inherited. Mutations in any other cells (somatic mutations) are not inherited.

mutism n. inability or refusal to speak. Innate speechlessness most commonly occurs in those who have been totally deaf since birth; this was formerly referred to as deaf-mutism but the term is now deprecated, as it implies wrongly that those affected are unable to make vocal sounds or to communicate effectively in other ways (sign language). Inability to speak may result from brain damage (see aphasia). It may also be caused by depression, psychosis, or psychological trauma, in which case the patient either does not speak at all or speaks only to particular persons or in particular situations. This latter condition is called selective mutism.

Treatment of mutism due to psychological causes is now increasingly by behavioural means, such as *prompting: people that the patient does not address are slowly introduced into the situation where the patient does speak. This may be done either alone or in combination with more traditional psychotherapy. Psychotic or depressive mutism or *catatonia are addressed by treating the underlying condition. —mute adj., n.

mutualism n. the intimate but not necessarily obligatory association between two different species of organism in which there is mutual aid and benefit. Compare symbiosis.

MWA see microwave ablation.

my- (myo-) combining form denoting muscle.

myalgia n. pain in the muscles. —myalgic adj.

myalgic encephalomyelitis (myalgic encephalopathy) see CFS/ME/PVF.

myasthenia gravis a chronic disease marked by abnormal fatigability and weakness of selected muscles, which is relieved by rest. The degree of fatigue is so extreme that these muscles are temporarily paralysed. The muscles initially affected are those around the eyes, mouth, and throat, resulting in drooping of the upper eyelids (*ptosis), double vision, *dysarthria, and *dysphagia. Myasthenia gravis is an *autoimmune disease in which acetylcholine-receptor autoantibodies bind to cholinergic receptors on muscle cells, which impairs the ability of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to induce muscular contraction. Treatment with *anticholinesterase drugs and surgical removal of the thymus in younger patients (under the age of 45 years) lessen the severity of the symptoms. Steroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, and plasma exchange may be used to treat the more severely affected patients.

myc- (myco-, mycet(o)-) combining form denoting a fungus.

mycelium n. (pl. mycelia) the tangled mass of fine branching threads that make up the feeding and growing part of a *fungus.

mycetoma n. a chronic inflammation of tissues caused by a fungus. See Madura foot.

Mycobacterium n. a genus of rodlike Gram-positive aerobic bacteria that can form filamentous branching structures. Some species are pathogenic to animals and humans: M. leprae (Hansen’s bacillus) causes *leprosy; M. tuberculosis (Koch’s bacillus) causes *tuberculosis. M. bovis causes tuberculosis in cattle but can also infect the human lungs, joints, and intestines. M. paratuberculosis, which causes Johne’s disease in cattle, can also be transmitted in milk and is suspected of being a cause of Crohn’s disease.

M. tuberculosis is by far the most common species responsible for infections of the lung. Other mycobacteria that infect the lung are variously described as atypical, anonymous, or *opportunistic – the favoured term since they usually require pre-existing lung damage or a defect in the patient’s immunity before they can give rise to infection. The opportunistic mycobacteria that most commonly cause lung infections are M. kansacii, M. xenopi, M. malmoense, and a group known as the MAI complex (M. avium, M. intracellulare). Infections caused by all these organisms can mimic pulmonary tuberculosis but are much more difficult to treat since they are resistant to many of the antituberculosis drugs. The MAI organisms are particularly likely to cause superimposed infection in cases of AIDS.

mycology n. the science of fungi. See also microbiology. —mycologist n.

mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation and also in the treatment of severe eczema. It is derived from the fungus Penicillium stoloniferum and acts by blocking purine synthesis in lymphocytes. Side-effects may limit its use.

mycoplasma n. one of a group of minute nonmotile bacteria that lack a rigid cell wall and hence display a variety of forms. The group includes some species that cause severe respiratory disease in cattle, sheep, and goats; one of these, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, causes *atypical pneumonia in humans.

mycosis n. any disease caused by a fungus, including actinomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, rhinosporidiosis, ringworm, and sporotrichosis.

mycosis fungoides the most common form of *cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with patches, plaques, and later nodules on the skin. It typically progresses very slowly and can be treated with topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, radiotherapy, or other agents.

Mycota n. see undecenoic acid.

mydriasis n. widening of the pupil, which occurs normally in dim light. The commonest cause of prolonged mydriasis is drug therapy (see mydriatic) or injury to the eye. See also cycloplegia. Compare miosis.

mydriatic n. a drug that causes the pupil of the eye to dilate. Examples are *atropine, *cyclopentolate, and *phenylephrine. Mydriatics in the form of eye drops or ointments are used to aid examination of the eye and to treat some eye inflammations such as iritis and cyclitis.

myectomy n. a surgical operation to remove part of a muscle.

myel- (myelo-) combining form denoting 1. the spinal cord. 2. bone marrow. 3. myelin.

myelencephalon n. see medulla oblongata.

myelin n. a complex material formed of protein and *phospholipid that is laid down as a sheath surrounding and insulating the *axons of certain neurons, known as myelinated (or medullated) nerve fibres. The material is produced and laid down in concentric layers by *Schwann cells at regular intervals along the nerve fibre (see illustrations). Myelinated nerves conduct impulses more rapidly than nonmyelinated nerves.

Myelin. Formation of a myelin sheath by a Schwann cell.





Myelin. Longitudinal section through a myelinated nerve fibre.





myelination n. the process in which *myelin is laid down as an insulating layer around the axons of certain nerves. Myelination of nerve tracts in the central nervous system is completed by the second year of life.

myelitis n. 1. an inflammatory disease of the spinal cord. The most usual kind (transverse myelitis) most often occurs during the development of multiple sclerosis, but it is sometimes a manifestation of *encephalomyelitis, when it can occur as an isolated attack. The inflammation spreads more or less completely across the tissue of the spinal cord, resulting in a loss of its normal function to transmit nerve impulses up and down. It is as though the spinal cord had been severed: paralysis and numbness affects the legs and trunk below the level of the diseased tissue. 2. inflammation of the bone marrow. See osteomyelitis.

myeloblast n. the earliest identifiable cell that gives rise to a *granulocyte, having a large nucleus and scanty cytoplasm. It is normally found in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, but may appear in the blood in a variety of diseases, most notably in acute myeloblastic *leukaemia. See also granulopoiesis. —myeloblastic adj.

myelocele n. see neural tube defects.

myelocyte n. an immature form of *granulocyte having an oval nucleus (compare metamyelocyte) and neutrophil, eosinophil, or basophil granules within its cytoplasm (compare promyelocyte). It is normally found in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, but may appear in the blood in a variety of diseases, including infections, infiltrations of the bone marrow, and certain leukaemias. See also granulopoiesis.

myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) a group of diseases in which the production of any one or all types of blood cells by the bone marrow is disrupted. Although myelodysplastic syndromes were previously referred to as preleukaemia, only a minority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes develop leukaemia.

myelofibrosis n. a chronic but progressive disease characterized by *fibrosis of the bone marrow, which leads to anaemia and the presence of immature red and white blood cells in the circulation. Other features include enlargement of the spleen and the presence of blood-forming (myeloid) tissue in abnormal sites, such as the spleen and liver (extramedullary *haemopoiesis). Its cause is unknown.

myelography n. a specialized method of X-ray examination to demonstrate the spinal canal that involves injection of a radiopaque contrast medium into the subarachnoid space by *lumbar puncture. The X-rays obtained are called myelograms. It is of importance in the recognition of tumours of the spinal cord and other conditions compressing the cord or the nerve roots. The former use of oil-based dyes in myelography was an occasional cause of *arachnoiditis. This complication is now avoided by the use of water-soluble contrast media. Myelography is now often combined with simultaneous CT scanning but is becoming increasingly superseded by *magnetic resonance imaging.

myeloid adj. 1. like, derived from, or relating to bone marrow. 2. resembling a *myelocyte. 3. relating to the spinal cord.

myeloid leukaemia a variety of *leukaemia in which the type of blood cell that proliferates abnormally originates in the blood-forming (myeloid) tissue of the bone marrow. Myeloid leukaemias may be acute or chronic and may involve any one of the cells produced by the marrow. Blood cells in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia contain a reciprocal *translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (see Philadelphia chromosome); molecular characterization of the translocation has led to the development of specific drugs to block the effects of this abnormality (see tyrosine kinase inhibitor).

myeloid tissue a tissue in the *bone marrow in which the various classes of blood cells are produced. See also haemopoiesis.

myeloma (multiple myeloma, myelomatosis) n. a malignant disease of the bone marrow, characterized by two or more of the following criteria: (1) the presence of an excess of abnormal malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow; (2) typical *lytic deposits in the bones on X-ray, giving the appearance of holes; (3) the presence in the serum of an abnormal gammaglobulin, usually IgG (an immunoglobulin; see paraprotein). *Bence-Jones protein may also be found in the serum or urine. The patient may complain of tiredness due to anaemia and of bone pain and may develop pathological fractures. Treatment is usually with such drugs as steroids, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, or thalidomide with local radiotherapy to particular areas of pain. See also plasmacytoma.

myeloma kidney see cast nephropathy.

myelomalacia n. softening of the tissues of the spinal cord, most often caused by an impaired blood supply.

myelomatosis n. see myeloma.

myelomeningocele n. see neural tube defects.

myiasis n. an infestation of a living organ or tissue by maggots. The flies normally breed in decaying animal and vegetable matter; myiasis therefore generally occurs only in regions of poor hygiene, and in most cases the infestations are accidental. Various genera may infect humans. *Gasterophilus, *Hypoderma, *Dermatobia, and Cordylobia (see tumbu fly) affect the skin; Fannia invades the alimentary canal and the urinary system; *Phormia and *Wohlfahrtia can infest open wounds and ulcers; *Oestrus attacks the eyes; and Cochliomyia invades the nasal passages. Treatment of external myiases involves the destruction and removal of maggots followed by the application of antibiotics to wounds and lesions.

myo- combining form. see my-.

myoblast n. a cell that develops into a muscle fibre. —myoblastic adj.

myocardial infarction death of a segment of heart muscle, which follows interruption of its blood supply (see coronary thrombosis). Myocardial infarction is usually confined to the left ventricle. The patient experiences a ‘heart attack’: sudden severe chest pain, which may spread to the arms and throat. Although severe chest pain is the most widely recognized symptom of myocardial infarction, many patients – especially women – do not have chest pain. Other presenting symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, shortness of breath, and dizziness. The main danger is that of ventricular *fibrillation, which accounts for most of the fatalities. Other *arrhythmias are also frequent. Other complications include heart failure, rupture of the heart, phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, shock, mitral regurgitation, and perforation of the septum between the ventricles.

Patients with myocardial infarction are best cared for in a specialized coronary care unit with facilities for the early detection, prevention, and treatment of arrhythmias and *cardiac arrest. Blockage of a major coronary artery is detected by elevation of the *S–T segment on the *electrocardiogram (STEMI or S–T elevation myocardial infarction). It is relieved by emergency *coronary angioplasty (commonly called primary *percutaneous coronary intervention) or the intravenous infusion of a drug to dissolve thrombus (*thrombolysis). Most survivors of myocardial infarction are able to return to a full and active life, including those who have been successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Lesser degrees of coronary obstruction may not be seen on the electrocardiogram but are revealed by the detection of raised *troponin levels in the blood (NSTEMI or non-S–T elevation myocardial infarction). Treatment is with *antiplatelet drugs and early percutaneous coronary intervention.

myocardial perfusion scan (thallium scan) a method to detect and quantify myocardial *ischaemia. An intravenously injected *radionuclide that is taken up by normal heart muscle can be imaged using a *gamma camera. Areas of scar due to *myocardial infarction emit little or no radioactivity and are seen as ‘cold spots’. Exercise is mimicked by infusing drugs to increase the heart rate in order to provoke cold spots in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease.

myocardial stunning the temporary loss of function of an area of heart muscle due to transient blockage of a coronary artery. It is typically seen following myocardial infarction that is treated promptly by successful emergency *percutaneous coronary intervention. The stunning may last up to two weeks.

myoglobinuria (myohaemoglobinuria) n. the presence in the urine of the pigment myoglobin.

myoglobinuric acute renal failure acute kidney injury caused by myoglobin that is released from damaged skeletal muscle (*rhabdomyolysis). This is usually the result of trauma and the condition was first recognized in victims trapped and crushed during the London Blitz. Muscle injury can also occur with pressure necrosis, particularly in the unconscious or immobile patient, or with a *compartment syndrome. Rarely it may complicate intensive muscular exercise or extensive viral myositis and it is a recognized complication of modest overexertion in some inherited disorders of muscle metabolism, such as *McArdle’s disease.

All are typified by weakness and wasting of the muscles, which may be associated with pain and tenderness.

myopia (short-sightedness) n. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus in front of the retina (see illustration). Closer objects are clearer as compared to distant objects. Myopia is corrected by wearing spectacles with concave lenses; contact lenses and surgery can also be used to correct myopia (see excimer laser; LASEK; LASIK). Compare emmetropia; hypermetropia. —myopic adj.

The symptoms are abolished with thyroxine treatment. —myxoedematous adj.

myxoedema coma a life-threatening condition due to severe *hypothyroidism, which is often precipitated by an acute event, such as surgery, prolonged exposure to cold, infection, trauma, other severe illness, or sedative drugs. It manifests as hypothermia, slowing of the heart rate with a reduction in blood pressure and sometimes heart failure, pleural and peritoneal effusions, urinary retention, and a gradually reduced conscious state resulting in coma. Blood tests show hypothyroidism, *hyponatraemia, hypercholesterolaemia, retention of carbon dioxide, and anaemia. Treatment is with intravenous *thyroxine at a high dosage until the patient wakes up, when tablets can be administered. Support on a ventilator and intravenous fluids may be needed. Active slow rewarming should be undertaken.

nabothian follicle (nabothian cyst, nabothian gland) one of a number of retention *cysts on the neck (cervix) of the uterus, near its opening to the vagina. The sacs, which contain mucus, form when the ducts of the glands in the cervix are blocked by a new growth of surface cells (epithelium) over an area damaged because of infection.

NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) a *coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor in oxidation-reduction reactions, particularly in the *electron transport chain in cellular respiration. NAD and the closely related coenzyme NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) are derived from nicotinic acid; they are reduced to NADH and NADPH, respectively.

nadolol n. a *beta blocker used mainly in the treatment of angina pectoris and *arrhythmias and to prevent migraine attacks. Side-effects include decreased heart rate, dizziness, and low blood pressure.

NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) see NAD.

Naegele rule a method used to calculate the estimated date of delivery: nine months and seven days are added to the date of the start of the last menstrual period. A correction is required if the woman does not have 28-day menstrual cycles. [F. K. Naegele (1777–1851), German obstetrician]

Naegele’s obliquity see asynclitism.

Naegleria n. a genus of *amoebae that normally live in damp soil or mud. Naegleria species can, however, live as parasites in humans: N. fowleri is responsible for primary amoebic *meningoencephalitis, a very rare, but fatal, infection of the brain.

naevus n. (pl. naevi) a birthmark: a clearly defined malformation of the skin, present at birth. There are many different types of naevi. Some, including the strawberry naevus and port-wine stain, are composed of small blood vessels (see haemangioma). The strawberry naevus (or strawberry mark) is a raised red lump usually appearing on the face and growing rapidly in the first month of life. These birthmarks slowly resolve and spontaneously disappear between the ages of five and ten. The port-wine stain (or capillary naevus) is a permanent purplish discoloration that may occur anywhere but usually appears on the upper half of the body. Laser treatment can reduce the discoloration. Occasionally a port-wine stain may be associated with a malformation of blood vessels over the brain, for example in the Sturge-Weber syndrome (see angioma).

It is not uncommon for a pale or white halo to develop around an ordinary pigmented naevus, especially on the trunk, forming a halo naevus. The pigmented naevus disappears over the course of a few months; this is followed by resolution of the pale area. A blue naevus is a small blue-grey papule appearing at birth or later in life, mainly on the extremities. Progression to malignant melanoma is very rare. A naevus of Ota is a blue-grey pigmented area on the cheek, eyelid, or forehead with similar pigmentation of the sclera of an eye. It is associated with melanomas of the uvea, orbit, and brain as well as with glaucoma of the affected eye. See also mole2.

NAFLD see nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Naga sore see tropical ulcer.

NAI see nonaccidental injury.

nail n. a horny structure, composed of keratin, formed from the epidermis on the dorsal surface of each finger and toe (see illustration). The exposed part of the nail is the body, behind which is the root. The whitish crescent-shaped area at the base of the body is called the lunula. Growth of the nail occurs at the end of the nail root by division of the germinative layer of the underlying *epidermis (which forms part of the matrix). The growing nail slides forward over the nail bed. The fold of skin that lies above the root is the nail fold; folds of skin on either side of the nail are the nail walls. The epidermis of the nail fold that lies next to the nail root is called the eponychium (forming the ‘cuticle’ at the base of the nail). Anatomical name: unguis.

Nail. Longitudinal section through the fingertip and nail.





nalidixic acid a *quinolone antibiotic active against various bacteria and used to treat infections of the urinary tract. Common side-effects are nausea, vomiting, and skin reactions.

Nanomedicine is the use of nanotechnology to deliver diagnostic or treatment modalities (e.g. drugs) directly to the relevant cells (e.g. cancer cells) in the human body.

napkin rash (nappy rash) a red skin rash within the napkin area, usually caused by chemical irritation (ammoniacal *dermatitis) or infection with *Candida. Ammoniacal dermatitis is caused by skin contact with wet soiled nappies, the stool bacteria reacting with urine to form irritant ammonia. Treatment involves exposure to air, application of barrier creams, and frequent nappy changes. Candidal nappy rash is treated with antifungal creams. Other causes of napkin rash include eczema and psoriasis.

naprapathy n. a system of medicine based on the belief that a great many diseases are attributable to displacement of ligaments, tendons, and other connective tissues and that cure can be brought about only by manipulation to correct these displacements.

naproxen n. an analgesic drug that also reduces inflammation and fever (see NSAID). It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, dysmenorrhoea, and gout. Side-effects may include digestive upsets and rashes: gastric bleeding can be prevented by administering naproxen in combination with *misoprostol.

naratriptan n. see 5HT1 agonist.

narcissism n. an excessive involvement with oneself and one’s self-importance, often to cover insecurity. In Freudian terms it is a state in which the *ego has taken itself as a love object. Some degree of narcissism is present in most individuals, but when it is shown to an extreme degree it may become a *personality disorder. —narcissistic adj.

narco- combining form denoting narcosis; stupor.

narcolepsy n. an extreme tendency to fall asleep in quiet surroundings or when engaged in monotonous activities. The patient can be woken easily and is immediately alert. It is often associated with *cataplexy, *sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic *hallucinations. One in 2000 individuals may be affected. Narcolepsy is strongly associated with reduced levels of *hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid. —narcoleptic adj., n.

narcosis n. a state of diminished consciousness or complete unconsciousness caused by the use of narcotic (i.e. opioid) drugs, which have a depressant action on the nervous system. The body’s normal reactions to stimuli are diminished and the body may become sedated or completely anaesthetized.

narcotic n. a drug that induces stupor and insensibility and relieves pain. Now largely obsolete in medical contexts, the term was used particularly for morphine and other derivatives of opium (see opiate) but also referred to other drugs that depress brain function (e.g. general anaesthetics and hypnotics). In legal terms a narcotic is any addictive drug subject to illegal use.

nares pl. n. (sing. naris) openings of the nose. The two external (or anterior) nares are the nostrils, leading from the nasal cavity to the outside. The two internal (or posterior) nares (choanae) are the openings leading from the nasal cavity into the pharynx.

narrative ethics an approach to ethical problems and practice that involves listening to and interpreting people’s stories rather than applying principles or rules to particular situations. This context-specific empathetic approach to patient and professional life stories is often contrasted with the universalizing rationalist approach of *Kantian ethics. Narrative ethics has an obvious relevance to the doctor–patient relationship and mirrors the clinical context in which moral choices are made.

NAS see neonatal abstinence syndrome.

nasal bone either of a pair of narrow oblong bones that together form the bridge and root of the nose. See skull.

nasal bridle a fixation device to prevent patients pulling out *nasogastric (NG) tubes. Two tiny catheter-mounted magnets are inserted either side of the nasal septum to meet in the nasopharyngeal space. This leaves tapes exiting from each nostril. A clip then secures the tapes and NG tube together.

National Health Service (NHS) (in Britain) a comprehensive service offering therapeutic and preventive medical and surgical care, including the prescription and dispensing of medicines, spectacles, and medical and dental appliances. Exchequer funds pay for the services of doctors, nurses, and other professionals, as well as residential costs in NHS hospitals, and meet a substantial part of the cost of the medicines and appliances. Legislation enacted in 1946 was implemented in 1948 and the services were subjected to substantial reorganization in 1974 and again in 1982, 1991, 1999, and in 2013 as a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. In England overall responsibility is vested in the Secretary of State for Health. Responsibility for commissioning most services is held by *clinical commissioning groups, consisting of GPs in a local area, and commissioning for primary care services and some specialized services is undertaken by *NHS England. Public health functions are largely delivered by local authorities, though some specialist functions are provided by *Public Health England. The relationship between the Secretary of State for Health and the NHS also changed in 2013. The Secretary of State for Health, via the *Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), no longer has direct control of the day-to-day operation of the NHS. This has passed to NHS England. However, the DHSC continues to provide strategic leadership for the NHS.

Different arrangements apply in Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.

National Insurance (in Britain) a compulsory scheme of insurance under the terms of which employers and employees make joint contributions so that those who have contributed for a qualifying period may claim national insurance benefits in times of sickness, injury, maternity leave, unemployment, and retirement; self-employed persons pay all their own contributions. Those who do not qualify under the terms of this insurance scheme may also receive financial payments in times of need, but only subject to a means test.

National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) formerly, a special health authority that led and coordinated work to improve all aspects of patient safety in England. The NPSA comprised three divisions: the National Reporting and Learning Service, the National Research Ethics Service, and the National Clinical Assessment Service. It closed in 2012, with its key functions transferred to *NHS England. In 2016 the same functions were transferred from NHS England to the newly formed *NHS Improvement.

national service frameworks (NSFs) formerly, national standards of care published for a variety of conditions and patient groups (the first were for coronary heart disease and mental health). NSFs were ten-year programmes designed to improve, and reduce variations in, the quality of care by defining long-term strategies for delivery of the standards and by setting specific goals. The NSFs were dropped in the reform of the NHS after 2010 and subsequent establishment of *NHS England.

National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) an occupational classification of the national population that was developed to replace older systems based on social classes and socio-economic groups. The groupings are intended to stratify the population according to different forms of employment: households are classified according to the occupation of the household reference person (the person renting, owning, or otherwise responsible for accommodation). The NS-SEC is used for official surveys and statistics, including the *census. The analytic version of the classification has eight classes and is the version used for most analyses.

natriuresis n. the excretion of sodium in the urine, especially in greater than normal amounts.

natriuretic n. an agent that promotes the excretion of sodium salts in the urine. Most *diuretics are natriuretics.

natriuretic peptide any of several peptides that stimulate diuresis (increased urine production) and vasodilatation (widening of blood vessels). They act on the kidney tubules to promote excretion of sodium (natriuresis) and water. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is produced in the atria of the heart in response to a rise in atrial pressure. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is produced in the brain and the ventricles of the heart, mainly in response to stretching of the ventricular muscle (as occurs in congestive heart failure). Measurement of blood levels of BNP can be used as a diagnostic test for heart failure and also as an indicator of prognosis.

natural killer cell (NK cell) a type of *lymphocyte that is able to kill virus-infected cells and cancerous cells and mediates rejection of bone-marrow grafts. NK cells are a part of natural (or innate) *immunity. Their function is regulated by a balance between activating receptors, which recognize proteins on cancerous or virus-infected cells, and inhibitory receptors specific for certain molecules encoded by the *HLA system.

naturopathy n. a system of medicine that relies upon the use of only ‘natural’ substances for the treatment of disease, rather than drugs. Herbs, food grown without artificial fertilizers and prepared without the use of preservatives or colouring material, pure water, sunlight, and fresh air are all employed in an effort to rid the body of ‘unnatural’ substances, which are said to be at the root of most illnesses.

nausea n. the feeling that one is about to vomit, as experienced in seasickness and in morning sickness of early pregnancy. Actual vomiting often occurs subsequently.

navel n. see umbilicus.

navicular bone a boat-shaped bone of the ankle (see tarsus) that articulates with the three cuneiform bones in front and with the talus behind.

Necator n. a genus of *hookworms that live in the small intestine. The human hookworm, N. americanus, occurs in tropical Africa, Central and South America, India, and the Pacific Islands. The worm possesses two pairs of sharp cutting plates inside its mouth cavity, which enable it to feed on the blood and tissues of the gut wall. Compare Ancylostoma.

necatoriasis n. an infestation of the small intestine by the parasitic hookworm Necator americanus. See also hookworm disease.

necessity n. the ethical and legal doctrine that provides justification for doing something that might otherwise be seen as blameworthy when the consequences of not doing so would be worse. For example, doctors have no right to touch a patient without consent, yet might be considered lacking in duty of care if they did not restrain patients who were about to kill themselves. See also paternalism.

neck n. 1. the part of the body that connects the head and the trunk. It is the region supported by the *cervical vertebrae. 2. see cervix.

necro- combining form denoting death or dissolution.

necrobiosis n. a gradual process by which cells lose their function and die. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a disease in which degeneration of collagen produces sharply demarcated yellowish-brown plaques, especially on the shins of women. The association with diabetes mellitus is controversial.

necrology n. the study of the phenomena of death, involving determination of the moment of death and the different changes that occur in the tissues of the body after death.

necropsy n. see autopsy.

necrosis (mortification) n. the death of some or all of the cells in an organ or tissue, caused by disease, physical or chemical injury, or interference with the blood supply (see gangrene). Caseous necrosis occurs in pulmonary tuberculosis, the lung tissue becoming soft, dry, and cheeselike. Coagulative necrosis – the commonest form of necrosis – occurs in almost all organs (except the brain) and results in a solid mass of dead tissue. Colliquative necrosis occurs in the brain, where the absence of stroma (connective tissue) results in total liquefaction of necrotic tissue. —necrotic adj.

necrospermia n. the presence of either dead or motionless spermatozoa in the semen. See infertility.

necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) a serious disease affecting the bowel during the first three weeks of life; it is much more common in preterm babies. The abdomen distends and blood and mucus appear in the stools; the bowel may perforate. Treatment is to rest the bowel and administer antibiotics. If the bowel becomes necrotic, surgery may be necessary. The cause is unknown but the disease may be the result of a reduced supply of oxygen to the bowel or infection.

necrotizing fasciitis a life-threatening bacterial infection of the layer of *fascia beneath the skin, usually by Streptococcus Type A. Symptoms appear rapidly after initial infection; they include a rash with blistering and discoloration of the skin, pain and inflammation of lymph nodes, fever, drowsiness, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Tissue necrosis and toxin production can result in shock and possible multi-organ failure. Necrotizing fasciitis is often associated with vascular disease, especially in diabetics, and the elderly and those who have recently undergone surgery are also vulnerable to the infection, which requires prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and excision of the involved tissue.

nedocromil n. a drug, related to sodium *cromoglicate, used to prevent asthma attacks and to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Possible side-effects include local irritation.

need n. what is required rather than simply desired or wanted. In allocating limited health-care resources, clinical need is often defined as the capacity to benefit from an intervention and assessed on a utilitarian basis (see quality of life). Other conceptions of need, such as the state of requiring rescue from a life-threatening situation, are based on *deontology.

needle n. a slender sharp-pointed instrument used for a variety of purposes. The size and shape of needles used in surgery for stitching tissue depend on the type of surgery. Most surgical needles have suture material fused onto them (so-called atraumatic needles). Hollow needles are used to inject substances into the body (in hypodermic syringes), to obtain specimens of tissue (see puncture), or to withdraw fluid from a cavity (see aspiration; biopsy). See also stop needle.

needle-stick injury a common accidental injury to the fingers and hands of nurses and doctors by contaminated injection needles. It can result in transmitted infections (e.g. hepatitis, AIDS).

needling n. the use of a sharp needle to make a hole in the lens capsule, usually to deal with the haze developing in the posterior capsule after cataract. This technique has now largely been replaced by use of the *YAG laser.

negative feedback loop a physiological loop for the control of hormone production by a gland. High levels of a circulating hormone act to reduce production of the releasing factors triggering its own production, i.e. they have a negative *feedback on these trigger factors. As circulating levels of the hormone fall, the negative feedback is reduced and the releasing factor starts to be produced again, allowing the hormone level to rise again.

negative symptoms (in psychiatry) symptoms of schizophrenia characterized by a deficiency in or absence of some aspect of functioning, such as social withdrawal, loss of initiative, and blunted affect. Compare positive symptoms.

negativism n. behaviour that is the opposite of that suggested by others. In active negativism the individual does the opposite of what is asked for (for example, screws the eyes up when asked to open them). In *psychosis it is usually associated with other features of *catatonia. In passive negativism the person fails to cooperate (for example, stops eating). This occurs in *schizophrenia and *depression.

neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) as defined by the *World Health Organization (WHO), a diverse group of *communicable diseases found almost entirely among poor populations in tropical and subtropical parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Although they affect more than 1.4 billion people, and countermeasures would in many cases be inexpensive, NTDs have traditionally received far less attention than the major infectious diseases HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In 2013 the WHO resolved to intensify its efforts to eradicate or control NTDs. The current WHO list identifies 24 such diseases, including *Buruli ulcer, *chikungunya fever, *dengue, *leishmaniasis, and *Madura foot (mycetoma).

neglect syndrome see hemispatial neglect.

negligence n. failure by a health-care professional to exercise a reasonable standard of care, as defined in the UK by the *Bolam and Bolitho tests, which ask whether the care provided fell short of that of a reasonable body of professional opinion and whether actions or omissions withstand logical analysis (the determination of which falls to the court). In order to establish negligence a claimant must show that a doctor had a *duty of care, that he or she breached this duty by falling below the expected standard of care, and that foreseeable harm was caused as a result of the professional’s conduct. The standard of proof in negligence actions is that of the civil law (i.e. on the balance of probabilities). Payment of *compensation to the claimant upon proving negligence is required by the UK civil law. Rarely, doctors may be charged with the criminal offence of manslaughter by gross negligence, which must be proved according to the standards of the criminal law (beyond reasonable doubt). If convicted, the sentence for gross negligence cases is likely to be custodial.

Neisseria n. a genus of spherical Gram-negative aerobic nonmotile bacteria characteristically grouped in pairs. They are parasites of animals, and some species are normal inhabitants of the human respiratory tract. The species N. gonorrhoeae (the gonococcus) causes *gonorrhoea. Gonococci are found within pus cells of urethral and vaginal discharge; they can be cultured only on serum or blood agar. N. meningitidis (the meningococcus) causes meningococcal *meningitis. Meningococci are found within pus cells of infected cerebrospinal fluid and blood or in the nasal passages of carriers. They too can only be cultured on serum or blood agar.

Nelson’s syndrome a condition in which an *ACTH-producing pituitary tumour expands after loss of negative *feedback following bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing’s disease. (see Cushing’s syndrome) Hyperpigmentation due to excess pituitary MSH secretion is a prominent feature. Nelson’s syndrome has become rare because the standard treatment for Cushing’s disease is now surgical removal of the tumour; bilateral adrenalectomy is used only in extreme circumstances. [D. H. Nelson (1925–2009), US physician]

nematode (roundworm) n. any one of a large group of worms having an unsegmented cylindrical body, tapering at both ends. This distinguishes nematodes from other *helminths. Nematodes occur either as free-living forms in the sea, fresh water, and soil or as parasites of plants, animals, and humans. *Hookworms and *threadworms infest the alimentary canal. *Filariae are found in the lymphatic tissues. The *guinea worm and *Onchocerca affect connective tissue. Some nematodes (e.g. threadworms) are transmitted from host to host by the ingestion of eggs; others (e.g. *Wuchereria) by the bite of a bloodsucking insect.

nemosis n. the activation of normal fibroblasts that occurs if they cluster and make cell-to-cell contact. This induces the production of *chemokines, *growth factors, enzymes, etc., which can influence cancer cells and inflammation. It leads to programmed cell death (see apoptosis).

neo- combining form denoting new or newly formed.

neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy that is given before the (usually) surgical treatment of a primary tumour with the aim of shrinking the tumour and therefore improving the results of surgery or radiotherapy and preventing the development of metastases. Compare adjuvant therapy.

neocerebellum n. the middle lobe of the *cerebellum, excluding the pyramid and uvula. In evolutionary terms it is the newest part, occurring only in mammals.

neointimal hyperplasia a pathological process involved in *atherosclerosis of arteries and vein grafts, and in *restenosis, that may be in response to angioplasty and stent placement. Damage to the endothelium of the artery exposes the underlying smooth muscle cells in the *media to cytokines, growth factors, and other plasma components in the circulation, which results in loss of their contractile characteristics. These abnormal muscle cells migrate to the *intima, where they proliferate and eventually form a thick layer of tissue (neointima), which occludes the artery.

neologism n. (in psychiatry) the invention of words that do not exist in one’s language. It is common in childhood, but when it occurs in an adult it may be a symptom of a psychotic illness, such as *schizophrenia. It should be distinguished from *paraphasia, in which new meanings are attached to ordinary words.

neomycin n. an *aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat infections caused by a wide range of bacteria, mainly those affecting the skin, ears, and eyes. It is sometimes given by mouth to sterilize the bowel before surgery.

neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) symptoms and signs exhibited by a newborn baby (neonate) due to drug withdrawal (see dependence). This results when the fetus has been exposed to addictive drugs through maternal substance abuse or misuse. Symptoms tend to occur in the first few days of life (in the case of methadone, which is a long-acting opioid, symptom onset may be delayed). They include tremors and jerking, high-pitched crying, sneezing, sucking of fists, feeding difficulties, shortened periods of sleep between feeds, rapid breathing, sweating, loose stools, nasal stuffiness, and frequent yawning. Treatment includes swaddling or snugly wrapping in a blanket, as babies with NAS are often difficult to comfort. Other nonpharmacological measures include frequent small feeds using high-calorie formula and intravenous fluids if babies become dehydrated. Drug therapy may be used for seizures and withdrawal symptoms.

neonatal early warning score an assessment tool for newborn babies, consisting of a chart in which a combination of *vital signs, neurological involvement, observation of blue skin and lips, and level of behavioural response indicate the appropriate level of concern. It is colour-coordinated from red to green to enable standardized escalation of concerns about the sick baby.

neonatal mortality rate see infant mortality rate.

neonatal screening *screening tests carried out on newborn babies to detect diseases that appear in the neonatal period, such as phenylketonuria (see Guthrie test). If these diseases are detected early enough, treatment may be instigated before any irreversible damage occurs to the baby.

neonatal teeth teeth that emerge through the gingiva (gums) during the first month of life.

neonatal urticaria see erythema.

neonate n. an infant at any time during the first 28 days of life. The word is particularly applied to infants just born or in the first week of life. —neonatal adj.

neopallium n. an enlargement of the wall of each cerebral hemisphere. In evolutionary terms it is the newest part of the cerebrum, formed by the development of new pathways for sight and hearing in mammals.

neoplasia n. a form of abnormal growth that is independent of the body’s normal homeostatic growth-regulating mechanisms, continues after the initiating stimulus has been removed, and is purposeless. Neoplasia is always pathological. See cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; MENS; prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; vulval intraepithelial neoplasia. Compare hyperplasia. —neoplastic adj.

neoplasm n. any new and abnormal growth: any *benign or *malignant tumour. —neoplastic adj.

neosphincter n. a substituted muscle or an implant for an absent or ineffective sphincter (see artificial sphincter).

neostigmine n. an *anticholinesterase drug used mainly to diagnose and treat *myasthenia gravis and to reverse the action of nondepolarizing *muscle-relaxant drugs used during surgery. Side-effects include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, increased salivation, and a slow heart rate (*bradycardia).

neovascularization n. the abnormal formation of new and fragile blood vessels, usually in response to ischaemia. In choroidal neovascularization, which occurs in such conditions as *macular degeneration, abnormal vessels, derived from the *choroid, form in the space between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid (see retina).

nephr- (nephro-) combining form denoting the kidney(s).

nephralgia n. pain in the kidney. The pain is felt in the loin and can be caused by a variety of kidney complaints.

nephrectomy n. surgical removal of a kidney. When performed for cancer of the kidney, the entire organ is removed together with its surrounding fat and the adjacent adrenal gland (radical nephrectomy). When performed for a benign condition the procedure is called a simple nephrectomy. Removal of either the upper or lower pole of the kidney is termed partial nephrectomy. The operation can be performed by *laparoscopy.

nephrin n. a transmembrane protein localized to the slit diaphragm of the *podocyte and necessary for the proper functioning of the renal filtration barrier. The latter consists of fenestrated endothelial cells, the basement membrane, and the epithelial podocyte. A defect in the gene coding for nephrin (NPHS1) on chromosome 19 results in congenital nephrotic syndrome of Finnish type (which is not exclusive to the Finnish population).

nephritic syndrome generalized inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidneys resulting in a reduction in *glomerular filtration rate, with mild oedema and hypertension resulting from renal salt and water retention. Urine analysis shows the presence of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria with red cell casts. Common and usually self-limiting causes are *Berger’s nephropathy and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Less common but more serious causes of the nephritic syndrome are the vasculitides (see vasculitis) and *Goodpasture’s disease, which, untreated, usually prove fatal.

nephritis (Bright’s disease) n. inflammation of the kidney. Nephritis is a nonspecific term used to describe a condition resulting from a variety of causes. See glomerulonephritis.

nephroblastoma (Wilms’ tumour) n. a malignant tumour arising from the embryonic kidney and occurring in young children, usually below the age of three and rarely over the age of eight. In approximately 5% of cases it involves both kidneys. Treatment consists of removing the kidney (see nephrectomy) and giving chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy. Although almost half the cases have spread by the time diagnosis is made, this does not prevent a cure: the number of children that survive at least five years after diagnosis is improving, being currently around 75%. In some children the tumour is associated with an abnormality of chromosome number 13; in these cases other features, such as absence of the iris in the eye (see aniridia) and *hemihypertrophy, are present. In other cases there is an association with congenital nephropathy and intersex disorders (see Denys-Drash syndrome).

nephrocalcinosis n. the presence of calcium deposits in the kidneys. This can be caused by excess calcium in the blood, as caused by overactivity of the parathyroid glands, or it may result from an underlying abnormality of the kidney. The cause of nephrocalcinosis must be detected by full biochemical, radiological, and urological investigation so that appropriate treatment can be undertaken.

nephrogenic cord either of the paired ridges of tissue that run along the dorsal surface of the abdominal cavity of the embryo. Parts of it develop into the kidney, ovary, or testis and their associated ducts. Intermediate stages of these developments are the *pronephros, *mesonephros, and *metanephros.

nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) a condition characterized by *polyuria and *polydipsia and due to failure of the renal tubules to respond, or to respond fully, to *vasopressin. One form of congenital NDI is caused by an X-linked (see sex-linked) dominant mutation of the gene encoding the vasopressin V2 receptor. A rarer form of congenital NDI is an autosomal recessive condition associated with genetic mutations in the gene encoding AQP-2 water channels (see aquaporin). Acquired NDI is much commoner than the congenital form and usually less severe. It is present in most patients with advancing chronic renal failure, is a feature of certain electrolyte disorders (hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia), and can complicate chronic lithium treatment.

nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy) a rare condition, first reported in 1997, that occurs exclusively in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who develop large areas of hardened skin with fibrotic nodules and plaques. Flexion contractures with an accompanying limitation of range of motion can also occur. Exposure to gadolinium, used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging, has been identified as a causative factor, but many patients with severe CKD have been exposed to gadolinium without consequence. Linear gadolinium preparations (Omniscan, OptiMARK) appear to carry the highest risk of NSF. There is no cure for the condition.

nephrolithiasis n. the presence of stones in the kidney (see calculus). Such stones can cause pain and blood in the urine, but they may produce no symptoms. Full investigation is undertaken to determine the underlying cause of stone formation. When stones are associated with urinary obstruction and infection they usually require surgical removal (see nephrolithotomy; pyelolithotomy).

nephrolithotomy n. the surgical removal of a stone from the kidney by an incision into the kidney substance. It is normally performed in combination with an incision into the renal pelvis (see pyelolithotomy). See also percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

nephrology n. the branch of medicine concerned with the study, investigation, and management of diseases of the kidney. See also urology. —nephrologist n.

nephron n. the active unit of excretion in the kidney (see illustration). Blood, which is supplied by branches of the renal artery, is filtered through a knot of capillaries (glomerulus) into the cup-shaped Bowman’s capsule so that water, nitrogenous waste, and many other substances (excluding colloids) pass into the renal tubule. Here most of the substances are reabsorbed back into the blood, the remaining fluid (*urine) passing into the collecting duct, which drains into the *ureter.

A single nephron.





nephropathy n. disease of the kidney. See also Balkan nephropathy; Berger’s nephropathy; cast nephropathy; Chinese herb nephropathy; diabetic nephropathy; HAN; HIVAN; hypercalcaemic nephropathy; hypokalaemic nephropathy; membranous nephropathy; minimal change nephropathy; sickle-cell nephropathy.

nephropexy n. an operation to fix a mobile kidney. The kidney is fixed to the twelfth rib and adjacent posterior abdominal wall to prevent descent of the kidney on standing (see nephroptosis). It is now usually performed laparoscopically.

nephroptosis n. abnormal descent of a kidney into the pelvis on standing, which may occur if it is excessively mobile (for example, in thin women). If this is accompanied by pain and obstruction to free drainage of urine by the kidney, *nephropexy may be advised.

nephrosclerosis n. hardening of the arteries and arterioles of the kidneys. Benign nephrosclerosis is associated with essential hypertension. There is preferential involvement of the preglomerular arterial vessels, primarily the afferent arteriole and the interlobular artery. The classic arterial lesion, which is termed arteriolosclerosis, involves replacement of smooth muscle cells in the media of the vessel by connective tissue. There is often evidence of ischaemia in the glomerulus and *tubulointerstitium. Functionally there may be some degree of renal impairment. End-stage renal failure is uncommon, but more likely to occur in Afro-Caribbeans. Malignant nephrosclerosis is the hallmark of *malignant hypertension, with arterioles showing mucoid change, endothelial cell swelling, and fibrinoid necrosis. The lumen of the vessel is reduced and red cells fragmented in their passage through the narrowing. The kidney shows petechial haemorrhage on the subcapsular surface, with mottling and areas of infarction. Malignant nephrosclerosis can lead to a very rapid destruction of renal function and is recognized as a potential cause of acute renal failure.

nephroscope n. an instrument (*endoscope) used for examining the interior of the kidney, usually passed into the renal pelvis through a track from the skin surface after needle *nephrostomy and dilatation of the tract over a guidewire. The nephroscope allows the passage of instruments under direct vision to remove calculi (see percutaneous nephrolithotomy), or to disintegrate them using ultrasound probes or pneumatic energy via a lithoclast, or a combination of the two.

nephroscopy n. inspection of the interior of the kidney with a *nephroscope.

nephrosis n. (in pathology) degenerative changes in the epithelium of the kidney tubules. The term is sometimes used loosely for the *nephrotic syndrome.

nephrostogram n. X-ray imaging (see fluoroscopy) of the interior of the kidney and ureter after injecting a radiographic *contrast medium through a catheter placed inside the renal pelvis (see nephrostomy). This procedure is done to check for any problems with the drainage of urine from the pelvis to the ureter.

nephrostomy n. drainage of urine from the kidney by a tube (catheter) passing through the kidney into the renal pelvis via the skin surface. The procedure is performed by a urologist or an interventional radiologist, often under ultrasound guidance. This is commonly used as a temporary procedure to alleviate renal obstruction. Long-term urine drainage by nephrostomy may be complicated by the attendant problems of infection and obstruction of the catheter by debris. Nephrostomy is also performed to enable the passage of a *nephroscope.

nephrotic syndrome (NS) a condition defined by the triad of peripheral oedema, heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), and hypoalbuminaemia (serum albumin usually >25 g/l). In most cases there is hypercholesterolaemia and lipiduria. There are many causes of the nephrotic syndrome. In children, the main cause is *minimal change nephropathy, which is usually steroid-responsive. In adults, minimal change disease is still an important cause of NS, but is responsible for only a minority of cases. Many of the other causes of NS in adults are unlikely to respond to steroids and it is therefore usual practice to perform a biopsy before considering specific treatment. The commonest causes of NS in adults are *diabetic nephropathy, *focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and *membranous nephropathy. Pre-eclampsia is an important cause in late pregnancy.

nephrotomy n. surgical incision into the substance of the kidney. This is usually undertaken to remove a kidney stone (see nephrolithotomy).

nephrotoxic adj. liable to cause damage to the kidneys. Nephrotoxic drugs include *aminoglycoside antibiotics, sulphonamides, and gold compounds. —nephrotoxicity n.

nephroureterectomy (ureteronephrectomy) n. the surgical removal of a kidney together with its ureter. This operation is performed for cancer of the kidney pelvis or ureter. It is also undertaken when the kidney has been destroyed by *vesicoureteric reflux, to prevent subsequent continuing reflux into the stump of the ureter that would occur if only the kidney were removed.

nerve n. a bundle of conducting *nerve fibres (see illustration) that transmit impulses from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles and glands (motor nerves) or inwards from the sense organs to the brain and spinal cord (sensory nerves). Most large nerves are mixed nerves, containing both motor and sensory nerve fibres running to and from a particular region of the body.

Nerve. Transverse section through a peripheral nerve with five fascicles.





nerve block a method of producing *anaesthesia in part of the body by blocking the passage of pain impulses in the sensory nerves supplying it. A local anaesthetic, such as lidocaine, is injected into the tissues in the region of a nerve. In this way anaesthesia can be localized, so that minor operations can be performed without the necessity of giving a general anaesthetic. A *ring block is a common technique used for anaesthetizing a digit.

nerve cell see neuron.

nerve conduction study a test done to assess the peripheral nervous system. It involves activating the nerves electronically with electrical pulses and measuring the responses obtained.

nerve ending the final part (terminal) of one of the branches of a nerve fibre, where a *neuron makes contact either with another neuron at a synapse or with a muscle or gland cell at a neuromuscular or neuroglandular junction.

nerve entrapment syndrome any syndrome resulting from pressure on a nerve from surrounding structures. Examples include the *carpal tunnel syndrome and *meralgia paraesthetica.

nerve fibre the long fine process that extends from the cell body of a *neuron and carries nerve impulses. Bundles of nerve fibres running together form a *nerve. Each fibre has a sheath, which in medullated nerve fibres is a relatively thick layer containing the fatty insulating material *myelin.

nerve gas any gas that disrupts the normal functioning of nerves and thus of the muscles they supply. There are two groups, the G agents and the V agents. The latter are more than 300 times as deadly as mustard gas: one inhalation can kill by paralysing the respiratory muscles. V agents also act through the skin, therefore gas masks are ineffective protection against them.

nerve growth factor (NGF) a protein (see growth factor), consisting of two polypeptide chains, that is required for the development and longevity of some neurons, including those in the sympathetic nervous system and some central nervous system and sensory neurons. Nerve growth factor is necessary for axon growth and also for initiating new neuronal connections with other cells. The role of NGFs in preventing the degeneration of brain cells is being explored in research into Alzheimer’s disease.

nerve impulse the electrical activity in the membrane of a *neuron that – by its rapid spread from one region to the next – is the means by which information is transmitted within the nervous system along the axons of the neurons. The membrane of a resting nerve is charged (polarized) because of the different concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. When a nerve impulse is triggered, a wave of *depolarization spreads, and ions flow across the membrane (see action potential). Until the nerve has undergone *repolarization no further nerve impulses can pass.

nerve regeneration the growth of new nerve tissue, which occurs at a very slow rate (1–2 mm per day) after a nerve has been severed and is often partially or totally incomplete. *Microsurgery has improved the results by facilitating primary repair in the immediate aftermath of injury. See also axonotmesis; neurotmesis.

nervous breakdown a nonmedical term applied to a range of emotional crises varying from a brief attack of ‘hysterical’ behaviour to a major *mental illness. The term is also sometimes used as a euphemism for a frank psychiatric illness, such as *schizophrenia.

nervous system the vast network of cells specialized to carry information (in the form of *nerve impulses) to and from all parts of the body in order to bring about bodily activity. The brain and spinal cord together form the *central nervous system; the remaining nervous tissue is known as the *peripheral nervous system and includes the *autonomic nervous system, which is itself divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The basic functional unit of the nervous system is the *neuron (nerve cell).

Nesbit’s operation an operation devised to surgically straighten a congenitally curved penis but now more frequently employed to correct the penile curvature caused by *Peyronie’s disease. The procedure can often result in penile shortening. [R. M. Nesbit (20th century), US surgeon]

nesidioblastosis n. a rare condition of childhood in which abnormal cells in the pancreas fail to mature properly and secrete a selection of hormones (including insulin) in an uncontrolled manner. This causes a variety of problems, including recurrent *hypoglycaemia. It can sometimes be treated with medication; if this fails, surgical removal of a portion of the pancreas may be necessary.

NETs neuroendocrine tumours. See neuroendocrine system.

nettle rash see urticaria.

neur- (neuro-) combining form denoting nerves or the nervous system.

neural arch see vertebra.

neural crest the two bands of ectodermal tissue that flank the *neural plate of the early embryo. Cells of the neural crest migrate throughout the embryo and develop into sensory nerve cells and peripheral nerve cells of the autonomic nervous system.

neuralgia n. a severe burning or stabbing pain often following the course of a nerve. Postherpetic neuralgia is an intense debilitating pain felt at the site of a previous attack of shingles. In trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) there are brief paroxysms of searing pain felt in the distribution of one or more branches of the *trigeminal nerve in the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is managed principally by prescription of *carbamazepine. Migrainous neuralgia is characterized by severe unilateral pain around one eye (see cluster headache).

neural plate the strip of ectoderm lying along the central axis of the early embryo that forms the *neural tube and subsequently the central nervous system.

neural spine the spinous process situated on the neural arch of a *vertebra.

neural tube the embryological structure from which the brain and spinal cord develop. It is a hollow tube of ectodermal tissue formed when two edges of a groove in a plate of primitive neural tissue (neural plate) come together and fuse. Failure of normal fusion results in a number of congenital defects (see neural tube defects).

neural tube defects a group of congenital abnormalities caused by failure of the *neural tube to form normally. In *spina bifida the bony arches of the spine, which protect the spinal cord and its coverings (the meninges), fail to close. More severe defects of fusion of these bones will result in increasingly serious neurological conditions. A meningocele is the protrusion of the meninges through the gap in the spine, the skin covering being vestigial. There is a constant risk of damage to the meninges, with resulting infection. Urgent surgical treatment to protect the meninges is therefore required. In a meningomyelocele (myelomeningocele, myelocele) the spinal cord and the nerve roots are exposed, often adhering to the fine membrane that overlies them. There is a constant risk of infection and this condition is accompanied by paralysis and numbness of the legs and urinary incontinence. *Hydrocephalus and an *Arnold–Chiari malformation are usually present. A failure of fusion at the cranial end of the neural tube (cranium bifidum) gives rise to comparable disorders. The bone defect is most often in the occipital region of the skull but it may occur in the frontal or basal regions. A protrusion of the meninges alone is known as a cranial meningocele. The terms meningoencephalocele, encephalocele, and cephalocele are used for the protrusion of brain tissue through the skull defect. This is accompanied by severe mental and physical disorders.

neuraminidase (NA, N) a glycoprotein projecting from the surface layer of the lipid bilayer envelope of *influenza virions. It attacks sialic acid residues on host cells and may be involved in virus release. It is a key target for antibody attack and therefore is important in vaccination.

neurapraxia n. temporary loss of nerve function resulting in tingling, numbness, and weakness. It is usually caused by compression of the nerve and there is no structural damage involved. Complete recovery occurs. Compare axonotmesis; neurotmesis.

neurasthenia n. a set of psychological and physical symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, headache, dizziness, and intolerance of noise. It can be caused by organic damage, such as a head injury, or it can be due to anxiety. —neurasthenic adj., n.

neurectasis n. the surgical procedure for stretching a peripheral nerve.

neurectomy n. the surgical removal of the whole or part of a nerve.

neurilemma (neurolemma) n. the sheath of the *axon of a nerve fibre. The neurilemma of a medullated fibre contains *myelin laid down by Schwann cells. —neurilemmal adj.

neurilemmoma (neurinoma) n. a benign slow-growing tumour that arises from the neurilemma of a nerve fibre.

neurinoma n. see neurilemmoma.

neuritis n. a disease of the peripheral nerves showing the pathological changes of inflammation. The term is also used in a less precise sense as an alternative to *neuropathy. See also retrobulbar neuritis.

neuroanatomy n. the study of the structure of the nervous system, from the gross anatomy of the brain down to the microscopic details of neurons.

neurobiotaxis n. the predisposition of a nerve cell to move towards the source of its stimuli during development.

neuroblast n. any of the nerve cells of the embryo that give rise to functional nerve cells (neurons).

neuroblastoma n. a malignant tumour, usually of childhood, composed of embryonic nerve cells. It may originate in any part of the sympathetic nervous system, most commonly in the medulla of the adrenal gland, and secondary growths are often widespread in other organs and in bones. It can nevertheless be very responsive to systemic chemotherapy.

neurocardiogenic syncope (malignant vasovagal syndrome) recurrent loss of consciousness due to a drop in blood pressure mediated by *vasodilatation, *bradycardia, or a combination of the two. Attacks resemble a simple faint, but can be very disabling because they are much more frequent and severe. Treatment comprises increased fluid and salt intake together with training in postural manoeuvres that may prevent attacks. A variety of drug treatments is available, but these are commonly ineffective. Implantation of a permanent *pacemaker may be required if profound bradycardia is a feature.

neurocranium n. the part of the skull that encloses the brain.

neurodermatitis n. see lichen simplex chronicus.

neuroendocrine system the system of dual control of certain activities of the body by means of both nerves and circulating hormones. The functioning of the autonomic nervous system is particularly closely linked to that of the pituitary and adrenal glands. The system can give rise to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), which have special structural features and often produce active hormones. See also neurohormone; neurosecretion.

neuroepithelioma n. a malignant tumour of the retina of the eye. It is a form of *glioma and may spread into the brain if not treated early.

neuroepithelium n. a type of epithelium associated with organs of special sense. It contains sensory nerve endings and is found in the retina, the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear, the mucous membrane lining the nasal cavity, and the taste buds. —neuroepithelial adj.

neurofibril n. one of the microscopic threads of cytoplasm found in the cell body of a *neuron and also in the *axoplasm of peripheral nerves.

neurofibrillary tangles twisted filaments composed of an abnormal form of tau protein, which normally occurs in microtubules (structural elements) of cells. They are found in the brains of patients with *Alzheimer’s disease.

neurofibroma n. a benign tumour growing from the fibrous coverings of a peripheral nerve: it arises from *Schwann cells, lacks a capsule (therefore it may incorporate nerve fibres), and is usually symptomless. When it develops from the sheath of a nerve root, it causes pain and may compress the spinal cord. A schwannoma is similar but encapsulated (sometimes the terms are used synonymously).

neurofibromatosis n. either of two hereditary conditions inherited as autosomal *dominant traits and characterized by benign tumours growing from the fibrous coverings of nerves (see neurofibroma). In neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen’s disease), in which the abnormal gene is found on chromosome 17, numerous tumours affect the peripheral nerves. The tumours can be felt beneath the skin along the course of the nerves; they may become large, causing disfigurement, and rarely they become malignant, giving rise to neurofibrosarcomas. Pigmented patches on the skin (see café au lait spots) are commonly found and *Lisch nodules are present. Neurofibromatosis type II presents with bilateral *vestibular schwannomas (causing hearing loss) and *meningiomas. The abnormal gene is on chromosome 22.

neurogenesis n. the growth and development of nerve cells.

neurogenic adj. 1. caused by disease or dysfunction of the nervous system. 2. arising in nervous tissue. 3. caused by nerve stimulation.

neuroglia n. see glia.

neurohormone n. a hormone that is produced within specialized nerve cells and is secreted from the nerve endings into the circulation. Examples are the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, produced within the nerve cells of the hypothalamus and released into the circulation in the posterior pituitary gland, and noradrenaline, released from *chromaffin tissue in the adrenal medulla.

neurohumour n. a *neurohormone or a *neurotransmitter.

neurohypophysis n. the posterior lobe of the *pituitary gland.

neurolemma n. see neurilemma.

neuroleptic malignant syndrome a life-threatening syndrome seen after starting *antipsychotic medication. It is characterized by confusion, muscle rigidity, fever, pallor and sweating, urinary incontinence, and a high level of *creatine kinase. Its symptoms can appear similar to *catatonia. Treatment in a high-dependency unit with high-dose benzodiazepines and immediate cessation of antipsychotic drugs is usually indicated.

neurology n. the study of the structure, functioning, and diseases of the nervous system (including the brain, spinal cord, the peripheral nerves, and muscles). —neurological adj. —neurologist n.

neuroma n. any tumour derived from cells of the nervous system. Such tumours are now usually categorized more specifically (e.g. *neurofibroma, *neurilemmoma). See also vestibular schwannoma.

neuromuscular junction (myoneural junction) the meeting point of a nerve fibre and the muscle fibre that it supplies. Between the enlarged end of the nerve fibre (motor end-plate) and the membrane of the muscle is a gap across which a *neurotransmitter must diffuse from the nerve to trigger contraction of the muscle.

neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s disease) a condition that resembles multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by the finding of the antiaquaparin-4 antibody (NMO IgG antibody). Typically there is a transverse *myelitis, producing paralysis and numbness of the legs and trunk below the inflamed spinal cord, and *retrobulbar (optic) neuritis affecting both optic nerves. The attacks of myelitis and optic neuritis may coincide or they may be separated by days or weeks. Recovery from the initial attack is often incomplete and severe relapses occur commonly unless treatment with immunosuppressive therapies is started.

neuron (neurone, nerve cell) n. one of the basic functional units of the nervous system: a cell specialized to transmit electrical *nerve impulses and so carry information from one part of the body to another (see illustration). Each neuron has an enlarged portion, the cell body (perikaryon), containing the nucleus; from the body extend several processes (dendrites) through which impulses enter from their branches. A longer process, the nerve fibre (see axon), extends outwards and carries impulses away from the cell body. This is normally unbranched except at the *nerve ending. The point of contact of one neuron with another is known as a *synapse.

Neuron. A motor neuron (left) and a sensory neuron (right).





neuronophagia n. the process whereby damaged or degenerating nerve cells finally disintegrate and are removed by scavenger cells (*phagocytes).

neuronoplasty n. reconstructive surgery for damaged or severed peripheral nerves.

neuropathic arthritis (Charcot’s joint) a condition leading to progressive destruction and deformity of weight-bearing joints, resulting from damage to the sensory nerves that supply them. Causes include diabetes mellitus (see diabetic neuropathy), *tabes dorsalis, *syringomyelia, leprosy, congenital insensitivity to pain, and other neurological problems. Patients develop an unstable painless swollen joint; treatment is focused on limitation of activity and bracing.

neuropathic bladder a malfunctioning bladder due to partial or complete interruption of its nerve supply. Causes include injury to the spinal cord, spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy.

neuropathy n. any disease of the peripheral nerves, usually causing weakness and numbness. In a mononeuropathy a single nerve is affected and the extent of the symptoms depends upon the distribution of that nerve. In a polyneuropathy (see peripheral neuropathy) many or all of the nerves are involved and the symptoms are most profound at the extremities of the limbs. See also diabetic neuropathy. —neuropathic adj.

neuropeptide Y a peptide, related to *pancreatic polypeptide, that is found in the central and peripheral nervous systems (it is particularly abundant in the hypothalamus). It has a variety of actions, including stimulation of appetite, gastrointestinal regulation, reproduction, memory, circadian rhythms, and cardiovascular functioning.

neurophysiology n. the study of the complex chemical and physical changes that are associated with the activity of the nervous system.

neuropil n. nerve tissue that is visible microscopically as a mass of interwoven and interconnected nerve endings, dendrites, and other neuron components, rather than an ordered array of axons.

neuroplasticity (neural plasticity) n. the ability of the brain to develop new neurons and/or new synapses in response to stimulation and learning. Recent research shows that the brain retains its plasticity throughout life, more or less, depending on the person’s state of health, etc. Following injury to the brain, neuroplasticity may allow uninjured areas to take over the processes previously carried out by the injured areas.

neuropsychiatry n. the branch of medicine concerned with the psychiatric effects of disorders of neurological function or structure. Increasingly, the correlation is being drawn between demonstrable brain changes and the resulting effects on the mind. It is the function of the growing specialty of neuropsychiatry to investigate this relationship.

neuroretinitis n. combined inflammation of the optic nerve and the retina.

neurosecretion n. any substance produced within, and secreted by, a nerve cell. Important examples are the hormone-releasing factors produced by the cells of the *hypothalamus and released into blood vessels of the pituitary gland, on which they act.

neurosis n. (pl. neuroses) any long-term mental or behavioural disorder in which contact with reality is retained and the condition is recognized by the sufferer as abnormal: the term and concept originated from Freud. A neurosis essentially features anxiety or behaviour exaggeratedly designed to avoid anxiety. Defence mechanisms against anxiety take various forms and may appear as phobias, obsessions, compulsions, or sexual dysfunctions. In recent classifications, the disorders formerly included under the neuroses have been renamed. The general term is now anxiety disorder; hysteria has become *conversion disorder; amnesia, fugue, and depersonalization are *dissociative disorders; obsessional neurosis is now known as *obsessive–compulsive disorder; and depressive neurosis has become *dysthymia. Psychoanalysis has proved of little value in curing these conditions; *behaviour therapy and *SSRIs are effective in many cases. —neurotic adj.

neurosurgery n. the surgical or operative treatment of diseases of the brain and spinal cord. This includes the management of head injuries, the relief of raised intracranial pressure and compression of the spinal cord, the eradication of infection (e.g. cerebral *abscess), the control of intracranial haemorrhage, and the diagnosis and treatment of tumours. The development of neurosurgery has been supported by advances in anaesthetics, radiology, and scanning techniques.

neurosyphilis n. *syphilis affecting the nervous system.

neuroticism n. a dimension of personality derived from questionnaires and psychological tests. People with high scores in neuroticism are anxious and intense, emotionally unstable, and more prone to develop *neurosis.

neurotomy n. the surgical procedure of severing a nerve.

neurotoxic adj. poisonous or harmful to nerve tissue and dental pulp cells. —neurotoxicity n.

neurotransmitter n. a chemical substance released from nerve endings to transmit impulses across *synapses to other nerves and across the minute gaps between the nerves and the muscles or glands that they supply. Outside the central nervous system the chief neurotransmitter is *acetylcholine; *noradrenaline is released by nerve endings of the sympathetic system. In the central nervous system, as well as acetylcholine and noradrenaline, *dopamine, *serotonin, *gamma-aminobutyric acid, the amino acid glutamate, and several other substances act as transmitters.

neurotrophic adj. relating to the growth and nutrition of neural tissue in the body.

neurotropic adj. growing towards or having an affinity for neural tissue. The term may be applied to viruses, chemicals, or toxins.

neutropenia n. an abnormal decrease in the number of *neutrophils in peripheral blood. Neutropenia may occur in a wide variety of diseases, including certain hereditary defects, aplastic *anaemias, tumours of the bone marrow, *agranulocytosis, and acute leukaemias. In cancer patients it is often due to the deleterious effects of *cytotoxic drugs on bone marrow cells. Neutropenia results in an increased susceptibility to infections; if patients become unwell, due to infection, this can lead to neutropenic sepsis, which can be life-threatening. —neutropenic adj.

neutrophil n. a variety of *granulocyte (a type of white blood cell) distinguished by a lobed nucleus and the presence in its cytoplasm of fine granules that stain purple with *Romanowsky stains. It is capable of ingesting and killing bacteria and provides an important defence against infection. There are normally 2.0–7.5 × 109 neutrophils per litre of blood. See also polymorph.

newton n. the *SI unit of force, equal to the force required to impart to 1 kilogram an acceleration of 1 metre per second per second. Symbol: N.

nexus n. (in anatomy) a connection or link.

NHS Trust Development Authority formerly, a *special health authority of the NHS established under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to oversee NHS trusts without *foundation trust status and to support their transition to such status. The Authority closed in 2016, when its functions were transferred to the newly established *NHS Improvement.

NHS walk-in centre a medical centre offering free and fast access to health-care advice and treatment. The first centres were opened in 2000. They provide advice and treatment for minor injuries and illnesses as well as guidance on how to use NHS services. Currently, the NHS offers a mix of walk-in centres, urgent care centres, minor injury units, and urgent treatment centres, all with different levels of service. By the end of 2019, these will all be called urgent treatment centres.

niacin n. see nicotinic acid.

nicardipine n. a *calcium-channel blocker used to prevent angina and treat hypertension. Possible side-effects include nausea, dizziness, headache, flushing, and palpitations.

NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) a non-departmental public body that provides national guidance and advice to improve health and social care. NICE was originally set up in 1999 as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, a special health authority, to reduce variation in the availability and quality of NHS treatments and care. In 2005, after merging with the Health Development Agency, it began developing public health guidance to help prevent ill health and promote healthier lifestyles and the name changed to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. In April 2013 NICE was established in primary legislation, placing it on a statutory footing as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. At this time it took on responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards in social care, and the name changed once more to reflect these new responsibilities.

nicotinamide n. a B vitamin: the amide of *nicotinic acid.

nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide see NAD.

nicotine n. a poisonous alkaloid derived from *tobacco, responsible for the dependence of regular smokers on cigarettes. In small doses nicotine has a stimulating effect on the autonomic nervous system, causing in regular smokers such effects as raised blood pressure and pulse rate and impaired appetite. Large doses cause paralysis of the autonomic ganglia. Nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine products formulated as chewing gum, skin patches, nasal sprays, etc.) is used as an aid to stop smoking.

nicotinic acid (niacin) a B vitamin. Nicotinic acid is a derivative of pyridine and is interchangeable with its amide, nicotinamide. Both forms of the vitamin are equally active. Nicotinamide is a component of the coenzymes *NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP, its phosphate. Nicotinic acid is required in the diet, but can also be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan. A deficiency of the vitamin leads to *pellagra. Good sources of nicotinic acid are meat, yeast extracts, and pulses. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) depends on the kcal content of the diet and is 6.6 mg niacin equivalent/1000 kcal, which equates to about 17 mg/day for males and 13 mg/day for females. 1 mg niacin equivalent is equal to 1 mg of available nicotinic acid or 60 mg tryptophan.

nictitation n. exaggerated and frequent blinking or winking of the eyes.

nidation n. see implantation.

nidus n. 1. a place in which bacteria have settled and multiplied because of particularly suitable conditions: a focus of infection. 2. the nucleus of a crystal.

nifedipine n. a *calcium-channel blocker used in the prevention of angina and treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Side-effects include dizziness, headache, and nausea.

night blindness (nyctalopia) the inability to see in dim light or at night. It is due to a disorder of the cells in the retina that are responsible for vision in dim light (see rod), and can result from dietary deficiency of *vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency may progress to cause *xerophthalmia and *keratomalacia. Night blindness may be caused by other retinal diseases, e.g. *retinitis pigmentosa. Congenital stationary night blindness is characterized by poor night vision from early childhood that does not get worse, in association with *nystagmus. Compare day blindness.

night sweat copious sweating during sleep. Night sweats may be an early indication of tuberculosis, AIDS, or other disease.

night terror the condition in which a child (usually aged 2–7 years), soon after falling asleep, starts screaming and appears terrified. The child cannot be comforted because he or she remains mentally inaccessible; the attack ceases on fully wakening and is never remembered. Attacks sometimes follow a stressful experience.

Nile blue an oxazine chloride, used for staining lipids and lipid pigments. Nile blue A (Nile blue sulphate), which stains fatty acids, changes from blue to purplish at pH 10–11.

NIPPV noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (see noninvasive ventilation).

Nippy trade name for a brand of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilator that delivers air through a close-fitting nasal mask (see noninvasive ventilation). The Nippy was one of the early ventilators from the late 1980s and early 1990s, initially used in intensive care units. Although many others are now in use, the name is often used as a generic term for devices used on general wards for ventilatory support for patients with acute exacerbations of *chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Nissl granules collections of dark-staining material, containing RNA, seen in the cell bodies of neurons on microscopic examination. [F. Nissl (1860–1919), German neuropathologist]

nitric acid a strong corrosive mineral acid, HNO3, the concentrated form of which is capable of producing severe burns of the skin. Swallowing the acid leads to intense burning pain and ulceration of the mouth and throat. Treatment is by immediate administration of alkaline solutions, followed by milk or olive oil.

nitric oxide an important member of the group of gaseous mediators, which – together with amine mediators (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine) and lipid mediators (e.g. prostaglandins) – produce many physiological responses (e.g. smooth muscle relaxation). Nitric oxide is involved in the manifestations of sepsis and septic shock. Formula: NO.

nitrofurantoin n. a drug used to treat bacterial infections of the urinary system. It may cause nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and skin rashes.

nitrogen n. a gaseous element and a major constituent of air (79 per cent). Nitrogen is an essential constituent of proteins and nucleic acids and is obtained by animals in the form of protein-containing foods (atmospheric nitrogen cannot be utilized directly). Nitrogenous waste is excreted as *urea. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze some specimens before pathological examination. Symbol: N.

nitrogen balance the relationship between the nitrogen taken into the body and that excreted, denoting the balance between the manufacture and breakdown of the body mass. A negative nitrogen balance, when excretion exceeds intake, is usual after injury or operations as the energy requirements of the body are met disproportionately from endogenous sources.

nitroglycerin n. see glyceryl trinitrate.

nitroprusside (sodium nitroprusside) n. a cyanide-containing drug used mainly in the emergency treatment of high blood pressure. It is the most effective known means of reducing dangerously high pressure, but its effects and level in the blood must be closely monitored. Possible side-effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations, sweating, and chest pain.

nitrous oxide a colourless gas used as an *anaesthetic with good analgesic properties. It is administered by inhalation, in conjunction with oxygen and other agents, for the maintenance of anaesthesia. A mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide provides effective analgesia for some dental procedures and in childbirth; such a state is known as *relative analgesia. Nitrous oxide was formerly referred to as laughing gas because of its tendency to excite the patient when used alone.

NIV see noninvasive ventilation.

nizatidine n. an H2-receptor antagonist (see antihistamine) used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers and prevent their recurrence and to treat *gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Side-effects include diarrhoea, dizziness, sweating, and headache.

NMC see Nursing and Midwifery Council.

NMDA receptor a receptor on synapses that binds the *neurotransmitter glutamate and also binds its *agonist NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). This receptor is involved in learning, memory, mood, and cognition; its overactivity is associated with chronic pain. NMDA-receptor antibodies are associated with an *encephalitis preceded by psychiatric symptoms, often in patients with ovarian malignancy (teratoma). NMDA-receptor antagonists (e.g. *amantadine, *memantine hydrochloride, *riluzole) are used in the treatment of (among other conditions) epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic pain syndromes.

NMP22 nuclear matrix protein 22, which is involved in DNA replication and gene expression. Significantly elevated levels of NMP22 have been detected in the urine of patients with bladder cancer, which can aid the diagnosis of primary cancer or identify recurrent cancer. The test has a higher *sensitivity but lower specificity in comparison with urine cytology.

NMR see nuclear magnetic resonance.

Nocardia n. a genus of rodlike or filamentous Gram-positive nonmotile bacteria found in the soil. As cultures age, filaments form branches, but these soon break up into rodlike or spherical cells. Three or more spores may form in each cell; these germinate to form filaments. Some species are pathogenic: N. asteroides causes *nocardiosis and N. madurae is associated with the disease *Madura foot.

nocardiosis n. a disease caused by bacteria of the genus Nocardia, primarily affecting the lungs, skin, and brain, resulting in the formation of abscesses. Treatment involves antibiotics and sulphonamides.

noci- combining form denoting pain or injury.

nociceptive adj. describing nerve fibres, endings, or pathways that are concerned with the condition of pain.

noct- (nocti-) combining form denoting night.

nocturia n. the passage of urine at night. In the absence of a high fluid intake, sleep is not normally interrupted by the need to pass urine. Nocturia usually occurs in elderly men or women. In younger men or women, less urine is made at night than during the day, but this rhythm is lost with age in both sexes. Men may have additional problems arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland), but transurethral resection of the prostate often does not reduce nocturia.

node n. a small swelling or knot of tissue. See atrioventricular node; lymph node; sinoatrial node.

node of Ranvier one of the gaps that occur at regular intervals in the *myelin sheath of medullated nerve fibres, between adjacent *Schwann cells.

It causes progressive and mutilating tissue degradation and destruction of bone and soft tissue in the infected areas of the face and jaws. It is rare in countries with working infrastructures and is usually found in debilitated or malnourished individuals.

nonaccidental injury (NAI) injury inflicted on babies and young children; the perpetrator is usually an adult – often a parent or step-parent. Most commonly seen in babies aged six months or less, it usually takes the form of bruising, particularly on the face; bite marks; burns or scalds, particularly cigarette burns; and bone injuries, especially spiral fractures of the long bones in the limbs and skull fractures. Internal injuries may be fatal. Careful examination often reveals several injuries of different ages, indicating long-term abuse. NAI usually has serious consequences for the child, including *failure to thrive and behavioural problems.

Known colloquially as the battered baby (or child) syndrome, it may be precipitated by many factors, including relationship difficulties, social problems, and ill health, and is more common if the child is physically or mentally disabled. It is often found that abusers suffered similar abuse themselves when young. Many abused children suffer further injury if discharged into the same environment with no support (see also risk register). A child at considerable risk may need to be removed from the family home.

nonadherence n. see adherence.

nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) a spectrum of conditions affecting the liver in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD is a common cause of referral for patients with abnormal liver function tests. Fatty liver is excessive fat accumulation in the liver seen as an area of brightness within the liver on ultrasound examination. Fatty liver does not lead to irreversible liver damage in the majority of cases. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is inflammation of the liver associated with accumulation of fat. It is often linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and *metabolic syndrome. Treatment involves dietary modification, regular physical exercise, weight reduction, and management of underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, and hiperlipidaemia). NASH may predispose to *cirrhosis and may ultimately require liver transplantation.

noncompaction n. a congenital condition in which the myocardium has a spongelike appearance with only a thin rim of functioning heart muscle. This is normal in the fetus but when it persists into childhood or adult life heart failure commonly ensues, although the age of onset and severity are very variable.

nondisjunction n. a condition in which pairs of homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis or a chromosome fails to divide at *anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. It results in a cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes (see monosomy; trisomy).

non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) a condition characterized by episodes that resemble epileptic seizures but lack the abnormal electrical activity in the brain typically associated with *epilepsy. See non-epileptic seizure.

non-epileptic seizure n. an event with symptoms that mimic an epileptic seizure but that does not involve abnormal discharges of cortical neurons that would be captured on an EEG. It can be caused by both physiological and psychological conditions. Physiological causes include syncopes, cataplexy, migraine, narcolepsy, parasomnias, and tics. Psychological non-epileptic seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, can arise from acute distress or anxiety or in the context of a *somatic symptom. People who suffer from epilepsy may have non-epileptic seizures as well. The main visible difference between a non-epileptic seizure and an epileptic seizure is that the former commonly lasts longer than two minutes and can last up to 30 minutes. Also there is occasional pelvic thrusting, the patient’s eyes and mouth are typically closed, and side-to-side head movements are more common than in epileptic seizures. Crying or talking during the attack is possible. There is no *postictal phase. Other names for non-epileptic seizures include pseudo seizures, functional seizures, and conversion seizures.

non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma see lymphoma.

noninvasive adj. 1. denoting techniques of investigation or treatment that do not involve penetration of the skin by needles or knives. 2. denoting tumours that do not spread into surrounding tissues (see benign).

noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) see prenatal diagnosis.

noninvasive ventilation (NIV) mechanical assistance with breathing that does not require the insertion of an endotracheal tube (see intubation). In noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) air is blown into the lungs through a close-fitting mask: designs range from helmet-like devices to nasal cushions and full-face or nasal masks (see also Nippy). A ventilator then applies positive pressure to the mask in a cyclical fashion. The technique simplifies the process of ventilation in respiratory failure and reduces or eliminates the need for paralysis and anaesthesia, which are required for endotracheal intubation. See also BiPAP; continuous positive airways pressure.

Negative-pressure ventilation involves the use of devices that draw air into and out of the lungs noninvasively by applying negative pressure in a cyclical way (see ventilator).

nonmaleficence n. one of the *four principles and common to many theories of medical ethics: doctors should avoid causing harm to patients (see primum non nocere). As almost all medical interventions carry some risk of harm, however small, in practice a doctor should avoid risking unnecessary harm or any harm that is disproportionate to the benefit intended. Consequently, risks should be minimized and considered along with the intended benefits when evaluating specific interventions. Harm can include psychological, emotional, or social harm as well as physical damage. Compare beneficence.

nonsecretor n. a person in whose body fluids it is not possible to detect soluble forms of the A, B, or O agglutinogens that determine blood group. Compare secretor.

non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) any type of lung cancer other than *small-cell lung cancer. Such cancers include *adenocarcinoma of the lung, large-cell carcinomas, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung.

Noonan’s syndrome an autosomal *dominant condition of males who have all or some of the physical features of *Turner’s syndrome in females but normal sex chromosomes. It is often associated with a low testosterone level and sometimes with reduced sperm production. Other features include cardiovascular defects and most affected individuals have short stature and mild learning disabilities. [J. Noonan (1928– ), US paediatrician]

noradrenaline (norepinephrine) n. a hormone, closely related to *adrenaline and with similar actions, secreted by the medulla of the *adrenal gland and also released as a *neurotransmitter by sympathetic nerve endings. Among its many actions are constriction of small blood vessels leading to an increase in blood pressure, increased blood flow through the coronary arteries and a slowing of the heart rate, increase in the rate and depth of breathing, and relaxation of the smooth muscle in intestinal walls.

norepinephrine n. see noradrenaline.

norethisterone n. a synthetic female sex hormone (see progestogen) administered by mouth to treat menstrual disorders, including endometriosis. Its main use, however, is in contraceptives, either alone or in combination with an oestrogen; it is also used in *hormone replacement therapy.

norfloxacin n. a *quinolone antibiotic used for treating urinary-tract infections. Side-effects are those of the other quinolones.

norma n. a view of the skull from one of several positions, from which it can be described or measured. For example the norma lateralis is a side view of the skull; the norma verticalis is the view of the top of the skull.

normal distribution see distribution; significance.

normalization n. (in psychiatry) the process of making the living conditions of people with learning disabilities as similar as possible to those of people who are not disabled. This includes moves to living outside institutions and encouragement to cope with work, pay, social life, sexuality, and civil rights.

normative adj. describing a statement about what is or is not desirable (based on accepted standards or norms), as opposed to a statement of what is or is not the case (based on evidence and fact). This distinction between normative and positive statements is of basic importance in medical *ethics.

normo- combining form denoting normality.

normoblast n. a nucleated cell that forms part of the series giving rise to the red blood cells and is normally found in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow. Normoblasts pass through three stages of maturation: early (or basophilic), intermediate (or polychromatic), and late (or orthochromatic) forms. See also erythroblast; erythropoiesis.

normotensive adj. describing the state in which the arterial blood pressure is within the normal range. Compare hypertension; hypotension.

norovirus (Norwalk virus) n. a member of a group of RNA viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. The faecal–oral route is the typical mode of transmission. Symptoms appear after an incubation period of between 24 and 48 hours. Noroviruses are highly contagious and are implicated in over 50% of all outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Symptomatic treatment with fluid replacement and electrolyte correction remains the mainstay of treatment.

Northern blot analysis a technique for identifying a specific form of messenger RNA in cells. It uses a gene *probe known to match the RNA being sought. Compare Southern blot analysis; Western blot analysis.

nortriptyline n. a tricyclic *antidepressant drug that is used to relieve depression and treat neuropathic pain. Side-effects may include dry mouth and drowsiness.

nose n. the organ of olfaction, which also acts as an air passage that warms, moistens, and filters the air on its way to the lungs. The external nose is a triangular projection in the front of the face that is composed of cartilage and covered with skin. It leads to the nasal cavity (internal nose), which is lined with mucous membrane containing olfactory cells and is divided into two chambers (fossae) by the nasal septum. The lateral wall of each chamber is formed by the three scroll-shaped *nasal conchae, below each of which is a groovelike passage (meatus). The *paranasal sinuses open into these meatuses.

nosebleed n. see epistaxis.

noso- combining form denoting disease.

nosocomial infection (hospital infection) an infection that originates in a hospital. It may develop in a hospitalized patient or a member of the hospital staff, or it may be acquired in hospital but only develops after discharge. Such infections include those caused by fungi and opportunist bacteria. They are aggravated by factors favouring the spread of organisms (cross-contamination), such as insufficient hand washing among medical staff, and by reduced resistance of individual patients, as well as by antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria (see Clostridium; Enterococcus; MRSA).

nosology n. the naming and classification of diseases.

Nosopsyllus n. a genus of fleas. The common rat flea of temperate regions, N. fasciatus, will, in the absence of rats, bite humans and may therefore transmit plague or murine typhus from an infected rat population. The rat flea is also an intermediate host for the larval stage of two tapeworms, *Hymenolepis diminuta and H. nana.

nostrils n. see nares.

notch n. (in anatomy) an indentation, especially one in a bone.

NOTES (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery) an emerging technique of performing laparoscopic abdominal operations with access to the abdominal cavity via natural orifices (e.g. the mouth, rectum, vagina, or urethra), thereby avoiding abdominal wall incisions.

notifiable disease a disease that must be reported to a proper officer of the local authority so that prompt control and preventive action may be undertaken if necessary. The ‘proper officer’ duty is often delegated by local authorities to a *Consultant in Health Protection within *Public Health England. Notifiable diseases in England include anthrax, diphtheria, food poisoning, malaria, measles, rabies, tetanus, tuberculosis, and whooping cough. The list varies for different countries, including the other parts of the United Kingdom. Some diseases are internationally notifiable through the *World Health Organization; these include cholera, plague, relapsing fever, typhus, and yellow fever. The appropriate reporting of notifiable diseases is legally required by the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 (and similar legislation in the other parts of the UK).

NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) any one of a large group of drugs used for pain relief, particularly in rheumatic disease associated with inflammation but also in dysmenorrhoea and metastatic bone disease. NSAIDs act by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) responsible for controlling the formation of *prostaglandins, which are important mediators of inflammation. They include *aspirin, *ibuprofen, *ketoprofen, and *naproxen. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration. Some NSAIDs act by selectively inhibiting COX-2 and are therefore less likely to cause gastric side-effects (see COX-2 inhibitor).

NSFs see national service frameworks.

NSIP nonspecific *interstitial pneumonia.

NSTEMI non-S–T elevation *myocardial infarction.

NTDs see neglected tropical diseases.

nucha n. the nape of the neck. —nuchal adj.

nuchal translucency scanning (NT scanning) an ultrasound screening test performed during pregnancy at 11 weeks of gestation that measures the maximum thickness of the translucency between the skin and the soft tissue overlying the cervical (neck) region of the spine of the fetus. Increased NT is associated with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities and of a wide variety of structural abnormalities (e.g. heart defects). See also ultrasound marker.

nuclear cardiology the study and diagnosis of heart disease by the intravenous injection of different types of *radionuclide. The radionuclide emits gamma rays, enabling a gamma camera and computer to form an image of the heart. See MUGA scan; myocardial perfusion scan; SPECT scanning.

nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) the absorption and emission of high-frequency radio waves by the nuclei of certain elements when placed in a strong magnetic field. The strongest signal is obtained from hydrogen atoms, which are abundant in the water and organic molecules in the body. In clinical use for *magnetic resonance imaging, the signal is highly dependent on the concentration and mobility of water molecules within each tissue. NMR has important applications in noninvasive diagnostic techniques. See also magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

nuclear medicine a medical specialty in which *radionuclides (especially *technetium-99m) are used as *tracers to study the structure and function of organs of the body. The radionuclide is attached to a compound suitable for the particular test and then injected, inhaled, or ingested. When concentrated in the organ under investigation, the tracer can be imaged using a *gamma camera, revealing the structure or demonstrating the function of the organ. Alternatively, blood or urine samples may be analysed. See also nuclear cardiology.

nuclease n. an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of nucleic acids by cleaving the bonds between adjacent nucleotides. Examples are ribonuclease, which acts on RNA, and deoxyribonuclease, which acts on DNA.

nucleic acid either of two organic acids, *DNA or *RNA, present in the nucleus and in some cases the cytoplasm of all living cells. Their main functions are in heredity and protein synthesis.

Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are long chains of linked nucleotides (polynucleotide chains), which in DNA contain the purine bases adenine and guanine and the pyrimidines thymine and cytosine; in RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil.

nucleus n. 1. the part of a *cell that contains the genetic material, *DNA. The DNA, which is combined with protein, is normally dispersed throughout the nucleus as *chromatin. During cell division the chromatin becomes visible as *chromosomes. The nucleus also contains *RNA, most of which is located in the *nucleolus. The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope. 2. an anatomically and functionally distinct mass of nerve cells within the brain or spinal cord. 3. the central part of the lens of the eye, which is harder than the outer cortex.

nude mouse a mouse born without a thymus and therefore no T lymphocytes. Human tumours will often grow in these mice. For unknown reasons these mice are also hairless, hence the name.

nurse n. a person trained and experienced in nursing matters and entrusted with the care of the sick and the carrying out of medical and surgical routines. In Britain, student nurses gain a diploma or degree in nursing and must undertake a specified period of training in a hospital approved by the *Nursing and Midwifery Council before qualifying for registration as a general nurse. See also community midwife; district nurse; health visitor; nurse practitioner; practice nurse; school nurse.

nurse practitioner a registered nurse with advanced training and experience who assumes some of the duties and responsibilities formerly assumed only by a physician. Such nurses can practise in hospital or community settings within various domains of clinical activity, which may be condition-specific (e.g. diabetes, breast care), client-specific (e.g. children, the elderly, the homeless), or area-specific (e.g. general practice, dermatology).

Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) a statutory body that regulates the nursing and midwifery professions in the public interest. See nurse.

nursing home a residential facility that provides nursing supervision and limited medical care to individuals who do not require hospitalization.

nutation n. the act of nodding the head.

nutrient n. a substance that must be consumed in order to provide the essential components needed for growth and the maintenance of life. Nutrients include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. See also essential amino acid; essential fatty acid; trace element.

nutrition n. 1. the study of food in relation to the physiological processes that depend on its absorption by the body (growth, energy production, repair of body tissues, etc.). The science of nutrition includes the study of diets and of deficiency diseases. 2. the intake of nutrients and their subsequent absorption and assimilation by the tissues. Patients who cannot be fed in a normal way can be given nutrients by tubes into the gastrointestinal tract (see artificial nutrition and hydration; enteral feeding) or by infusion into a vein (intravenous feeding or parenteral nutrition; see total parenteral nutrition).

nutritional genomics the study of the relationships between the human genome, nutrition, and health. There are two main branches of study: nutrigenetics investigates how an individual’s genes affect their response to certain dietary nutrients, whereas nutrigenomics investigates how nutrients ingested can modulate gene expression. In time, nutrigenomics may help to identify the aetiology of certain chronic diseases.

nux vomica the seed of the tree Strychnos nux-vomica, which contains the poisonous alkaloid *strychnine.

On emerging from the eggs, nymphs resemble the adult insects except that they are smaller, do not have fully developed wings, and are not sexually mature. 2. the late larval stage of a tick.

nympho- combining form denoting 1. the labia minora. 2. female sexuality.

nystagmus n. rapid involuntary movements of the eyes, which may be from side to side, up and down, rotatory, or a mixture. Nystagmus may be congenital and associated with poor sight; it also occurs in disorders of the part of the brain responsible for eye movements and their coordination (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and in disorders of the organ of balance in the ear or the associated parts of the brain. Certain drugs, especially in excessive doses (e.g. phenytoin), also cause nystagmus. Optokinetic nystagmus occurs in normal people when they try to look at a succession of objects moving quickly across their line of sight. Jerking eye movements sometimes occur in normal people when tired, on concentrating their gaze in any direction. These are called nystagmoid jerks and they do not imply disease.

nystagmus block syndrome a type of squint (convergent *strabismus) that results from the use of the convergence mechanism to block or dampen down *nystagmus in an attempt to improve visual acuity.

nystatin n. an antifungal drug used especially to treat skin, oral, and intestinal infections caused by Candida. Side-effects include mild digestive upsets.

obeseogenic adj. referring to an environment that predisposes to *obesity, generally because of factors that encourage over-consumption of food or low levels of physical activity.

obesity n. the condition in which excess fat has accumulated in the body, in both the subcutaneous and visceral tissues. Clinical obesity is defined as a *body mass index of 30 or over. A waist circumference of greater than 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women is a strong predictor of a person developing additional medical conditions associated with obesity. The accumulation of fat is usually caused by the consumption of more food than is required for producing enough energy for daily activities. There is ongoing research into how much obesity is due to genetics and how much to environmental factors. Hunger and satiety appear to be controlled by peptide messengers, encoded by specific genes and acting on the brain; an example is *leptin. Treatment includes traditional weight reduction diets; surgery, such as gastric banding or gastric bypass; and drug treatment (*orlistat). Obesity is now seen as the precursor of lethal conditions such as cancer and diabetes, making it a global public health issue. —obese adj.

obex n. the curved lower margin of the fourth *ventricle of the brain, between the medulla oblongata and the cerebellum.

objective n. (in microscopy) the lens or system of lenses in a light microscope that is nearest to the object under examination and furthest from the *eyepiece. In many types of microscope interchangeable objectives with different powers of magnification are provided.

objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) a type of examination used increasingly in the health sciences (medicine, dentistry, nursing, physiotherapy, pharmacy) to assess clinical skills in examination, communication, medical procedures, and interpretation of results. The examination usually takes the form of a circuit of stations around which each candidate moves after a specified time interval (5–10 minutes) at each station. Stations are a mixture of interactive and noninteractive tasks. Some have an examiner and a simulated patient, either an actor for assessment of communication or history-taking skills or a manikin of a specific part of the body (e.g. to demonstrate how to use an auriscope). Other stations have investigation results with a list of questions that are to be completed on computer-marked examination papers. Each station has a different examiner and the stations are standardized with specific marking criteria, thus enabling fairer comparison with peers.

obligate adj. describing an organism that is restricted to one particular way of life; for example, an obligate parasite cannot exist without a host. Compare facultative.

obligation n. see duty.

obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD, King–Kopetzky syndrome) hearing difficulty, especially in noisy environments, in an individual with a normal *audiogram: a form of *auditory processing disorder. Treatment includes *hearing therapy.

observer error see validity.

obsession n. a recurrent thought, feeling, or impulse that is unpleasant and provokes anxiety but cannot be eliminated. Although an obsession dominates the person, he (or she) realizes its senselessness and struggles to resist it: this resistance causes anxiety. It is a feature of *obsessive–compulsive disorder and sometimes of depression and of organic states, such as encephalitis. —obsessional adj.

obsessional traits see anankastic.

obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) a mental illness prevalent in about 1% of the adult population but more common in children. Males are most commonly affected. The affected person has *obsessions or *compulsions he or she recognizes as senseless. Resisting the obsession causes anxiety, which is relieved by giving in to the compulsion. The obsession may, for example, be a vivid image, a fear (e.g. of contamination), or an impulse (e.g. to wash the hands repetitively). In severe cases obsessions and rituals can take over many hours of a person’s life each day. The condition can be treated with behaviour therapy and antidepressant medication, particularly clomipramine and SSRIs. *Psychosurgery is still a rare option in very severe and treatment-resistant cases.

obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) a spectrum of injuries that encompasses both third- and fourth-degree *perineal tears. Injury to the anal sphincter mechanism during childbirth may arise secondarily to direct disruption of the sphincter muscles and/or traction of the pudendal nerves. Disruption of the anal sphincter muscles is best assessed by anal ultrasound examination. This is usually performed using a high-frequency (10 MHz) endoanal probe. In selected cases with complex injury and/or suspected rectovaginal *fistula, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be employed.

obstetric cholestasis a pregnancy-related condition characterized by intense *pruritus (itch) – and consequent sleep deprivation – in the absence of a skin rash, with abnormal liver function tests and elevated bile acids, all of which remit following delivery. The clinical importance of obstetric cholestasis lies in the potential fetal risks, which may include prematurity and intrauterine death.

obstetrics n. the branch of medical science concerned with the care of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the period of about six weeks following the birth, when the reproductive organs are recovering. Compare gynaecology. —obstetric adj. —obstetrician n.

obstipation n. Chiefly US. severe or absolute constipation, usually with intestinal obstruction.

obstructed labour failure of the presenting part to descend in spite of uterine contractions, which implies a mechanical cause. Obstruction is usually due to (1) an abnormality in the woman’s pelvis (a contracted pelvis); (2) an abnormality in her baby (e.g. hydrocephaly); or (3) an abnormality in the relationship between them, either (a) an abnormal *lie (e.g. transverse) or *malpresentation, or (b) *cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). CPD and impacted transverse lie are the most important causes. Much of the purpose of antenatal care is to screen mothers who are at risk from obstructed labour, which can be detected early by means of a *partogram. If undetected, it can lead to rupture of the uterus, death of the fetus, obstetric fistulae, or maternal death.

obstructive airways disease see bronchospasm.

obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, OSAS) a serious condition in which airflow from the nose and mouth to the lungs is restricted during sleep, also called sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS). It is defined by the presence of more than five episodes of *apnoea per hour of sleep associated with significant daytime sleepiness. Snoring is a feature of the condition but it is not universal. There are significant medical complications of prolonged OSA, including heart failure and high blood pressure. Patients perform poorly on driving simulators, and driving licence authorities may impose limitations on possession of a driving licence. There are associated conditions in adults, the *hypopnoea syndrome and the upper airways resistance syndrome, with less apnoea but with daytime somnolence and prominent snoring. In children the cause is usually enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids and treatment is by removing these structures. In adults the tonsils may be implicated but there are often other abnormalities of the pharynx, and patients are often obese. Treatment may include weight reduction or nasal *continuous positive airways pressure (nCPAP) devices, *mandibular advancement splints, or noninvasive ventilation. Alternatively *tonsillectomy, *uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, *laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, or *tracheostomy may be required.

obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) see obstructive sleep apnoea.

The defect may result from removal of a tumour or, less commonly, be congenital, as in a cleft palate.

obturator foramen a large opening in the *hip bone, below and slightly in front of the acetabulum. See also pelvis.

obturator muscle either of two muscles that cover the outer surface of the anterior wall of the pelvis (the obturator externus and obturator internus) and are responsible for lateral rotation of the thigh and movements of the hip.

obtusion n. the weakening or blunting of normal sensations. This may be associated with disease.

occipital bone a saucer-shaped bone of the *skull that forms the back and part of the base of the cranium. At the base of the occipital are two occipital condyles: rounded surfaces that articulate with the first (atlas) vertebra of the backbone. Between the condyles is the foramen magnum, the cavity through which the spinal cord passes.

occiput n. the back of the head. In obstetrics, the occiput is used as a *denominator when a fetus presents by the vertex (see presentation). The most favourable position for delivery is occipitoanterior (or occipital anterior), with the occiput of the fetus presenting towards the anterior aspect of the maternal pelvis as it enters the pelvic inlet. In the occipitotransverse (or occipital transverse) and occipitoposterior (or occipital posterior) positions, the occiput presents towards the lateral and posterior aspects, respectively, of the maternal pelvis; these are *malpositions. —occipital adj.

occlusal adj. (in dental anatomy) denoting or relating to the biting surface of a premolar or molar tooth.

occlusal rim the occlusal extension of a denture base to allow analysis of jaw relations and to record jaw relations for the construction of *dentures, bridges, and extensive crowning.

occlusion n. 1. the closing or obstruction of a hollow organ or part. 2. (in dentistry) the relation of the upper and lower teeth when they are in contact. Maximum contact between the teeth is known as intercuspal (or centric) occlusion. See also malocclusion.

occult adj. not apparent to the naked eye; not easily determined or detected. For example occult blood is blood present in such small quantities that it can only be detected microscopically or by chemical testing. See faecal occult blood test.

occupational disease a disease to which workers in certain occupations are particularly prone. Industrial diseases, associated with a particular industry or group of industries, fall within this category. Examples of such diseases include the various forms of *pneumoconiosis, which affect the lungs of workers continually exposed to dusty atmospheres; cataracts in glassblowers; decompression sickness in divers; poisoning from toxic metals in factory and other workers; and infectious diseases contracted from animals by farm workers, such as woolsorter’s disease (see anthrax). See also coshh, prescribed disease; industrial injuries disablement benefit.

occupational health service (OHS) a scheme by which employers provide a mainly preventive health service for employees. Specially trained doctors and nurses advise management on hazardous situations at work. Advice is also given to management to ensure that people with ill health or disability are not prevented from taking up employment and on the potential for rehabilitating employees with prolonged or repeated sickness absence. Instruction may be given to the workforce on simple first aid procedures, and *health promotion programmes may be offered in relation to nutrition, physical activity, and stress. With the approval of the *Health and Safety Executive, the OHS may conduct routine tests on employees working with potentially hazardous substances, such as lead. See also coshh.

occupational mortality rates and causes of death in relation to different jobs, occupational and socioeconomic groups, or social class. Because some occupations have older incumbents than others (e.g. judges) allowance for age bias is made by comparing either *standardized mortality ratios for those aged 15–64 years or related but less familiar indices, such as comparative mortality figures or proportional mortality ratios.

occupational therapy the treatment of physical and psychiatric conditions by encouraging patients to undertake specific selected activities that will help them to reach their maximum level of function and independence in all aspects of daily life. These activities are designed to make the best use of the patient’s capabilities and are based on individual requirements. They range from woodwork, metalwork, and printing to pottery and other artistic activities, household management, social skills, and leisure activities. Occupational therapy also includes assessment for mechanical aids and adaptations in the home.

OCD see obsessive–compulsive disorder.

ochronosis n. the presence of brown-black pigment in the skin, cartilage, and other tissues due to the abnormal accumulation of homogentisic acid that occurs in the metabolic disease *alcaptonuria.

ocriplasmin n. a recombinant protease with activity against components of the interface between the retina and the vitreous humour, used for treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion. It works by dissolving the proteins that link the vitreous to the macula in this condition, thus preventing posterior detachment of the vitreous from the retina (see retinal detachment).

OCT see optical coherence tomography.

oct- (octa-, octi-, octo-) combining form denoting eight.

octreotide n. a somatostatin analogue (see somatostatin).

ocular adj. of or concerned with the eye or vision.

ocular hypertension (OHT) a constantly raised intraocular pressure (greater than 21 mmHg by Goldmann applanation *tonometry) registered on two or more occasions in one or both eyes with the absence of evidence of optic nerve damage or visual field defect. Intraocular pressure increases slowly with age and OHT can increase the risk of developing glaucoma. It is treated with eye drops and surgery if indicated.

oculist n. a former name for an *ophthalmologist.

oculo- combining form denoting the eye(s).

oculogyric adj. causing or concerned with movements of the eye.

oculomotor adj. concerned with eye movements.

oculomotor nerve the third *cranial nerve (III), which is composed of motor fibres distributed to muscles in and around the eye. Fibres of the parasympathetic system are responsible for altering the size of the pupil and the lens of the eye. Fibres outside the eye run to the upper eyelid and to muscles that turn the eyeball in different directions.

oculonasal adj. concerned with the eye and nose.

oculoplastics n. a surgical specialty concerned with reconstructive and cosmetic surgery around the eye (including the orbit, eyelids, lacrimal apparatus, and other accessory structures).

oculoplethysmography n. measurement of the pressure inside the eyeball. A rising or above-normal pressure is an important indication of the presence of *glaucoma.

odds ratio a measure of the association between an exposure and an outcome, calculated by comparing the odds of the outcome of interest in those who are given and those who are not given exposure with the outcome of interest. It is most commonly used in *case control studies.

odont- (odonto-) combining form denoting a tooth. Example: odontalgia (toothache).

odontoblast n. one of the cells in the pulp of a tooth that form dentine. Odontoblasts line the pulp and have small processes that extend into the dentine. The process of dentine formation is known as *dentinogenesis.

odontogenic tumour any one of a group of neoplasm tumour-like malformations arising from odontogenic tissues or their remnants. The most important example is the *ameloblastoma.

odontoid process a toothlike process from the upper surface of the axis vertebra. See cervical vertebrae.

odontology n. the study of the teeth.

odontome n. an abnormal mass of calcified dental tissue, which usually represents a developmental abnormality. Compare hamartoma.

-odynia combining form denoting pain in (a specified part).

odynophagia n. painful swallowing. This may be due to severe inflammation of the gullet (see oesophagitis) or infection as by such as cytomegalovirus, candidiasis, or herpes simplex virus in an immunocompromised patient. Other causes include neuromuscular disease, such as *achalasia, foreign bodies, such as impacted fish bones, and malignancy.

oedema n. excessive accumulation of fluid in the body tissues: historically known as dropsy. The resultant swelling may be local, as with an injury or inflammation, or more general, as in heart or kidney failure. In generalized oedema there may be collections of fluid within the chest cavity (pleural effusions), abdomen (see ascites), or within the air spaces of the lung (pulmonary oedema). It may result from heart or kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver, acute nephritis, the nephrotic syndrome, starvation, allergy, or drugs (e.g. cortisone steroids). In such cases the kidneys can usually be stimulated to get rid of the excess fluid by the administration of *diuretic drugs. Subcutaneous oedema commonly occurs in the legs and ankles due to the influence of gravity and (in women) before menstruation; the swelling subsides with rest and elevation of the legs. —oedematous adj.

Oedipus complex in *Freudian theory, repressed sexual feelings of a child for its opposite-sexed parent, combined with rivalry towards the same-sexed parent: said to be a normal stage of development. The end of the Oedipus complex in children is marked by a loss of sexual feelings towards the opposite-sexed parent and an increase in identification with the same-sexed parent. Arrest of development at the Oedipal stage is said to be responsible for sexual deviations and other neurotic behaviour.

oesophag- (oesophago-) combining form denoting the oesophagus. Example: oesophagectomy (surgical removal of).

oesophageal ulcer see peptic ulcer; oesophagitis.

oesophageal varices dilated veins in the lower oesophagus due to *portal hypertension. Varices have a high risk of bleeding, resulting in life-threatening *haematemesis. Bleeding may be arrested by band ligation (or banding): an endoscopic technique in which rubber bands are applied to the base of a bleeding varix. Injection of sclerosants into bleeding varices is an older technique not now widely used. Failure to stop variceal bleeding at endoscopy may require the insertion of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (a compression balloon). Nonendoscopic treatments for variceal bleeding include antibiotics and vasoactive agents (such as *terlipressin or octreotide).

oesophagitis n. inflammation of the oesophagus (gullet). Frequent regurgitation of acid and peptic juices from the stomach causes reflux oesophagitis, the commonest form, which may be associated with a hiatus *hernia. The main symptoms are heartburn, acid regurgitation, *odynophagia, and sometimes difficulty in swallowing (*dysphagia). Complications include bleeding, *stricture formation, and *Barrett’s oesophagus. It is treated with antacids and by maintaining an upright position, using more pillows at night, eating the evening meal earlier in the day, weight loss, and dietary restraint. In severe cases *fundoplication surgery may be required. Corrosive oesophagitis is caused by the ingestion of caustic acid or alkali. It is often severe and may lead to perforation of the oesophagus and extensive stricture formation. Immediate treatment includes food avoidance and antibiotics; later, stricture dilatation is often needed. Infective oesophagitis is most commonly due to a fungus (Candida) infection in debilitated or immunocompromised patients, especially those being treated with antibiotics, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressant drugs, but is occasionally due to viruses (such as cytomegalovirus or herpesvirus). Eosinophilic oesophagitis is a poorly understood condition characterized by infiltration of the oesophageal lining by excess *eosinophils. Autoimmune disease and food allergy are two commonly proposed causes. Treatment is directed towards exclusion of allergens and oral or inhaled steroids.

oesophagocele n. protrusion of the lining (mucosa) of the oesophagus (gullet) through a tear or weakness in its muscular wall.

oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) n. endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract using a fibreoptic or video instrument. See also gastroscope.

oesophagoscope n. an illuminated optical instrument used to inspect the interior of the oesophagus (gullet), dilate strictures, obtain material for biopsy, or remove a foreign body. It may be a rigid metal tube or a flexible fibreoptic or video-camera instrument (see gastroscope). —oesophagoscopy n.

Oesophagostomum n. a genus of parasitic nematodes occurring in Brazil, Africa, and Indonesia. It is a rare intestinal parasite of humans, producing symptoms of dysentery in cases of heavy infection. The worms may also invade the tissues of the gut wall, giving rise to abscesses. The worms can be eliminated with anthelmintics.

oesophagostomy n. a surgical operation in which the oesophagus (gullet) is opened onto the neck. It is usually performed after operations on the throat as a temporary measure to allow feeding.

oesophagotomy n. surgical opening of the oesophagus (gullet) in order to inspect its interior or to remove or insert something.

oesophagus n. the gullet: a muscular tube, about 23 cm long, that extends from the pharynx to the stomach. It is lined with mucous membrane, whose secretions lubricate food as it passes from the mouth to the stomach. Waves of *peristalsis assist the passage of food.

Diseases of the oesophagus include *achalasia, carcinoma, hiatus hernia, *oesophageal varices, *oesophagitis, and *peptic ulcer. —oesophageal adj.

oestradiol n. the major female sex hormone produced by the ovary. See oestrogen.

oestriol n. one of the female sex hormones produced by the ovary. See oestrogen.

oestrogen n. one of a group of steroid hormones (including oestriol, oestrone, and oestradiol) that control female sexual development, promoting the growth and function of the female sex organs (see menstrual cycle) and female secondary sexual characteristics (such as breast development). Oestrogens are synthesized mainly by the ovary; small amounts are also produced by the adrenal cortex, testes, and placenta. In men excessive production of oestrogen gives rise to *feminization.

Naturally occurring and synthetic oestrogens are used to treat *amenorrhoea and menopausal symptoms (see hormone replacement therapy), as well as androgen-dependent cancers (e.g. cancer of the prostate). Synthetic oestrogens are a major constituent of *oral contraceptives. Side-effects of oestrogen therapy may include nausea and vomiting, headache and dizziness, irregular vaginal bleeding, fluid and salt retention, and feminization in men. Oestrogens should not be used in patients with a history of cancer of the breast, uterus, or genital tract. —oestrogenic adj.

oestrogen receptor a specific site on the surface of a cell that binds to *oestrogen; the binding triggers responses of the cell to the hormone (see receptor). Oestrogen receptors occur on all target cells normally responsive to oestrogen (e.g. in the uterus) and are also found on some cancer cells, particularly in breast cancer. Oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells rely on oestrogen to grow and are therefore susceptible to *anti-oestrogen therapy, which prevents oestrogen from binding to these receptors. This type of cancer tends to have a better prognosis than oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer.

oestrogen-receptor antagonist see anti-oestrogen.

oestrone n. one of the female sex hormones produced by the ovary. See oestrogen.

Oestrus n. a genus of widely distributed nonbloodsucking flies, occurring wherever sheep and goats are raised. The parasitic larvae of O. ovis, the sheep nostril fly, may occasionally and accidentally infect humans. By means of large mouth hooks, it attaches itself to the conjunctiva of the eye, causing a painful *myiasis that may result in loss of sight. This is an occupational disease of shepherds. Larvae can be removed with forceps following anaesthesia.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) (in Britain) an executive agency of the Treasury that was formed in 1996. It is responsible for the compilation and publication of statistics relating to national and local populations, including their social and economic situation and contribution to the economy, and the demographic patterns of births, marriages, and deaths (including the medical cause of death). The ONS organizes a national *census at ten-yearly intervals.

Omalizumab acts by binding to IgE, an *immunoglobulin that mediates the allergic response.

omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 fatty acids) polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the third carbon atom in the chain. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain development and are also associated with many health benefits, including protection against heart disease and possibly stroke and inflammatory conditions. There are three major types: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The main source of EPA and DHA is fish oils. Vegetarians rely on EPA and DHA being synthesized by the body from dietary sources of ALA. See also essential fatty acids.

omentectomy n. the surgical removal of all or part of the omentum (the fold of peritoneum between the stomach and other abdominal organs). In infracolic omentectomy the lower section of the greater omentum is excised as part of the management of ovarian or bowel cancer. It enables accurate staging and optimal reduction of the cancer.

omentum (epiploon) n. a double layer of *peritoneum attached to the stomach and linking it with other abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen, and intestine. The greater omentum is a highly folded portion of the omentum, rich in fatty tissue, that covers the intestines in an apron-like fashion. It acts as a heat insulator and prevents friction between abdominal organs. The lesser omentum links the stomach with the liver. —omental adj.

Onchocerca n. a genus of parasitic worms (see filaria) occurring in central Africa and central America. The adult worms are found in fibrous nodules within the connective tissues beneath the skin and their presence causes disease (see onchocerciasis). Various species of black fly, in which Onchocerca undergoes part of its development, transmit the infective larvae to humans.

onchocerciasis n. a tropical disease of the skin and underlying connective tissue caused by the parasitic worm *Onchocerca volvulus. Fibrous nodular tumours grow around the adult worms in the skin; these may take several months to appear, and if secondary bacterial infection occurs they may degenerate into abscesses. The skin also becomes inflamed and itches. The migration of the *microfilariae into the eye can cause total or partial blindness – called river blindness in Africa. Onchocerciasis occurs in Africa and Central and South America. *Ivermectin is used in treatment; if possible, the nodules are removed as and when they appear.

oocyst n. a spherical structure, 50–60 μm in diameter, that develops from the zygote (see ookinete) of the malarial parasite (Plasmodium) on the outer wall of the mosquito’s stomach. The oocyst steadily grows in size and its contents divide repeatedly to form *sporozoites, which are released into the body cavity of the mosquito when the oocyst bursts.

oocyte n. a cell in the ovary that undergoes *meiosis to form an ovum. Primary oocytes develop from *oogonia in the fetal ovary as they enter the early stages of meiosis. Only a fraction of the primary oocytes survive until puberty, and even fewer will be ovulated. At ovulation the first meiotic division is completed and a secondary oocyte and a polar body are formed. Fertilization stimulates the completion of the second meiotic division, which produces a second polar body and an ovum.

oocyte donation (egg donation) the transfer of secondary *oocytes from one woman to another. Possible recipients include women with primary or secondary ovarian failure or severe genetic disorders, and women in whom ovulation has been suppressed as an incidental result of drug treatment for another condition (e.g. cancer). Pregnancy rates are higher than with *in vitro fertilization.

oogenesis n. the process by which mature ova (egg cells) are produced in the ovary (see illustration). Primordial germ cells multiply to form *oogonia, which start their first meiotic division to become *oocytes in the fetus. This division is not completed until each oocyte is ovulated. The second division is only completed on fertilization. Each meiotic division is unequal, so that one large ovum is produced with a much smaller polar body.

Oogenesis.





oogonium n. (pl. oogonia) a cell produced at an early stage in the formation of an ovum (egg cell). Primordial germ cells that have migrated to the embryonic ovary multiply to form numerous small oogonia. After the fifth month of pregnancy they enter the early stages of the first meiotic division to form the *oocytes. See also oogenesis.

ookinete n. the motile elongated *zygote of the malarial parasite (*Plasmodium), formed after fertilization of the *macrogamete. The ookinete bores through the lining of the mosquito’s stomach and attaches itself to the outer wall, where it later forms an *oocyst.

ophthalmitis n. inflammation of the eye. See conjunctivitis; uveitis.

ophthalmodynamometry n. measurement of the blood pressure in the vessels of the retina of the eye. A small instrument is pressed against the eye until the vessels are seen (through an *ophthalmoscope) to collapse. The pressure recorded by the instrument reflects the pressure within the vessels of the retina. In certain disorders of the blood circulation to the eye, the pressure in the vessels is reduced and the vessels can be made to collapse by a lower than normal pressure on the eyeball.

ophthalmologist n. a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases.

ophthalmology n. the branch of medicine that is devoted to the study and treatment of eye diseases. —ophthalmological adj.

ophthalmometer n. see keratometer.

ophthalmoplegia n. paralysis of the muscles of the eye. Internal ophthalmoplegia affects the muscles inside the eye: the iris (which controls the size of the pupil) and also the ciliary muscle (which is responsible for *accommodation). External ophthalmoplegia affects the muscles moving the eye. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a progressive disease of the extrinsic eye muscles leading to *ptosis and then paralysis of the muscles; eye movements become increasingly frozen in the primary position. Ophthalmoplegia may accompany *exophthalmos due to thyrotoxicosis. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), due to a lesion in the brainstem, is seen, for example, in patients with multiple sclerosis or stroke.

ophthalmoscope n. an instrument for examining the interior of the eye. There are two types. The direct ophthalmoscope enables a fine beam of light to be directed into the eye and at the same time allows the examiner to see the spot where the beam falls inside the eye. Examiner and subject are very close together. In the indirect ophthalmoscope an image of the inside of the eye is formed between the subject and the examiner; it is this image that the examiner sees. The examiner and subject are almost an arm’s length apart. A scanning laser ophthalmoscope uses a scanning camera, rather than a human observer, to view the inside of the eye. —ophthalmoscopy n.

ophthalmotonometer n. see tonometer.

-opia combining form denoting a defect of the eye or of vision. Example: asthenopia (eyestrain).

opiate n. strictly, one of a group of drugs derived from opium, including *morphine, *codeine, and *heroin (diacetylmorphine). The term may be used more loosely to include, in addition, synthetic drugs with similar effects, such as *methadone and *buprenorphine; in this case the term opioid is usually preferred. Opiates depress the central nervous system: they relieve pain, induce feelings of euphoria, suppress coughing, and stimulate vomiting. Because prolonged use can lead to *tolerance and *dependence, opioid *analgesics are reserved for the relief of moderate or severe pain; other side-effects include drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression of breathing.

opisth- (opistho-) combining form denoting 1. dorsal; posterior. 2. backwards.

opisthorchiasis n. a condition caused by the presence of the parasitic fluke *Opisthorchis in the bile ducts. The infection is acquired through eating raw or undercooked fish that contains the larval stage of the parasite.

opsonization n. the process by which opsonins render foreign organisms or particles more attractive to *phagocytes by attaching to their outer surfaces and changing their physical and chemical composition. Phagocytic leucocytes express receptors for these opsonins and thereby engulf and digest foreign organisms or particles.

opt- (opto-) combining form denoting vision or the eye.

OCT is proving valuable in ophthalmology, for noninvasive imaging of the ocular structures, and in cardiology for visualizing the interior of coronary arteries using a specialized *catheter. See also spectral domain optical coherence tomography.

optic atrophy degeneration of the optic nerve. It may be secondary to disease within the eye or it may follow damage to the nerve itself resulting from injury or inflammation. It is visible as pallor of the optic nerve as viewed inside the eye with an ophthalmoscope.

optic chiasm (optic commissure) the X-shaped structure formed by the two optic nerves, which pass backwards from the eyeballs to meet in the midline beneath the brain, near the pituitary gland (see illustration). Nerve fibres from the nasal side of the retina of each eye cross over to join fibres from the lateral side of the retina of the opposite eye. The optic tracts resulting from the junction pass backwards to the occipital lobes.

optic cup either of the paired cup-shaped outgrowths of the embryonic brain that form the retina and iris of the eyes.

optic disc (optic papilla) the start of the optic nerve, where nerve fibres from the rods and cones leave the eyeball. See blind spot.

optic nerve the second *cranial nerve (II), which is responsible for vision. Each nerve contains about one million fibres that receive information from the rod and cone cells of the retina. It passes into the skull behind the eyeball to reach the *optic chiasm, after which the visual (or optic) pathway continues to the cortex of the occipital lobe of the brain on each side (see illustration).

Optic nerve. The visual (or optic) pathway.





optic neuritis see retrobulbar neuritis.

opticokinetic adj. relating to the movements of the eye.

optometer (refractometer) n. an instrument for measuring the *refraction of the eye. An autorefractor calculates the required spectacle lens correction automatically. Because the design and use of optometers is very complex, errors of refraction are usually determined using a *retinoscope.

oral adj. 1. relating to the mouth. 2. taken by mouth: applied to medicines, etc.

oral cavity the mouth.

oral contraceptive a tablet containing one or more synthetic female sex hormones, taken by women to prevent conception. Most oral contraceptives are combined pills, consisting of an *oestrogen, which blocks the normal process of ovulation, and a *progestogen, which acts on the pituitary gland to block the normal control of the menstrual cycle. Progestogens also alter the lining of the uterus and the viscosity of mucus in its outlet, the cervix, so that conception is less likely should ovulation occur. These pills are taken every day for three weeks and then stopped for a week, during which time menstruation occurs. Side-effects may include headache, weight gain, nausea, skin changes, and depression. There is also a small risk that blood clots may form in the veins, especially those of the legs (which may lead to *pulmonary embolism), or that prolonged use of hormonal contraceptives may reduce fertility. The unwanted pregnancy rate is less than 1 per 100 woman-years. With progestogen-only pills (sometimes known as minipills) the unwanted pregnancy rate is slightly higher (1–2 per 100 woman-years) but there are fewer side-effects (due to the absence of oestrogen).

Other hormonal contraceptives include injections and implants (see contraception). See also postcoital contraception.

oral hypoglycaemic drug (oral antihyperglycaemic drug) one of the group of drugs that reduce the level of glucose in the blood and are taken by mouth for the treatment of type 2 *diabetes mellitus. They include the *sulphonylurea group (e.g. glibenclamide, gliclazide), metformin (a *biguanide), *alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, *meglitinides, *thiazolidinediones, *DPP-IV inhibitors, and *SGLT-2 inhibitors.

A radical orchidectomy, using an incision in the inguinal region, is performed for malignant tumours within the testis (usually germ-cell tumours, such as *seminoma or *teratoma). Orchidectomy may also be performed for *infarction of the testis. Removal of both testes (bilateral orchidectomy: see castration) causes sterility and reduces levels of testosterone by 90%, which is an effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer.

orchidometer n. a calliper device for measuring the size of the testicles. The Prader orchidometer consists of a collection of testicle-shaped beads of different sizes, each of known volume, for direct comparison to and sizing of the testicles. It enables the precise charting of testicular growth.

orchidopexy n. the operation of mobilizing an undescended testis in the groin and fixing it in the scrotum. The operation should be performed ideally before two years of age to allow the testis every chance of normal development (see cryptorchidism).

orchidotomy n. an incision into the testis, usually done to obtain *biopsy material for histological examination, particularly in men with few or no sperm in their semen (see azoospermia; oligospermia). See also tesa.

orchitis n. inflammation of the testis. This causes pain, redness, and swelling of the scrotum, and may be associated with inflammation of the epididymis (epididymo-orchitis). The condition may affect one or both testes; it is usually caused by infection spreading down the vas deferens but can develop in mumps. Mumps orchitis affecting both testes after puberty may result in reduced testicular size and abnormalities in semen analysis, although sterility is rare. Treatment of epididymo-orchitis is by local support and by administration of analgesics and antibiotics; mumps orchitis often responds to *corticosteroids.

-osis suffix denoting 1. a diseased condition. Examples: nephrosis (of the kidney); leptospirosis (caused by Leptospira species). 2. any condition. Example: narcosis (of stupor). 3. an increase or excess. Example: leucocytosis (of leucocytes).

Osler–Rendu–Weber disease (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia) a hereditary (autosomal *dominant) disorder characterized by thinning of the blood vessel walls, resulting in abnormally wide and fragile blood vessels. Patients may develop telangiectasia (see telangiectasis), nosebleeds, and arteriovenous malformations (see angioma). It is caused by mutations in the endoglin (ENG) gene or the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK-1) gene. [Sir W. Osler (1849–1919), Canadian physician; H. J. M. Rendu (1844–1902), French physician; F.

osmiophilic adj. describing a tissue that stains readily with osmium tetroxide.

osmium tetroxide (osmic acid) a colourless or faintly yellowish compound used to stain fats or as a *fixative in the preparation of tissues for microscopical study. Osmium tetroxide evaporates readily, the vapour having a toxic action on the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.

osmolality n. the concentration of body fluids (e.g. plasma, urine) measured in terms of the amount of dissolved substances per unit mass of water. It is usually given in units of mOsm kg−1 or Osm/l. Symbol: Os or osmol.

osmolar gap the difference between the measured serum osmolality and the calculated osmolality using the following formula:



It is an aid to the diagnosis of severe *anion gap acidoses. The normal range for the difference is ± 10 mOsm/kg. A high osmolar gap is normally due to the presence of acetone, mannitol, or an alcohol.

osmole n. a unit of osmotic pressure equal to the molecular weight of a solute in grams divided by the number of ions or other particles into which it dissociates in solution.

osmoreceptor n. a group of cells in the *hypothalamus that monitor blood concentration. Should this increase abnormally, as in dehydration, the osmoreceptors send nerve impulses to the hypothalamus, which then increases the rate of release of *vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland. Loss of water from the body in the urine is thus restricted until the blood concentration returns to normal.

osmosis n. the passage of a solvent from a less concentrated to a more concentrated solution through a *semipermeable membrane. This tends to equalize the concentrations of the two solutions. In living organisms the solvent is water and cell membranes function as semipermeable membranes, and the process of osmosis plays an important role in controlling the distribution of water. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the pressure by which water is drawn into it through the semipermeable membrane; the more concentrated the solution (i.e. the more solute molecules it contains), the greater its osmotic pressure. —osmotic adj.

osseointegration n. the process by which certain materials, such as titanium, may be introduced into living bone without producing a foreign-body reaction. This allows a very tight and strong joint between the two structures. Osseointegration is used, for example, to fix certain types of dental *implants and *bone-anchored hearing aids.

osseous adj. bony: applied to the bony parts of the inner ear (cochlea, semicircular canals, labyrinth).

ossicle n. a small bone. The auditory ossicles are three small bones (the incus, malleus, and stapes) in the middle *ear. They transmit sound from the outer ear to the labyrinth (inner ear).

ossification (osteogenesis) n. the formation of *bone, which takes place in three stages by the action of special cells (osteoblasts). A meshwork of collagen fibres is deposited in connective tissue, followed by the production of a cementing polysaccharide. Finally the cement is impregnated with minute crystals of calcium salts. The osteoblasts become enclosed within the matrix as osteocytes (bone cells). In intracartilaginous (or endochondral) ossification the bone replaces cartilage. This process starts to occur soon after the end of the second month of embryonic life. Intramembranous ossification is the formation of a *membrane bone (e.g. a bone of the skull). This starts in the early embryo and is not complete at birth (see fontanelle).

ost- (oste-, osteo-) combining form denoting bone. Examples: ostalgia (pain in); osteocarcinoma (carcinoma of); osteonecrosis (death of); osteoplasty (plastic surgery of).

ostectomy n. the surgical removal of a bone or a piece of bone. See also osteotomy.

osteitis n. inflammation of bone, due to infection, damage, or metabolic disorder. Osteitis fibrosa cystica refers to the characteristic cystic changes that occur in bones during long-standing *hyperparathyroidism. See also Paget’s disease.

osteo- combining form. see ost-.

osteoarthritis (osteoarthrosis) n. a degenerative disease of joints resulting in loss of the articular cartilage, remodelling of adjacent bone, and inflammation. It can be primary or it can occur secondarily to abnormal load to the joint or damage to the cartilage from inflammation or trauma. The joints become painful and stiff with restricted movement. Osteoarthritis is recognized on X-ray by narrowing of the joint space (due to loss of cartilage) and the presence of *osteophytes, *osteosclerosis, and cysts in the bone. The condition is treated with analgesics, by reducing the load to the joint by weight loss or the use of a walking stick, or surgically by *osteotomy, *arthrodesis, or *arthroplasty.

osteoarthropathy n. any disease of the bone and cartilage adjoining a joint. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is characterized by the formation of new bony tissue and occurs as a complication of chronic diseases of the chest, including pulmonary abscess, mesothelioma, and lung cancer.

osteoarthrosis n. see osteoarthritis.

osteoarthrotomy n. surgical excision of the bone adjoining a joint.

osteoblast n. a cell, originating in the mesoderm of the embryo, that is responsible for the formation of *bone. See also ossification.

osteochondritis (osteochondrosis) n. any one of a group of conditions affecting areas of growth at the *epiphyses and *apophyses of bones before skeletal maturity. Symptoms of localized pain and swelling are most common during periods of rapid growth in early adolescence. There are three types of osteochondritis: crushing (see Köhler’s disease; Kienböck’s disease; Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease; Scheuermann’s disease); splitting (see osteochondritis dissecans); and pulling (see Osgood-Schlatter disease; Sever’s disease).

osteochondritis dissecans the development of a small area of avascular bone on the surface of a joint, most commonly the knee, which typically occurs in males aged between 10 to 20 years. Sometimes the area with its overlying articular cartilage can become loose and may eventually detach. Symptoms include activity-related pain, localized tenderness, stiffness, and swelling. In children, spontaneous healing may occur, but adults usually require surgery to reattach or remove the fragment.

osteochondroma a bony protuberance covered by a cap of cartilage arising usually from the end of a long bone, most commonly around the knee or shoulder. It is due to overgrowth of cartilage at the edge of the *physis (growth plate) of growing bones. The protuberance may be flattened (sessile) or stalklike (see exostosis) and usually appears before the age of 30, with patients complaining of either pain or a lump. There is a small incidence (1–2% in solitary lesions, higher if multiple) of malignant transformation of the cartilage cap into a *chondrosarcoma. If the lump causes symptoms or continues to grow in an adult, it should be excised.

osteochondrosis n. see osteochondritis.

osteoclasia (osteoclasis) n. 1. (osteoclasty) the deliberate breaking of a malformed or malunited bone, carried out by a surgeon to correct deformity. 2. dissolution of bone through disease (see osteolysis).

osteoclasis n. 1. remodelling of bone by *osteoclasts, during growth or the healing of a fracture. 2. see osteoclasia.

osteoclast n. 1. a large multinucleate cell that resorbs calcified bone. Osteoclasts are only found when bone is being resorbed and may be seen in small depressions on the bone surface. 2. a device for fracturing bone for therapeutic purposes.

osteoclastoma n. a rare tumour of bone, caused by proliferation of *osteoclast cells.

osteocyte n. a bone cell: an *osteoblast that has ceased activity and has become embedded in the bone matrix.

osteodystrophy n. any generalized bone disease resulting from a metabolic disorder. In renal osteodystrophy chronic kidney failure leads to diffuse bone changes resulting from a number of factors, including osteomalacia, secondary *hyperparathyroidism stimulated by hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, acidosis from the renal failure, and metastatic calcification related to high levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. See also Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy.

osteogenesis n. see ossification.

osteogenesis imperfecta (OI, fragilitas ossium, brittle bone disease) a congenital disorder of connective tissue formation that affects bone, teeth, and soft tissues. It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000 and there are at least eight types, of varying severity, the worst being lethal at birth. Most types are inherited as autosomal *dominant characteristics. In all types the bones are brittle and fracture easily; the *sclerae may be blue and teeth are often deformed. See also dentinogenesis (imperfecta).

osteogenic adj. arising in, derived from, or composed of any of the tissues that are concerned with the production of bone. An osteogenic sarcoma (see osteosarcoma) affects bone-producing cells.

osteology n. the study of the structure and function of bones and related structures.

osteolysis (osteoclasia) n. dissolution of bone through disease, commonly by infection or by loss of the blood supply (ischaemia) to the bone. In acro-osteolysis the terminal bones of the fingers or toes are affected: a common feature of some disorders involving blood vessels (including *Raynaud’s disease), *scleroderma, and systemic *lupus erythematosus.

osteoma a benign bone tumour, of which there are two types. An osteoid osteoma most commonly occurs in the shaft of the femur or tibia. It is small, solitary, and relatively common; its characteristic feature is that it causes nocturnal pain that is relieved by aspirin. Treatment is by surgical excision. A compact osteoma (ivory exostosis) is a slow-growing tumour-like mass that usually causes no symptoms. Such tumours are relatively uncommon, occurring usually in the skull and facial bones. If they do cause symptoms, usually from local compression, they may be excised.

osteomalacia n. softening of the bones due to inadequate mineralization: it is the adult counterpart of *rickets. Causes include insufficient calcium absorption from the intestine due to dietary deficiency or vitamin D deficiency, the latter resulting from lack of sunshine, intestinal malabsorption, liver or kidney disease, or anticonvulsant medication. The most common symptoms are bone pain, backache, and muscle weakness. The characteristic X-ray finding is a thin transverse radiolucent band (a Looser zone) in an otherwise normal-looking bone. Treatment usually involves large doses of vitamin D.

osteomeatal complex see ostiomeatal complex.

osteomyelitis n. inflammation of bone due to infection. Acute osteomyelitis occurs when bacteria enter the bone via the bloodstream and is more common in children. There is severe pain, tenderness, and redness over the involved bone, accompanied by general illness and high fever. Treatment is by antibiotics, and surgical drainage and curettage are often required. Chronic osteomyelitis may develop from partially treated acute osteomyelitis or after open fractures or surgery during which the bone is contaminated; tuberculosis is an occasional cause. Osteomyelitis can cause fracture and deformity of the bone.

osteonecrosis n. death of bony tissue, usually adjacent to a joint surface where it is enclosed by avascular cartilage. It is usually caused by loss of blood supply (avascular necrosis) due to trauma and is a definitive feature in a variety of conditions, including *Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, *sickle-cell disease, *Gaucher’s disease, epiphyseal infection and fractures, alcohol abuse, and high-dosage corticosteroids. Sites that are particularly susceptible include the head of the femur, the scaphoid and lunate bones of the wrist, the *capitulum of the humerus, and the talus and navicular bones of the ankle. In its earliest stages there is localized pain without any changes visible on X-ray examination; a *bone scan or MRI will assist with diagnosis.

osteopathy n. a system of diagnosis and treatment based on the theory that many diseases are associated with disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Diagnosis and treatment of these disorders involve palpation, manipulation, and massage. Osteopathy provides relief for many disorders of bones and joints, especially those producing back pain. —osteopath n. —osteopathic adj.

osteopenia n. a condition in which bone mineral density is lower than normal, but less severe than *osteoporosis (see T score). It may be generalized or localized, due to inflammation.

osteopetrosis (Albers-Schönberg disease, marble-bone disease) n. a congenital abnormality in which bones become abnormally dense and brittle and tend to fracture. Affected bones appear unusually opaque to X-rays. In severe forms, which are inherited as autosomal *recessive characteristics, the bone marrow is obliterated, causing anaemia and infections. Mild forms show autosomal *dominant inheritance. Treatment is by bone marrow transplantation. See also osteosclerosis.

osteophyte n. a projection of bone, usually shaped like a rose thorn, that occurs at sites of cartilage degeneration or destruction near joints and intervertebral discs. Osteophyte formation is an X-ray sign of *osteoarthritis but is not a cause of symptoms in itself.

osteoporosis n. a bone disease characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density and bone mass, resulting in bones that are liable to fracture. Infection, injury, and *synovitis can cause localized osteoporosis of adjacent bone. Generalized osteoporosis is common in older people, and in women it often follows the menopause. It is also a feature of *Cushing’s syndrome and prolonged steroid therapy. Osteoporosis can be detected by *quantitative digital radiography, ultrasound, and *DEXA scans. A diet with adequate calcium, together with exercise, are preventative, and several drugs, including *bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and *denosumab, can be used to reduce the risk of fracture.

osteosarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma) n. a highly malignant tumour arising from within a bone, usually in the *metaphysis of the long bones of the body and especially around the knee and the proximal end of the humerus. It is usually seen in children and adolescents but can occur in adults of all ages, occasionally in association with *Paget’s disease of bone. In children the usual site for the tumour is the leg, particularly the femur. Secondary growths (metastases) are common, most frequently in the lungs (though other sites, such as the liver, may also be involved). The symptoms are usually pain and swelling at the site of the tumour and there is often a history of preceding trauma, although it is doubtful whether this contributes to the cause. Treatment of disease localized to the primary site was traditionally by amputation of the limb; limb-sparing surgery is now possible after *neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with replacement of the diseased bone by a metal prosthesis. Many centres also give *adjuvant therapy in an attempt to kill any microscopic tumour that might have already spread. The drugs used include doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate.

osteosclerosis n. an abnormal increase in the density of bone, as a result of poor blood supply, chronic infection, or tumour. The affected bone is more opaque to X-rays than normal bone. See also osteopetrosis.

osteotome n. a surgical chisel designed to cut bone (see illustration).

An osteotome.





osteotomy n. a surgical operation to cut a bone into two parts, followed by realignment of the ends to allow healing. The operation is performed to reduce pain and disability in an arthritic joint, by changing the biomechanics of the joint, for cases in which conservative treatment has failed. Osteotomy of the jaws is performed to improve severe discrepancies in jaw relation.

ostiomeatal complex (osteomeatal complex) the part of the *paranasal sinuses where the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses communicate with the interior of the nose, which is affected in chronic *rhinosinusitis. *Endoscopic sinus surgery is often aimed at improving the function of this region.

otic adj. relating to the ear.

otic capsule the cup-shaped cartilage in the head of an embryo that later develops into the bony *labyrinth of the ear.

otitis n. inflammation of the ear. Otitis externa is inflammation of the canal between the eardrum and the external opening of the ear (the external auditory meatus). Myringitis is inflammation of the eardrum, often due to viral infection. Acute otitis media is inflammation, usually due to viral or bacterial infection, of the middle ear (the chamber lying behind the eardrum and containing the three bony ossicles that conduct sound to the inner ear). Symptoms include pain and a high fever. Treatment is with antibiotics and sometimes also by surgical drainage (*myringotomy). Secretory otitis media (or otitis media with effusion) is a chronic accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, causing hearing loss (see glue ear). Chronic otitis media (COM) is chronic inflammation of the middle ear associated with perforations of the eardrum and in some instances with *cholesteatoma. The treatment involves surgical repair of perforations (*myringoplasty) or removal of the air cells in the mastoid bone (*mastoidectomy). Chronic otitis media was previously known as chronic suppurative otitis media but the terminology was changed as the formation of pus is not an inevitable part of the condition. See also labyrinthitis.

otoacoustic emissions (OAE, Kemp echoes) tiny sounds that emerge from the inner ear either spontaneously (spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, SOAE) or shortly after the ear is exposed to an external sound (evoked otoacoustic emissions, EOAE). An objective test of hearing has been developed using otoacoustic emissions. The test equipment creates a small sound and then detects any response from the ear. This can be done using a click stimulus (transient otoacoustic emissions, TOAE) or two separate tones (distortion product otoacoustic emissions, DPOAE). A normal response suggests that the ear is functioning and that hearing is satisfactory. All newborn children in the UK are now screened using this technique.

otoconium n. see otolith.

otocyst n. a small cavity in the mesoderm of the head of an embryo that later develops into the membranous *labyrinth of the ear.

otopostasis see protruding ears.

otorhinolaryngology n. the study of ear, nose, and throat diseases (i.e. ENT disorders).

otorrhagia n. bleeding from the ear.

otorrhoea n. any discharge from the ear, commonly a purulent discharge in chronic middle ear infection (*otitis media).

otosclerosis (otospongiosis) n. a disorder causing conductive *deafness in adult life. An overgrowth of the bone of the inner ear leads to the third ear ossicle (the stapes) becoming fixed to the fenestra ovalis, which separates the middle and inner ears, so that sounds cannot be conducted to the inner ear. Deafness is progressive and may become very severe, but treatment by surgery is usually highly effective (see fenestration; stapedectomy). Nonsurgical treatments include fluoride tablets and the provision of suitable *hearing aids.

otoscope n. see auriscope.

otospongiosis n. see otosclerosis.

ototoxic adj. having a toxic effect on the organs of balance or hearing in the inner ear or on the vestibulocochlear nerve. Ototoxic drugs may be used in the treatment of *Ménière’s disease. —ototoxicity n.

outbreeding n. the production of offspring by parents who are not closely related. Compare inbreeding.

outer ear the pinna and the external auditory meatus of the *ear.

out-of-hours (in general practice) denoting the period from 6.30 pm to 8.00 am on weekdays and the whole of weekends, bank holidays, and public holidays. Most GPs use a deputizing service to provide health-care services during the out-of-hours period. See general practitioner.

out-of-body experience a form of *derealization in which there is a sensation of leaving one’s body, sometimes accompanied by visions of travel. It typically occurs after anaesthesia or severe illness and is often attributed to *anoxia of the brain.

out-patient n. a patient who receives treatment at a hospital, either at a single attendance or at a series of attendances, but is not admitted to a bed in a hospital ward. Large hospitals have *clinics at which out-patients with various complaints can be given specialist treatment. Compare in-patient.

out-toe gait (out-toeing) a foot deformity in which the forefoot points outward, usually presenting in the first or second year of life. Most children are born with external rotation contractures of the hips and this resolves shortly after walking begins. In some children out-toeing is caused by outward twisting of the tibia or femur; this is more common in children with neuromuscular abnormalities.

oval window see fenestra.

ovari- (ovario-) combining form denoting the ovary.

ovarian cancer a malignant tumour of the ovary, usually a carcinoma. Because of its wide-ranging pathology and an imperfect understanding of its causes, ovarian cancer is not readily detected in the early stages of development, when the tumour is small and produces few suspicious symptoms. Increased susceptibility to the disease is associated with raised serum levels of *CA125 (see also risk of malignancy index; BRCA1 and BRCA2). Diagnosis is based on the finding of a solid or cystic mass arising from the pelvis; there may be associated *ascites. The incidence of ovarian cancer reaches a peak in postmenopausal women; treatment involves surgery and most cases also require combined chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

ovarian cyst a benign tumour of the ovary, of which there are many varieties. The most common is a follicular cyst, resulting from growth of a *Graafian follicle that fails to ovulate or from involution of a mature follicle. It may rupture, causing pain. A luteal cyst occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle, which then becomes a *corpus luteum; instead of breaking down if a pregnancy does not occur, it fills with blood or fluid. Two-thirds of luteal cysts involve the right ovary and rupture occurs most commonly between days 20 and 28. The symptoms are not severe and settle spontaneously. Although most ovarian cysts are not malignant, they may reach a very large size, causing gross swelling of the abdomen and pressure on surrounding organs. The cyst may rotate on its stalk, thus cutting off its blood supply and causing severe abdominal pain and vomiting (ovarian torsion). In this case the cyst requires urgent surgical removal. Ovarian cysts that do become malignant may not be recognized until the tumour has advanced to a stage where treatment may be unsuccessful in eradicating the cancer. Screening programmes, based on ultrasound techniques, and *CA125 estimation, have been introduced in some areas to assist with the early detection of ovarian cysts and tumours.

ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome a potentially life-threatening condition classically associated with ovarian stimulation using gonadotrophins in assisted conception procedures, such as in vitro fertilization (see superovulation). It is characterized by gross enlargement of the ovaries resulting in pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, *haemoconcentration, and *ascites. The most severe cases require intensive care due to the high risk of thromboembolism and acute respiratory distress.

ovariectomy n. see oophorectomy.

ovariotomy n. literally, incision of an ovary. However, the term commonly refers to surgical removal of an ovary (*oophorectomy).

ovaritis n. see oophoritis.

ovary n. the main female reproductive organ, which produces ova (egg cells) and steroid hormones in a regular cycle (see menstrual cycle) in response to hormones (*gonadotrophins) from the anterior pituitary gland. There are two ovaries, situated in the lower abdomen, one on each side of the uterus (see reproductive system). Each ovary contains numerous follicles, within which the ova develop (see illustration), but only a small proportion of them reach maturity (see Graafian follicle; oogenesis). The follicles secrete *oestrogen and small amounts of androgen. After ovulation a *corpus luteum forms at the site of the ruptured follicle and secretes progesterone. Oestrogen and progesterone regulate the changes in the uterus throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. —ovarian adj.

Ovary. A section of the ovary showing ova in various stages of maturation.





overactive bladder syndrome see detrusor.

overbite n. the vertical overlap of the upper incisor teeth over the lower ones.

overcompensation n. (in psychology) the situation in which a person tries to overcome a disability by making greater efforts than are required. This may result in the person becoming extremely efficient in what he (or she) is trying to achieve; alternatively, excessive overcompensation may be harmful to the person.

overdiagnosis n. making more diagnoses in an individual case than is necessary or appropriate. As few people are in absolutely perfect health, it is usually possible to find a notional extra condition. This is considered to be bad medicine and ethically questionable.

overjet n. the horizontal overlap of the upper incisor teeth in front of the lower ones.

overt adj. plainly to be seen or detected: applied to diseases with observable signs and symptoms, as opposed to those whose presence may not be suspected for years despite the fact that they cause insidious damage. An infectious disease becomes overt only at the end of an incubation period.

over-the-counter drug (OTC drug) a drug that may be purchased directly from a pharmacist without a doctor’s prescription. Current government policy is to extend the range of OTC drugs: a number have already been derestricted (e.g. ibuprofen, ranitidine) and this trend is increasing, which will place an additional advisory responsibility on pharmacists.

overtube n. a semirigid plastic tube (25–45 cm long) designed to fit over the shaft of an *endoscope in order to minimize the risk of trauma. It can be used with a *gastroscope, *cholangioscope, *enteroscope, or colonoscope (see colonoscopy). An overtube is placed over the shaft of an endoscope prior to its insertion; once the endoscope is in the desired place, the overtube is lubricated and slid into position over the shaft. It is commonly used in combination with a gastroscope for the removal of ingested foreign bodies (especially those with sharp or serrated edges that may cause significant trauma as they are being extracted).

ovi- (ovo-) combining form denoting an egg; ovum.

oviduct n. see Fallopian tube.

ovulation n. the process by which an ovum is released from a mature *Graafian follicle. The fluid-filled follicle distends the surface of the ovary until a thin spot breaks down and the ovum floats out surrounded by a cluster of follicle cells (the cumulus oophoricus) and starts to travel down the Fallopian tube to the uterus. Ovulation is stimulated by the secretion of *luteinizing hormone by the anterior pituitary gland.

ovum (egg cell) n. the mature female sex cell (see gamete). The term is often applied to the secondary *oocyte although this is technically incorrect. The final stage of meiosis occurs only when the oocyte has been activated by fertilization.

A mature ovum (magnification about ×600).





oxalic acid an extremely poisonous acid, C2H2O4. It is a component of some bleaching powders and is found in many plants, including sorrel and the leaves of rhubarb.

oxygen n. an odourless colourless gas that makes up one-fifth of the atmosphere. Oxygen is essential to most forms of life in that it combines chemically with glucose (or some other fuel) to provide energy for metabolic processes. It is absorbed into the blood from air breathed into the lungs. Oxygen is administered therapeutically in various conditions in which the tissues are unable to obtain an adequate supply through the lungs (see oxygenator; tent). Symbol: O.

oxygenator n. a machine that oxygenates blood outside the body. It is used together with pumps to maintain the patient’s circulation while he or she is undergoing open heart surgery (see heart-lung machine) or to improve the circulation of a patient with heart or lung disorders that lower the amount of blood oxygen.

oxygen deficit a physiological condition that exists in cells during periods of temporary oxygen shortage. During periods of violent exertion the body requires extra energy, which is obtained by the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen, after the available oxygen has been used up. The breakdown products are acidic and cause muscle pain. The oxygen required to get rid of the breakdown products (called the oxygen deficit) must be made available after the exertion stops.

oxygen tent see tent.

oxyhaemoglobin n. the bright-red substance formed when the pigment *haemoglobin in red blood cells combines reversibly with oxygen. Oxyhaemoglobin is the form in which oxygen is transported from the lungs to the tissues, where the oxygen is released. Compare methaemoglobin.

oxyntic cells see parietal cells.

oxytetracycline n. an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, including Chlamydia and mycoplasmas, and acne. Side-effects are those of the other *tetracyclines.

oxytocic n. any agent that induces or accelerates labour by stimulating the muscles of the uterus to contract. See also oxytocin.

oxytocin n. a hormone, released by the pituitary gland, that causes contraction of the uterus during labour and stimulates milk flow from the breasts by causing contraction of muscle fibres in the milk ducts. Intravenous infusions or injections of oxytocin are used to induce labour and to control or prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Combined with *ergometrine, oxytocin is used to control bleeding after incomplete miscarriage or abortion, or for active management of the third stage of labour.

oxyuriasis n. see enterobiasis.

Oxyuris n. see threadworm.

ozaena n. a disorder of the nose in which the mucous membranes inside the nose become atrophied, with the production of an offensive discharge and crusts.

ozone n. a poisonous gas containing three oxygen atoms per molecule. Ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent and is formed when oxygen or air is subjected to electric discharge. Ozone in the troposphere (the atmospheric layer closest to the earth’s surface), as found in photochemical smog, can cause health problems. Ozone at very high altitudes (the ozone layer) is responsible for absorbing a large proportion of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Without this absorption by ozone the earth would be subjected to a lethal amount of ultraviolet radiation.





p


p53 n. a tumour-suppressor gene located on chromosome 17. p53 protein binds DNA, which stimulates genes involved in suppressing division and inducing *apoptosis. Mutations of p53 result in uncontrolled division of cells and formation of tumours; they occur in breast, skin, and various other cancers.

PA see posteroanterior.

Pacchionian body see arachnoid villus. [A. Pacchioni (1665–1726), Italian anatomist]

pacemaker n. 1. a device used to produce and maintain a normal heart rate in patients who have *bradycardia. The unit consists of a battery that stimulates the heart through one or more insulated electrode wires (*leads) attached to the surface of the ventricle (epicardial pacemaker) or lying in contact with the lining of the heart (endocardial pacemaker). The pacemaker senses when the natural heart rate falls below a predetermined value and then stimulates the heart (demand pacemaker). A pacemaker may be used as a temporary measure with an external battery or it may be permanent, when the whole apparatus is surgically implanted under the skin. In most cases the right atrium and right ventricle are paced (dual-chamber pacing), but in a proportion of patients only right ventricular (single-chamber) pacing is required. 2. the part of the heart that regulates the rate at which it beats: the *sinoatrial node.

pack n. a pad of folded moistened material, such as cotton-wool, applied to the body or inserted into a cavity.

packed cell volume (haematocrit) the volume of the red cells (erythrocytes) in blood, expressed as a fraction of the total volume of the blood. The packed cell volume is determined by centrifuging blood in a tube and measuring the height of the red-cell column as a fraction of the total. Automated instruments calculate packed cell volume as the product of the erythrocyte count and the measured mean red cell volume (mean corpuscular volume; MCV).

pack years a measure of a person’s cumulative cigarette consumption over a long period of time. It is expressed as the number of packs (assuming 20 cigarettes in a pack) smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking:



For example, a patient who has smoked 15 cigarettes a day for 40 years has a (15/20) × 40 = 30 pack-year smoking history.

paclitaxel n. a *cytotoxic anticancer drug (see taxane). It is used mainly to treat ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and *non-small-cell lung cancer. Typical side-effects include damage to bone marrow (see myelosuppression), loss of hair, and peripheral neuropathy.

paed- (paedo-) combining form denoting children.

paediatric dentistry the branch of dentistry concerned with the oral health care of children and adolescents.

Paediatric reference values

paediatrics n. the general medicine of childhood. Handling the sick child requires a special approach at every age from birth (or preterm birth) to adolescence and also a proper understanding of parents. It also requires detailed knowledge of genetics, obstetrics, psychological development, management of disabilities at home and in school, and effects of social conditions on child health. The preventive measures associated with all these aspects of paediatrics are the concern of *public health consultants and *community paediatricians. See also child health clinic. —paediatrician n.

paedophilia n. sexual attraction to children (of either sex) that may cause deviant behaviour. Sexual activity with any children under the age of 16 is illegal in the UK for adults. Paedophiles who have been arrested may be forced to undergo treatment: *behaviour therapy can be used, although evidence of its efficacy is controversial. Occasionally, the offender’s sexual drive can be reduced by drug treatment. —paedophile n. —paedophilic adj.

Paget’s disease 1. a chronic disease of bones, occurring in the elderly and most frequently affecting the skull, backbone, pelvis, and long bones. Affected bones become thickened and their structure disorganized: X-rays reveal patchy *sclerosis. There are often no symptoms, but pain, deformity, and fracture can occur; when the skull is affected, blindness and deafness can occur due to nerve compression. There is a very small (1%) risk of malignant change (*osteosarcoma). Treatment is with *bisphosphonates. Medical name: osteitis deformans. 2. a malignant condition of the nipple, resembling eczema in appearance, associated with underlying infiltrating cancer of the breast. See also breast cancer. 3. an uncommon condition of the vulva characterized by an epithelial lesion that histologically resembles the lesion of Paget’s disease of the nipple. It may be associated with locally invasive *adenocarcinomas of the surrounding skin, as well as tumours at other sites. [Sir J. Paget (1814–99), British surgeon]

pain n. an unpleasant sensation ranging from mild discomfort to agonized distress, associated with real or potential tissue damage. Pain is a response to impulses from the peripheral nerves in damaged tissue, which pass to nerves in the spinal cord, where they are subjected to a gate control. This gate modifies the subsequent passage of the impulses in accordance with descending controls from the brain. Because attention is a crucial component of pain, distraction can act as a basis for pain therapy. On the other hand, anxiety and depression focus the attention and exaggerate the pain. If the nerve pathways are damaged, the brain can increase the amplification in the pathway, maintaining the sensation as a protective mechanism.

pain clinic a clinic that specializes in the management and relief of pain. Pain clinics are usually directed by anaesthetists.

painful bruising syndrome see Gardner–Diamond syndrome.

paint n. (in pharmacy) a liquid preparation that is applied to the skin or mucous membranes. Paints usually contain antiseptics, astringents, caustics, or analgesics.

palaeo- combining form denoting 1. ancient. 2. primitive.

palaeocerebellum n. the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. In evolutionary terms it is one of the earliest parts of the hindbrain to develop in mammals.

palaeostriatum n. see pallidum.

palaeothalamus n. the anterior and central part of the *thalamus, older in evolutionary terms than the lateral part, the neothalamus, which is well developed in apes and humans.

palatal myoclonus rhythmical contraction of the palatal muscles. There are two forms, ordinary and essential. Ordinary palatal myoclonus is idiopathic and can result in *pulsatile tinnitus. Essential palatal myoclonus has no link to pulsatile tinnitus but may be associated with lesions of the brainstem.

palate n. the roof of the mouth, which separates the mouth from the nasal cavity and consists of two portions. The hard palate, at the front of the mouth, is formed by processes of the maxillae and palatine bones and is covered by mucous membrane. The soft palate, further back, is a movable fold of mucous membrane that tapers at the back of the mouth to form a fleshy hanging flap of tissue – the uvula. —palatal adj.

palatine bone either of a pair of approximately L-shaped bones of the face that contribute to the hard *palate, the nasal cavity, and the orbits. See skull.

palato- combining form denoting 1. the palate. 2. the palatine bone.

palatoplasty n. surgery to alter the shape or physical characteristics of the palate. This can be plastic surgery of the roof of the mouth, usually to correct cleft palate or other defects present at birth. Other palatoplasty operations are carried out under local or general anaesthesia to shorten and/or stiffen the palate in the treatment of snoring or obstructive sleep apnoea. They may use conventional surgical techniques (*uvulopalatopharyngoplasty), laser (*laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty), insertion of stiffening materials, or injection of sclerosants. It is also possible to use radiofrequency energy in a process called radiofrequency palatal myoplasty (RPM), also known as somnoplasty.

palatorrhaphy n. see staphylorrhaphy.

pali- (palin-) combining form denoting repetition or recurrence.

palilalia n. a disorder of speech in which a word spoken by the individual is rapidly and involuntarily repeated. It is seen, with other tics, in *Tourette’s. It is also encountered when encephalitis or other processes damage the *extrapyramidal system of the brain.

paliphrasia n. repetition of phrases while speaking: a form of *stammering or a kind of *tic.

palliative 1. adj. providing relief from the symptoms of a disease but without effecting a cure. Although not curative, palliative chemotherapy may significantly extend life expectancy. Palliative care is used in the treatment of terminal illness where cure is impossible and many previously administered treatments have become burdensome to the patient. 2. n. a palliative medicine.

pallidotomy (pallidectomy) n. a neurosurgical operation to destroy or modify the effects of the globus pallidus (see basal ganglia), formerly used for the relief of *parkinsonism and other conditions in which involuntary movements are prominent before the advent of modern drug therapies. The development of more accurate techniques to localize the globus pallidus has led to a revival in its use: in the modern form of pallidotomy, a lesion is made in the globus pallidus by stereotactic surgery (see stereotaxy). New techniques achieving better results involve the implantation of stimulators (pallidal stimulation).

pallidum (palaeostriatum) n. one of the dense collections of grey matter, deep in each cerebral hemisphere, that go to make up the *basal ganglia.

pallium n. the outer wall of the cerebral hemisphere as it appears in the early stages of evolution of the mammalian brain. In the modern brain it corresponds to the *cerebral cortex.

palmar erythema reddening of the palms. This may be a variant of normal or a feature of pregnancy. It is also associated with chronic liver disease, connective tissue disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis), endocrine disorders (such as diabetes mellitus and thyrotoxicosis), certain infections, drugs, and smoking. There is no specific management for this condition.

Palmer’s point an entry site for minimal-access surgery (see laparoscopy), especially when there is an increased risk from previous abdominal surgery. It is located in the left upper quadrant (see abdomen), 3 cm below the middle of the left costal margin. See Veress needle.

palmitic acid see fatty acid.

palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia (hand–foot syndrome) a skin reaction marked by redness, numbness, and desquamation of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can be caused by many chemotherapy drugs, particularly fluorouracil and capecitabine, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment requires cessation of the drug.

palpation n. the process of examining part of the body by careful feeling with the hands and fingertips. Using palpation it is possible, in many cases, to distinguish between swellings that are solid and those that are cystic (see fluctuation). Palpation is also used to discover the presence of a fetus in the uterus (see ballottement).

palpebral adj. relating to the eyelid (palpebra).

palpitation n. an awareness of the heartbeat. This is normal with fear, emotion, or exertion. It may also be a symptom of neurosis, arrhythmias, heart disease, and overactivity of the circulation (as in thyrotoxicosis).

Pancoast syndrome pain and paralysis involving the lower branches of the brachial plexus due to infiltration by a malignant tumour of the apical region of the lung. *Horner’s syndrome may also be present. [H. K. Pancoast (1875–1939), US radiologist]

pancreas n. a compound gland, about 15 cm long, that lies behind the stomach. One end lies in the curve of the duodenum; the other end touches the spleen. It is composed of clusters (acini) of cells that secrete *pancreatic juice. This contains a number of enzymes concerned in digestion. The juice drains into small ducts that open into the pancreatic duct. This unites with the common *bile duct and the secretions pass into the duodenum. Interspersed among the acini are the *islets of Langerhans – isolated groups of cells that secrete the hormones *insulin and *glucagon into the bloodstream.

pancreas divisum a congenital abnormality in which the pancreas develops in two parts draining separately into the duodenum, the small ventral pancreas through the main ampulla and the larger dorsal pancreas through an accessory papilla. In rare instances this is associated with recurrent abdominal pain, probably due to inadequate drainage of the dorsal pancreas. Diagnosis is made by CT imaging, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or *ERCP.

pancreatectomy n. surgical removal of the pancreas. Total pancreatectomy (Whipple’s operation) involves excision of the entire gland and part of the duodenum. In subtotal pancreatectomy most of the gland is removed, usually leaving a small part close to the duodenum. In partial pancreatectomy only a portion of the gland is removed. Such operations are performed to remove tumours or tissue damaged by chronic or relapsing *pancreatitis. After total or subtotal pancreatectomy it is necessary to administer pancreatic enzymes with food to aid its digestion and insulin injections to replace that normally secreted by the gland.

pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) a therapeutic approach using supplements of the digestive enzymes lipase, amylase, and protease (Creon, Pancrex), which are given when there is insufficient endogenous production of pancreatic enzymes: for example, to patients with pancreatic cancer or cystic fibrosis. The capsules must be taken with all meals and snacks to be effective. PERT treats the symptoms of *steatorrhoea.

pancreatic juice the digestive juice secreted by the *pancreas. Its production is stimulated by hormones secreted by the duodenum, which in turn is stimulated by contact with food from the stomach. If the duodenum produces the hormone *secretin the pancreatic juice contains a large amount of sodium bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acidity of the stomach contents. Another hormone (see cholecystokinin) stimulates the production of a juice rich in digestive enzymes, including trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen (which are converted to *trypsin and *chymotrypsin in the duodenum), *amylase, *lipase, and *maltase.

pancreatic polypeptide a hormone released from the D cells of the *islets of Langerhans of the pancreas in response to protein in the small intestine. Its actions are to inhibit pancreatic bicarbonate and protein enzyme secretion and to relax the gall bladder. It belongs to a family of similar hormones that have actions on appetite and food metabolism.

pancreatin n. an extract obtained from the *pancreas, containing the pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatin is administered to treat conditions in which pancreatic secretion is deficient; for example, in pancreatitis.

pancreatitis n. inflammation of the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis is a sudden illness in which the patient experiences severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back. In severe cases, there is rapid deterioration with shock. Serum amylase levels are high. Its cause is not always discovered, but it may be associated with gallstones, alcoholism, drugs, infection, autoimmune disease, or recent interventions (such as ERCP). Complications include the formation of *pseudocysts, abscesses, necrosis (necrotizing pancreatitis), and haemorrhage (haemorrhagic pancreatitis). Treatment consists of restricting oral intake, intravenous hydration, and antibiotics if infected necrosis is present. In severe cases, *pancreatectomy may be required to remove necrosed tissue. Relapsing pancreatitis, in which the above symptoms are recurrent and less severe, may be associated with gallstones or alcoholism; prevention is by removal of gallstones and avoidance of alcohol and fat. Chronic pancreatitis may produce symptoms similar to relapsing pancreatitis or may be painless; it can lead to endocrine failure causing *malabsorption and *diabetes mellitus. The pancreas often becomes calcified, producing visible shadowing on X-rays. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a recently described condition in which an autoimmune process leads to inflammation and swelling of the pancreas. Although abdominal pain is minimal or absent, jaundice is usually present. Radiologically it is characterized by diffuse ‘sausage-shaped’ enlargement of the pancreas and narrowing of the main pancreatic duct. The presence of raised serum IgG4 is a serological marker. Treatment involves immunosuppressant agents (e.g. corticosteroids or azathioprine). Autoimmune pancreatitis is associated with other autoimmune disorders.

pancreatogram n. a radiographic image of the pancreatic ducts obtained by injecting contrast material into them by direct puncture under ultrasound guidance. It has largely been replaced by noninvasive techniques involving MRCP (see cholangiography).

pancreatotomy n. surgical incision of the pancreatic duct to inspect the duct, to join the duct to the intestine, or to inject contrast material in order to obtain X-ray pictures of the duct system.

pancreozymin n. the name originally given to the fraction of the hormone *cholecystokinin that acts on the pancreas.

pancuronium n. see muscle relaxant.

pancytopenia n. a simultaneous decrease in the numbers of red cells (*anaemia), white cells (*neutropenia), and platelets (*thrombocytopenia) in the blood. It occurs in a variety of disorders, including aplastic *anaemias, *hypersplenism, and tumours of the bone marrow. It may also occur after chemotherapy or total body irradiation.

panda sign a sign of bilateral periorbital *haematoma associated with injury to the anterior cranial fossa, the front of the skull cavity that supports the frontal lobes of the brain. The name derives from its similarity in appearance to the black eye patches of a panda.

pandemic n. an *epidemic so widely spread that vast numbers of people in different countries are affected. For example, a variant of the influenza A virus, H1N1, emerged in North America in 2009 and quickly spread to affect over 200 countries around the globe by August 2010. There was a low level of immunity among the human population, flu vaccines were ineffective, and up to 200,000 people are thought to have died.

panic disorder a condition featuring recurrent episodes of acute distress, mental confusion, and fear of impending death or disaster. The core symptoms of anxiety are often present in an acute panic attack (palpitations, sweating, and tremor). Overbreathing (hyperventilation) often makes the attack worse and can cause tingling in the hands and arms and giddiness. These attacks last ten minutes or less and usually self-terminate; they are especially common in people with *agoraphobia. Treatment is with *antidepressant drugs and *cognitive behavioural therapy. *Anxiety management can also be helpful.

panmixis n. random mating within a population, i.e. when there is no selection of partners on religious, racial, social, or other grounds.

panniculitis n. inflammation of the layer of fat beneath the skin, leading to multiple tender nodules in the legs and trunk. There are many clinical patterns (including *erythema nodosum) and many causes.

panniculus n. a membranous sheet of tissue. For example, the panniculus adiposus is the fatty layer of tissue underlying the skin.

pannus n. vascularized *granulation tissue in the superficial layers of the cornea, growing in from the conjunctiva. It is seen as a result of inflammation of the cornea or conjunctiva, particularly in *trachoma.

panophthalmitis n. inflammation involving the whole of the interior of the eye.

It may cause fatal necrotizing pneumonia or, more commonly, deep skin abscesses that tend to recur frequently. [Sir P. N. Panton (1877–1950) and F. C. Valentine (20th century), British pathologists]

pantoprazole n. see proton-pump inhibitor.

pantothenic acid a B vitamin that is a constituent of *coenzyme A. It plays an important role in the transfer of acetyl groups in the body. Pantothenic acid is widely distributed in food and a deficiency is therefore unlikely to occur.

pantropic adj. describing a virus that can invade and affect many different tissues of the body, for example the nerves, skin, or liver, without showing a special affinity for any one of them.

papain n. a preparation that contains one or more protein-digesting enzymes. It is obtained from the pawpaw fruit and is used as a digestant.

Papanicolaou test (Pap test) see cervical screening. [G. N. Papanicolaou (1883–1962), Greek physician, anatomist, and cytologist]

papaverine n. an alkaloid, derived from opium, that relaxes smooth muscle.

paradoxical breathing breathing movements in which the chest wall moves in on inspiration and out on expiration, in reverse of the normal movements. It may be seen in children with respiratory distress of any cause, which leads to indrawing of the intercostal spaces during inspiration. Patients with chronic airways obstruction also show indrawing of the lower ribs during inspiration, due to the distorted action of a depressed and flattened diaphragm. Crush injuries of the chest, with fractured ribs and sternum, can lead to a severe degree of paradoxical breathing.

paraesthesia n. a spontaneously occurring tingling sensation, sometimes described as pins and needles. It may be due to partial and temporary damage to a peripheral nerve, such as that caused by external pressure on the affected part, but can also result from damage to sensory fibres in the spinal cord or from peripheral vascular disease. Compare dysaesthesia.

paraphimosis n. retraction and constriction of the foreskin behind the glans penis. This occurs in some patients with *phimosis on erection of the penis or in patients who have a urethral catheter in place: the tight foreskin cannot be drawn back over the glans and becomes painful and oedematous. In most cases manual compression, under local or general anaesthesia, allows replacement of the foreskin. Alternatively, a small needle can be used to puncture holes in the oedematous foreskin, followed by gentle but firm pressure allowing reduction of the paraphimosis. *Circumcision may be required to prevent a recurrence.

paraphrenia n. a former name for *late-onset schizophrenia.

parasite n. any living thing that lives in (see endoparasite) or on (see ectoparasite) another living organism (see host). The parasite, which may spend all or only part of its existence with the host, obtains food and/or shelter from the host and contributes nothing to its welfare. Some parasites cause irritation and interfere with bodily functions; others destroy host tissues and release toxins into the body, thus injuring health and causing disease. Human parasites include fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and worms. See also commensal; symbiosis. —parasitic adj.

parasiticide n. an agent that destroys parasites (excluding bacteria and fungi). See also acaricide; anthelmintic; trypanocide.

parathormone n. see parathyroid hormone.

parathyroidectomy n. surgical removal of one or more of the *parathyroid glands, usually as part of the treatment of *hyperparathyroidism.

parathyroid glands two pairs of yellowish-brown *endocrine glands that are situated behind, or sometimes embedded within, the *thyroid gland. They are stimulated to produce *parathyroid hormone by a decrease in the amount of calcium in the blood.

parathyroid hormone (parathormone) a hormone, synthesized and released by the parathyroid glands, that controls the distribution of calcium and phosphate in the body. A high level of the hormone causes transfer of calcium from the bones to the blood; a deficiency lowers blood calcium levels, causing *tetany. This condition may be treated by injections of calcium gluconate. Compare calcitonin.

Recombinant parathyroid hormone (Preotact) is given by subcutaneous injection to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.

parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-RP) a protein that is secreted by certain malignant tumours and is the main cause of malignant *hypercalcaemia. PTH-RP, which has effects similar to *parathyroid hormone, stimulates generalized bone resorption and excessive calcium reabsorption in the kidney tubules. It is most commonly produced by lung tumours, squamous-cell carcinomas of other organs, melanomas, and tumours of the breast, liver, pancreas, bladder, and prostate.

paratyphoid fever an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella paratyphi A, B, or C. Bacteria are spread in the faeces of patients or carriers, and outbreaks occur as a result of poor sanitation or unhygienic food-handling. After an incubation period of 1–10 days, symptoms, including diarrhoea, mild fever, and a pink rash on the chest, appear and last for about a week. Treatment with chloramphenicol is effective. The *TAB vaccine provides temporary immunity against paratyphoid A and B.

pareidolia n. misperception of random stimuli as real things or people, as when faces are vividly seen in the flames of a fire.

parenchyma n. the functional part of an organ, as opposed to the supporting tissue (stroma).

parental order see section 30 order.

parental responsibility the legal status that requires adults to act in the interests of a child’s welfare. A birth mother always has parental responsibility unless it is removed by an adoption order, as has the father if married to the birth mother or named on the birth certificate. Same-sex parents, if civil partners, both have parental responsibility. In medical ethics, a person with parental responsibility can consent to, or refuse, treatment on behalf of a child who is too young to have capacity to make his or her own decisions about health care. However, the entitlement to act on behalf of a child is limited to the extent to which a person with parental responsibility is acting in the child’s best interests. See also Gillick competence.

parkinsonism (akinetic rigid syndrome) n. a clinical picture characterized by tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability. The commonest symptom is tremor, which often affects one hand, spreading first to the leg on the same side and then to the other limbs. It is most pronounced in resting limbs, interfering with such actions as holding a cup. The patient has an expressionless face, an unmodulated voice, an increasing tendency to stoop, and a shuffling walk. Parkinsonism is a disease process affecting the basal ganglia of the brain and associated with a deficiency of the neurotransmitter *dopamine. Sometimes a distinction is made between Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative disorder, and parkinsonism due to other causes. For example, it may be induced by the long-term use of *antipsychotic drugs and uncommonly it can be attributed to the late effects of *encephalitis or coal-gas poisoning, or to *Wilson’s disease, or to multiple strokes (vascular parkinsonism). Other syndromes of which parkinsonism is a feature are *multiple system atrophy and *progressive supranuclear palsy. Relief of the symptoms may be obtained with *antimuscarinic drugs, dopamine-receptor agonists (see dopamine), *levodopa, and subcutaneous *apomorphine injections and infusions. New surgical treatments include stereotactic *pallidotomy and pallidal stimulation. The latter procedure involves placing an electronic stimulator in the globus pallidus that can be controlled by an external switch or control panel. [J. Parkinson (1755–1824), British physician]

parous adj. having given birth to one or more children.

paroxetine n. an antidepressant drug that acts by prolonging the action of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain (see SSRI). It is taken by mouth for the treatment of depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and some other anxiety disorders; side-effects may include nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rash. Because of its short half-life paroxetine is often associated with *discontinuation syndrome upon stopping.

paroxysm n. 1. a sudden violent attack, especially a spasm or convulsion. 2. the abrupt worsening of symptoms or recurrence of disease. —paroxysmal adj.

paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) a type of acquired haemolytic *anaemia that results from an abnormality of the red blood cell membrane. It is due to a defect in the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), whose role is to anchor proteins to the lipid framework of the membrane. This leads to increased *complement-mediated destruction of red blood cells, which results in the release of haemoglobin in the circulation and then in the urine, giving the latter a reddish colour. Some patients may develop blood clots.

PARP inhibitor a drug that blocks the action of the PARP enzyme, which is required for *DNA repair in cancer cells with faulty *BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These drugs are used in the treatment of cancer in patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. They are also undergoing trials to see if they are useful in the treatment of other cancers.

Patau syndrome a chromosome disorder in which there are three no. 13 chromosomes (instead of the usual two), causing abnormal brain development, severe learning disabilities, and defects in the heart, kidney, and scalp. Affected individuals rarely survive. [K. Patau (20th century), US geneticist]

patch test a specialist test to discover which allergen is responsible for contact *dermatitis in a patient. Very low (validated) concentrations of potentially relevant allergens are applied under patches on the back. These are removed after two days and the underlying skin is examined then, and again after a further two days. International criteria exist for interpreting results. A positive test will show an eczematous reaction, although differentiating allergic from irritant reactions is sometimes difficult. The commonest allergens are nickel (e.g. from costume jewellery), fragrances (from toiletries), preservatives, and hair dye chemicals. Establishing the relevance of the reactions is critical.

patella n. the lens-shaped bone that forms the kneecap. It is situated in front of the knee in the tendon of the quadriceps muscle of the thigh. See also sesamoid bone.

patellar reflex (knee jerk) reflex contraction of the quadriceps (thigh) muscle so that the leg kicks, elicited in a patient sitting with one knee crossed over the other by sharply tapping the tendon of the muscle below the kneecap. The reflex is mediated through nerves emanating from the third and fourth lumbar spinal levels (see spinal nerves). This is a test of the connection between the sensory nerves attached to stretch receptors in the muscle, the spinal cord, and the motor neurons running from the cord to the thigh muscle, all of which are involved in the reflex. The patellar reflex is reduced or absent when there is disease or damage of the spinal cord at or below the level of the reflex and exaggerated in disorders above the level of the reflex.

patency n. the relative openness or lack of obstruction in a tube or vessel, such as an artery or Fallopian tube.

It usually causes no symptoms; an isolated patent foramen ovale without any other structural heart defect is usually of no haemodynamic significance.

paternalism n. an attitude or policy that overrides a person’s own wishes (*autonomy) in pursuit of his or her *best interests. The classic argument against paternalism of the philosopher John Stuart Mill is that intervention is justified only when trying to prevent a person from causing harm to others, not to himself. However, a form of paternalism may be justified when a person lacks the capacity to make decisions for him- or herself, assuming there is no valid *advance directive, decision, or statement or a proxy with *power of attorney to represent the patient’s wishes. See also therapeutic privilege. —paternalistic adj.

path- (patho-) combining form denoting disease. Example: pathophobia (morbid fear of).

pathogen n. a microorganism, such as a bacterium, yeast, or virus that parasitizes an animal (or plant) or a human and produces a disease.

pathogenic adj. capable of causing disease. The term is applied to a parasitic microorganism (especially a bacterium) in relation to its host. —pathogenicity n.

pathognomonic adj. describing a symptom or sign that is characteristic of or unique to a particular disease. The presence of such a sign or symptom allows positive diagnosis of the disease.

pathological adj. relating to or arising from disease.

pathological fracture a fracture through diseased or abnormal bone, usually resulting from a force insufficient to fracture a normal bone. Tumour, infection, congenital bone defects, and osteoporosis are among the causes.

pathology n. the study of disease processes with the aim of understanding their nature and causes. This is achieved by observing samples of blood, urine, faeces, and diseased tissue obtained from the living patient or at autopsy, by the use of X-rays, and by many other techniques. (See biopsy.) Clinical pathology is the application of the knowledge gained to the treatment of patients. —pathologist n.

-pathy combining form denoting 1. disease. Examples: nephropathy (of the kidney); neuropathy (of nerves). 2. therapy. Example: osteopathy (by manipulation).

Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) (in England) a confidential service provided by each NHS trust to support patients, their families, and carers by giving advice and information in response to questions and concerns about local NHS services. See also advocacy.

patulous adj. open or distended. A patulous Eustachian tube is abnormally open. Air passing the nasal end of the tube sucks air from the middle ear. This creates symptoms including a flapping sensation, *autophony, and a paradoxical sensation that the ear is blocked.

pauciarthritis n. see arthritis.

pavementation (pavementing) n. the sticking of white blood cells to the linings of the finest blood vessels (capillaries) when inflammation occurs.

PCA3 a gene that is expressed (i.e. manifests its effects) 60–100 times more in cancerous prostate tissue than in benign prostate tissue. A test for PCA3 can be performed on urine passed just after a digital rectal examination of the prostate; uPM3 – the first such test to be developed – is a far more specific indicator of the presence of prostate cancer than tests for *prostate specific antigen (PSA), increased amounts of which are produced in both malignant and nonmalignant prostate tissue. However, the test is not as sensitive as PSA in detecting the presence of prostate cancer.

PCI see percutaneous coronary intervention.

PCNL see percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

PCO see polycystic ovary.

PCOS see polycystic ovary syndrome.

PCP Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia. Although the causative organism has been reclassified and renamed, the original abbreviation continues to be used for this type of pneumonia. See Pneumocystis.

PCR see polymerase chain reaction.

PDGF platelet-derived growth factor (see growth factor).

peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) the maximum rate at which a person can forcibly expel air from the lungs at any time, expressed usually in litres per minute (occasionally in litres per second). A low value can help diagnose asthma in the correct clinical context, and differences between the morning and evening values can also be a feature of poor control of asthma. There is a place for PEFR in the monitoring of acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) but not in the diagnosis of COPD.

peau d’orange a dimpled appearance of the skin over a breast tumour, resembling the surface of an orange. The skin is thickened and the openings of hair follicles and sweat glands are enlarged.

pecten n. 1. the middle section of the anal canal, below the anal valves (see anus). 2. a sharp ridge on the upper branch of the pubis (part of the hip bone). —pectineal adj.

pectoral adj. relating to the chest.

pectoral girdle see shoulder girdle.

pectoral muscles the chest muscles (see illustration). The pectoralis major is a large fan-shaped muscle that works over the shoulder joint, drawing the arm forward across the chest and rotating it medially. Beneath it, the pectoralis minor depresses the shoulder and draws the scapula down towards the chest.

Pectoral muscles.





pectoriloquy n. abnormal transmission of the patient’s voice sounds through the chest wall so that they can be clearly heard through a stethoscope. Whispered sounds (whispering pectoriloquy) can be heard over the lung of a patient with pneumonia.

pectus n. the chest or breast.

pectus carinatum see pigeon chest.

pectus excavatum see funnel chest.

pedicle n. 1. the narrow neck of tissue connecting some tumours to the normal tissue from which they have developed. 2. (in plastic surgery) a narrow folded tube of skin by means of which a piece of skin used for grafting remains attached to its original site. A pedicle graft is used when the recipient site is unsuited to take an independent skin graft (for example, because of poor blood supply). See also flap; skin graft. 3. (in anatomy) any slender stemlike process.

pediculicide n. an agent that kills lice; examples include *dimeticone, *malathion, and *permethrin.

Pediculoides (Pyemotes) n. a genus of widely distributed tiny predaceous mites. P. ventricosus occasionally attacks humans and causes an allergic dermatitis called grain itch. This complaint most usually affects those people coming into contact with stored cereal products, such as hay and grain.

pediculosis n. an infestation with lice, which causes intense itching; continued scratching by the patient may result in secondary bacterial infection of the skin. Head lice (pediculosis capitis; see Pediculus) are quite common in schoolchildren and do not indicate poor hygiene; they may be treated with *malathion or other pediculicide lotions and/or by the use of a fine-toothed nit comb. By contrast, body lice (pediculosis corporis) often affect the homeless and others without access to washing facilities. Pubic (or crab) lice (*Phthirus pubis) are commonly sexually transmitted and respond to the same treatment as head lice.

Pediculus n. a widely distributed genus of lice. There are two varieties of the species affecting humans: P. humanus capitis, the head louse; and P. humanus corporis, the body louse. The presence of these parasites can irritate the skin (see pediculosis), and in some parts of the world body lice are involved in transmitting *relapsing fever and *typhus.

pedometer n. a small portable device that records the number of paces walked, and thus the approximate distance covered. A pedometer is usually attached to the leg or hung at the belt.

peduncle n. a narrow process or stalklike structure, serving as a support or a connection. For example, the middle cerebellar peduncle connects the pons and cerebellum.

peg lateral (peg tooth) an upper lateral incisor that is abnormally small. This is a common form of *microdontia.

pegvisomant n. see growth hormone.

pellagra n. a nutritional disease due to a deficiency of *nicotinic acid (a B vitamin). Pellagra results from the consumption of a diet that is poor in either nicotinic acid or the amino acid tryptophan, from which nicotinic acid can be synthesized in the body. It is common in maize-eating communities. The symptoms of pellagra are scaly dermatitis on exposed surfaces, diarrhoea, and depression.

pellicle n. a thin layer of skin, membrane, or any other substance.

pelvic-floor muscle training see Kegel exercises.

pelvic girdle (hip girdle) the bony structure to which the bones of the lower limbs are attached. It consists of the right and left *hip bones.

pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) an acute or chronic condition in which the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries are infected. It is usually the result of infection ascending from the vagina; *Chlamydia trachomatis and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been identified as causative agents. PID may be associated with lower abdominal pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, and vaginal discharge. An acute infection may respond to treatment with antibiotics, but in the chronic state, when pelvic *adhesions have developed, surgical removal of the diseased tissue may be necessary. Blocking of the Fallopian tubes is a common result of pelvic inflammatory disease; this can lead to *ectopic pregnancy or infertility.

pelvimetry n. measurement of the four internal diameters of the pelvis (transverse, anteroposterior, left oblique, and right oblique) on an X-ray image or by means of CT or MR scanning. Pelvimetry may be used to determine if a vaginal delivery will be possible, but it is an unreliable predictor of obstetric outcome and its use is outmoded. Clinical pelvimetry is a means of assessing pelvic capacity through a vaginal examination; it is subjective and its results must be used with caution.

pelvis n. (pl. pelves) 1. the bony structure formed by the *hip bones, *sacrum, and *coccyx: the bony pelvis (see illustration overleaf). The hip bones are fused at the back to the sacrum to form a rigid structure that protects the organs of the lower abdomen and provides attachment for the bones and muscles of the lower limbs. The female pelvis may be one of four shapes (see illustration overleaf). In the android pelvis the cavity is funnel-shaped with a contracted outlet; the anthropoid pelvis is long, narrow, and oval. The classical shape, gynaecoid, has a transversely oval outlet and a roomy pelvic cavity; the platypelloid pelvis is wide and flattened at the brim, with the promontory of the sacrum pushed forward. 2. the lower part of the abdomen. 3. the cavity within the bony pelvis. 4. any structure shaped like a basin, e.g. the expanded part of the ureter in the kidney (renal pelvis). —pelvic adj.

The male pelvis (ventral view).





The female pelvis.

pemphigoid (bullous pemphigoid) n. a chronic itchy blistering disorder most common in the elderly. The blisters most commonly occur on the limbs and may persist, unlike those of *pemphigus. Pemphigoid is an *autoimmune disease and responds to treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs. Ocular pemphigoid is a potentially blinding disease in which there is dryness, blistering, and scarring of the conjunctiva, leading to shortening of the *fornices due to adhesions (*symblepharon).

pemphigoid gestationalis (pemphigoid gestationis) a rare autoimmune condition (1 in 10,000–1 in 60,000 pregnancies) that usually starts in the second trimester with itching preceding a widespread *polymorphic eruption with vesicles and blisters. It is associated with *intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery.

pemphigus (pemphigus vulgaris) n. a rare but serious type of *autoimmune disease marked by successive outbreaks of blisters. The blisters are superficial and do not remain intact for long; the mouth and other mucous membranes, as well as the skin, are usually affected. Oral pemphigus often precedes skin lesions; it is more prevalent in women and without treatment is potentially fatal. A number of milder variants of the disease exist. Systemic immunosuppressant treatment is required.

Pena operation a recommended surgical treatment of congenital anal malformation.

Pendred’s syndrome goitre associated with congenital deafness due to deficiency of *peroxidase, an enzyme that is essential for the utilization of iodine. [V. Pendred (1869–1946), British physician]

penectomy n. surgical removal of the penis, most commonly performed for penile cancer. It may be partial or total, depending on the degree of local tumour invasion.

penetrance n. the frequency with which the characteristic controlled by a gene is seen in the individuals possessing it. Complete penetrance occurs when the characteristic is seen in all individuals known to possess the gene. If a percentage of individuals with the gene do not show its effects, penetrance is incomplete. In this way a characteristic in a family may appear to ‘skip’ a generation.

-penia combining form denoting lack or deficiency. Example: neutropenia (of neutrophils).

penicillamine n. a drug that binds metals and therefore aids their excretion (see chelating agent). It is used to treat *Wilson’s disease and severe rheumatoid arthritis (see disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). It may cause blood disorders (blood counts should be carried out during treatment); other side-effects include nausea, loss of taste, and rashes.

penicillin n. an *antibiotic that was derived from the mould Penicillium rubrum and first became available for treating bacterial infections in 1941. Since then, a number of naturally occurring penicillins have been developed to treat a wide variety of infections, notably benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). There are few serious side-effects, but some patients are allergic to penicillin and develop such reactions as skin rashes and potentially fatal *anaphylaxis. Many antibiotics are derived from the penicillins, including *amoxicillin, *ampicillin, and *ticarcillin; these are known as semisynthetic penicillins. All penicillins except *flucloxacillin are *beta-lactam antibiotics and are sensitive to penicillinase.

penicillinase n. an enzyme, produced by some bacteria, that is capable of antagonizing the antibacterial action of penicillin and other *beta-lactam antibiotics. Purified penicillinase may be used to treat reactions to penicillin. It is also used in diagnostic tests to isolate microorganisms from the blood of patients receiving penicillin.

Penicillium n. a genus of mouldlike fungi that commonly grow on decaying fruit, bread, or cheese. The species P. rubrum is the major natural source of the antibiotic *penicillin. Some species of Penicillium are pathogenic to humans, causing diseases of the skin and respiratory tract.

penile fracture the traumatic rupture of the *tunica albuginea of the erect penis (the fibrous covering of the spongy tissue of the penis).

penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) cellular changes affecting the glans, prepuce, or penile shaft that precede the invasive stages of cancer of the penis. There are three stages (PIN I, II, or III) based on the degree of *dysplasia. The pathological features of PIN III indicate *carcinoma in situ, known as *erythroplasia of Queyrat and Bowen’s disease.

penile pearly papules pale or skin-coloured papules that cluster around the corona of the glans penis in young uncircumcised men. They are asymptomatic but may be mistaken for viral warts.

penile prosthesis see prosthesis.

penis n. the male organ that carries the *urethra, through which urine and semen are discharged (see illustration). Most of the organ is composed of erectile tissue (see corpus cavernosum; corpus spongiosum), which becomes filled with blood under conditions of sexual excitement, causing an erection. The erect penis can enter the vagina and ejaculate semen. See also glans; prepuce.

The penis (median section).





pent- (penta-) combining form denoting five.

pentamidine n. a drug effective against protozoans and used in the treatment of *Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients, *leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis.

peppermint oil an *antispasmodic that relieves pain and distension in irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease.

pepsin n. an enzyme in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins by splitting them into peptones (see peptidase). It is produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on pepsinogen, which is secreted by the gastric glands. Once made, pepsin itself can act on pepsinogen to produce more pepsin.

pepsinogen n. see pepsin.

peptic adj. 1. relating to pepsin. 2. relating to digestion.

peptic ulcer a breach in the lining (mucosa) of the digestive tract caused by the actions of gastric acid and pepsin. This may occur due to abnormally high levels of gastric acid or pepsin or when the mucosa has been damaged by chronic *Helicobacter pylori infection or by aspirin or NSAID use. A peptic ulcer may be found in the oesophagus (oesophageal ulcer, associated with reflux *oesophagitis); the stomach (see gastric ulcer); duodenum (see duodenal ulcer); jejunum (jejunal ulcer, usually in the *Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); in a Meckel’s *diverticulum; and close to a *gastroenterostomy (stomal ulcer, anastomotic ulcer, marginal ulcer).

peptidase n. one of a group of digestive enzymes that split proteins in the stomach and intestine into their constituent amino acids. The group is divided into the *endopeptidases and *exopeptidases.

peptide n. a molecule consisting of two or more *amino acids linked by bonds between the amino group (−NH) and the carboxyl group (−CO). This bond is known as a peptide bond. See also polypeptide.

peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) a type of radiotherapy used to treat neuroendocrine tumours (NETs; see neuroendocrine system). A *radionuclide is combined with a relevant *peptide to create a so-called radiopeptide, which is injected into the patient’s bloodstream. Because NETs have an overexpression of peptide receptors, the radiopeptide binds to the tumour, delivering a high dose of radiation directly to the cancer cells. The chief merit of PRRT is this ability to target delivery of radionuclides for highly localized treatment. A similar technique, using a gamma emitter as the radionuclide, can be used for locating and imaging NETs.

peptone n. a large protein fragment produced by the action of enzymes on proteins in the first stages of protein digestion.

peptonuria n. the presence in the urine of *peptones, intermediate compounds formed during the digestion of proteins.

perception n. the process by which information about the world, as received by the senses, is analysed and made meaningful. Abnormalities of perception include *hallucinations, *illusions, and *agnosia.

percussion n. the technique of examining part of the body by tapping it with the fingers or an instrument (plessor) and sensing the resultant vibrations. With experience it is possible to detect the presence of abnormal solidification or enlargement in different organs and the presence of fluid, for example in the lungs.

percutaneous adj. through the skin: often applied to the route of administration of drugs in ointments, etc., which are absorbed through the skin.

percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment of coronary artery disease delivered by cardiac *catheterization. This usually means *coronary angioplasty followed by insertion of a coronary *stent, but also includes more specialized procedures, such as rotational *atherectomy (rotablation). Primary PCI refers to the use of PCI as the first-line treatment to relieve coronary obstruction in S-T elevation *myocardial infarction, rather than *thrombolysis. Rescue PCI is used in the event of unsuccessful thrombolysis.

percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration see PESA.

percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) a technique of removing stones from the kidney via a *nephroscope passed into the kidney through a dilated track established from the skin surface into the renal pelvis.

percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography imaging of the bile duct and pancreatic duct. A catheter is carefully manipulated into the ducts via direct puncture through the abdomen under radiological guidance. Contrast material is flushed through the catheter to delineate the ducts (see also cholangiography). This procedure is often performed in cases of obstructive jaundice prior to insertion of a biliary drain or stent when *ERCP is not possible.

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) dilatation of a narrowed coronary artery using a balloon catheter advanced to the heart through a peripheral artery. It is now more commonly referred to as *percutaneous coronary intervention to take into account the fact that a coronary *stent is nearly always also deployed. See angioplasty.

perforation n. the formation of a hole in a hollow organ. This may occur in the course of a disease (e.g. perforation from a *duodenal ulcer, or stomach cancer), allowing the flow of intestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity, with subsequent inflammation (*peritonitis), severe abdominal pain, and shock. Treatment is usually by surgical repair of the perforation, but conservative treatment with antibiotics may result in spontaneous healing. Perforations may also be caused by instruments – for example a gastroscope may perforate the stomach or a curette may perforate the uterus – or by injury, for example to the eardrum.

performance status a scoring system used to quantify a patient’s activity level and general wellbeing in order to assess the patient’s suitability for chemotherapy or for taking part in a clinical trial. Commonly used systems include the WHO performance scale, scoring from 0 (fully active, feeling well) to 4 or 5 (very ill or near to death), and the Karnofsky scale, scoring from 0 (very ill) to 100 (feeling well).

perforin n. a protein produced by *cytotoxic T cells and *natural killer cells that are in contact with virus-infected target cells. It creates pores in the target-cell membrane, which facilitates the delivery of *granzymes to the cell to induce cell death (*apoptosis).

perfusion n. 1. the passage of fluid through a tissue, especially the passage of blood through the lung tissue to pick up oxygen from the air in the alveoli, which is brought there by *ventilation, and release carbon dioxide. If ventilation is impaired deoxygenated venous blood is returned to the general circulation. If perfusion is impaired insufficient gas exchange takes place. 2. the deliberate introduction of fluid into a tissue, usually by injection into the blood vessels supplying the tissue.

perfusion scan a technique for demonstrating an abnormal blood supply to an organ by injecting a radioactive *tracer or *contrast medium. One of the most common uses, often in conjunction with ventilation scanning (see ventilation-perfusion scanning), is to detect obstruction of pulmonary arteries due to embolism by thrombus (see pulmonary embolism). Particles labelled with radioactive tracer are injected intravenously and become temporarily lodged in the capillaries in the lungs. Areas not being perfused show up as holes on the gamma-camera images. In *magnetic resonance imaging or *computerized tomography, contrast medium is injected and a series of images is obtained. The rate of change of enhancement is an index of the blood supply to the area of interest. This technique can be used to study blood supply to the brain, heart, or kidneys (in particular), to help diagnose arterial strictures or blockages, or tumours in which blood supply may be increased by abnormal vessels.

pergolide n. a drug that stimulates *dopamine receptors in the brain and is now rarely used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Possible side-effects include confusion, hallucinations, sleepiness, heart irregularity, nausea, breathing difficulties, and double vision (see also bromocriptine).

peri- prefix denoting near, around, or enclosing. Examples: perianal (around the anus); pericardial (around the heart); peritonsillar (around a tonsil).

periadenitis n. inflammation of tissues surrounding a gland.

perianal haematoma (external haemorrhoid) a painful swelling composed of blood that lies next to the anus. Typically it develops following an episode of straining during defecation or protracted coughing. Perianal haematomas are caused by the rupture of a small vein in the anus. They often heal spontaneously but occasionally rupture. Rarely this is followed by abscess formation. If severe pain continues, surgical removal may be undertaken. See also haemorrhoids.

periapical adj. around an apex, particularly the apex of a tooth. The term is applied to bone surrounding the apex and to X-ray views of this area.

peri-arrest period the recognized period, either just before or just after a full *cardiac arrest, when the patient’s condition is very unstable and care must be taken to prevent progression or regression into a full cardiac arrest.

periarteritis nodosa see polyarteritis nodosa.

periarthritis n. inflammation of tissues around a joint capsule, including tendons and *bursae. Chronic periarthritis, which may be spontaneous or follow injury, is a common cause of pain and stiffness of the shoulder; it usually responds to local steroid injections or physiotherapy.

periarticular adj. around a joint, including the joint margins and surrounding area immediately adjacent to the joint capsule. The term is commonly used to specify fractures, tumours, and types of internal fixation devices. See also extra-articular; intra-articular.

peribulbar adj. (in ophthalmology) denoting the area around the eyeball.

pericard- (pericardio-) combining form denoting the pericardium.

pericardiectomy (pericardectomy) n. surgical removal of the membranous sac surrounding the heart (pericardium). It is used in the treatment of chronic constrictive pericarditis and chronic pericardial effusion (see pericarditis).

pericardiotomy (pericardotomy) n. surgical opening or puncture of the membranous sac (pericardium) around the heart. It is required to gain access to the heart in heart surgery and to remove excess fluid from within the pericardium.

pericarditis n. acute or chronic inflammation of the membranous sac (pericardium) surrounding the heart. Pericarditis may be seen alone or as part of pancarditis (see endomyocarditis). It has numerous causes, including virus infections, uraemia, and cancer. Acute pericarditis is characterized by fever, chest pain, and a pericardial friction rub (a harsh scratching noise audible over the anterior chest wall with the aid of a stethoscope). Fluid may accumulate within the pericardial sac (pericardial effusion). Rarely, chronic thickening of the pericardium (chronic constrictive pericarditis) develops. This interferes with activity of the heart and has many features in common with *heart failure, including oedema, pleural effusions, ascites, and engorgement of the veins. Constrictive pericarditis most often results from tubercular infection.

The treatment of pericarditis is directed to the cause. Pericardial effusions may be aspirated by a needle inserted through the chest wall. Chronic constrictive pericarditis is treated by surgical removal of the pericardium (pericardiectomy).

pericardium n. the membrane surrounding the heart, consisting of two portions. The outer fibrous pericardium completely encloses the heart and is attached to the large blood vessels emerging from the heart. The internal serous pericardium is a closed sac of *serous membrane: the inner visceral portion (epicardium) is closely attached to the muscular heart wall and the outer parietal portion lines the fibrous pericardium. Within the sac is a very small amount of fluid, which prevents friction as the two surfaces slide over one another as the heart beats. —pericardial adj.

pericardotomy n. see pericardiotomy.

perichondritis n. inflammation of cartilage and surrounding soft tissues, usually due to chronic infection. A common site is the external ear.

perichondrium n. the dense layer of fibrous connective tissue that covers the surface of *cartilage.

pericoronitis n. inflammation of the gingivae around the crown of a tooth, particularly a partially erupted third molar.

pericranium n. the *periosteum of the skull.

pericystitis n. inflammation in the tissues around the bladder, causing pain in the pelvis, fever, and symptoms of *cystitis. It usually results from infection in the Fallopian tubes or uterus, but can occasionally arise from severe infection in a *diverticulum of the bladder itself. Treatment of pericystitis is directed to the underlying cause and usually involves antibiotic therapy. Pericystitis associated with a pelvic abscess clears when the abscess is surgically drained.

periderm n. see epitrichium.

perihepatitis n. inflammation of the membrane covering the liver (capsule). It is usually associated with abnormalities of the liver (including liver abscess, cirrhosis, tuberculosis) or chronic peritonitis.

perikaryon n. see cell body.

perilymph n. the fluid between the bony and membranous *labyrinths of the ear.

perimenopause n. the period of time around the *menopause in which marked changes in the menstrual cycle occur, usually accompanied by hot flushes, and in which no 12 consecutive months of *amenorrhoea have yet occurred.

perimeter n. an instrument for mapping the extent of the *visual field. The patient fixes his or her gaze on a target in the centre of the inner surface of the hemisphere. Objects are presented on this surface and the patient says if they can be seen. The area of the visual field can be defined and any gaps in the field can be detected. There are several types of perimeter. In the static perimeter the movable object is replaced by a system of tiny lights that can be flashed briefly. A patient with a field defect will fail to see the lights that flash in the area of the defect. Modern visual field testing uses computer-assisted automated perimeters to map out and analyse visual fields and thus detect very subtle field defects (computerized perimetry). Automated perimeters are commonly used in the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma. —perimetry n.

perimetritis n. inflammation of the membrane on the outer surface of the uterus. The condition may be associated with *parametritis.

perimetrium n. the *peritoneum of the uterus.

perimysium n. the fibrous sheath that surrounds each bundle of *muscle fibres.

perinatal adj. relating to the period starting a few weeks before birth and including the birth and a few weeks after birth.

See infant mortality rate. See also confidential enquiries.

perineal descent abnormal bulging down of the *perineum as a result of weakness of the pelvic floor muscles. It often accompanies problems with defecation and micturition.

perineal repair see perineorrhaphy.

perineal tear (perineal trauma) an injury to the perineum, which may be sustained during childbirth. Perineal tears can be classified by degree. First-degree tears involve the perineal skin and vaginal mucosa only. Second-degree tears involve the perineal muscles but not the anal sphincter. Third-degree tears involve the anal sphincter complex: the external anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter (IAS). These are subclassified as 3a (less than 50% of EAS thickness torn), 3b (more than 50% of EAS thickness torn), and 3c (IAS torn). Fourth-degree tears involve the anal sphincter complex (EAS and IAS) and the anal epithelium or rectal mucosa. It is vitally important that these injuries are recognized and repaired by competent personnel. See also obstetric anal sphincter injury.

perineoplasty n. an operation designed to enlarge the vaginal opening by incising the hymen and part of the perineum (Fenton’s operation).

perineorrhaphy n. the surgical repair of a damaged perineum. The damage is usually the result of a tear in the perineum sustained during childbirth (see perineal tear).

perinephric abscess a collection of pus around the kidney, usually secondary to *pyonephrosis but also resulting from spread of infection from other sites. It is more likely to occur in individuals who are immunosuppressed or have diabetes mellitus. Percutaneous or open surgical drainage are usually necessary but occasionally nephrectomy may be needed if the kidney is severely infected.

perinephritis n. inflammation of the tissues around the kidney. This is usually due to spread of infection from the kidney itself (see pyelonephritis; pyonephrosis). The patient has pain in the loins, fever, and fits of shivering. Prompt treatment of the underlying renal infection is required to prevent progression to an abscess.

perineum n. the region of the body between the anus and the urethral opening, including both skin and underlying muscle. In females it is perforated by the vaginal opening. —perineal adj.

perineurium n. the sheath of connective tissue that surrounds individual bundles (fascicles) of nerve fibres within a large *nerve.

periocular adj. adjacent to the eyeball.

periodic acid–Schiff reaction (PAS reaction) a test for the presence of glycoproteins, polysaccharides, certain mucopolysaccharides, glycolipids, and certain fatty acids in tissue sections. The tissue is treated with periodic acid, followed by *Schiff’s reagent. A positive reaction is the development of a red or magenta coloration.

periodic fever see malaria.

periodontal adj. denoting or relating to the gums and other tissues surrounding and supporting the teeth.

periodontal abscess a localized abscess that arises in the periodontal tissues and is usually an acute manifestation of periodontal disease. It appears as a pocket of pus in the tissues of the gum but not around the apex of the tooth.

periodontal disease a disease of the tissues that support and attach the teeth – the gums, periodontal membrane, and alveolar bone. It is caused by the metabolism of bacterial *plaque on the surfaces of the teeth adjacent to these tissues. Periodontal disease includes *gingivitis and the more advanced stage of periodontitis, which results in the formation of spaces between the gums and the teeth (periodontal pockets), the loss of some fibres that attach the tooth to the jaw, and the loss of bone. The disease is widespread and is the most common cause of tooth loss in older people. Poor oral hygiene is a major contributory factor, but the resistance of the patient also has some influence; for example, the reduced resistance of patients with AIDS may predispose to periodontal disease.

periodontal membrane (periodontal ligament) the ligament around a *tooth, by which it is attached to the bone.

periodontal pocket a space between the gingival tissues and tooth occurring in periodontitis. See periodontal disease.

periodontium n. the tissues that support and attach the teeth to the jaw: the gums (see gingiva), *periodontal membrane, alveolar bone, and *cementum.

periodontology n. the branch of dentistry concerned with the tissues that support and attach the teeth and the prevention and treatment of *periodontal disease.

perioperative adj. denoting the period that extends from the day before to the first few days after surgery, during which drugs (e.g. analgesics, antibiotics, anticoagulants) may need to be administered and *vital signs are monitored.

periorbital adj. 1. around the eye socket (*orbit). 2. relating to the periosteum within the orbit.

periosteum n. a layer of dense connective tissue that covers the surface of a bone except at the articular surfaces. The outer layer of the periosteum is extremely dense and contains a large number of blood vessels. The inner layer is more cellular in appearance and contains osteoblasts and fewer blood vessels. The periosteum provides attachment for muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

periostitis n. inflammation of the membrane surrounding a bone (see periosteum). Acute periostitis results from direct injury to the bone and is associated with a *haematoma, which may later become infected. The uncomplicated condition subsides quickly with rest and anti-inflammatory analgesics. Chronic periostitis sometimes follows but is more often due to an inflammatory disease, such as tuberculosis or syphilis, or to a chronic ulcer overlying the bone involved. Chronic periostitis causes thickening of the underlying bone, which is evident on X-ray.

periotome n. a sharp instrument used in dental extractions. It is used to sever the periodontal ligament, thereby enabling an atraumatic extraction with minimal damage to the bony and soft tissue architecture.

peripheral nervous system all parts of the nervous system lying outside the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It includes the *cranial nerves and *spinal nerves and their branches, which link the receptors and effector organs with the brain and spinal cord. See also autonomic nervous system.

peripheral neuropathy (polyneuropathy, peripheral neuritis) any of a group of disorders affecting the sensory and/or motor nerves in the peripheral nervous system. They tend to start distally, in the fingers and toes, and progress proximally. Symptoms include pins and needles, stabbing pains and a numbness on the sensory side, and weakness of the muscles. The most common causes of peripheral neuropathy are diabetes, alcohol, certain drugs, and such infections as HIV; genetic causes of peripheral neuropathy include amyloidosis and *Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The diagnosis may be established by neurophysiological tests, blood tests, and occasionally a nerve biopsy.

peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) the delivery of nutrients directly into a peripheral vein (in the arm). Feed solutions must have a low *osmolality (<1200 mOsm/l), and PPN can be given only for a short period (less than four weeks). There is a risk of *phlebitis. See artificial nutrition and hydration; total parenteral nutrition.

periphlebitis n. inflammation of the tissues around a vein: seen as an extension of *phlebitis.

perisalpingitis n. inflammation of the peritoneal membrane on the outer surface of a Fallopian tube.

perisplenitis n. inflammation of the external coverings of the spleen.

peristalsis n. a wavelike movement that progresses along some of the hollow tubes of the body. It occurs involuntarily and is characteristic of tubes that possess circular and longitudinal muscles, such as the *intestines. It is induced by distension of the walls of the tube. Immediately behind the distension the circular muscle contracts. In front of the distension the circular muscle relaxes and the longitudinal muscle contracts, which pushes the contents of the tube forward. —peristaltic adj.

peritendineum n. the fibrous covering of a tendon.

peritendinitis n. see tenosynovitis.

peritomy n. an eye operation in which an incision of the conjunctiva is made in a complete circle around the cornea.

peritoneal dialysis (PD) a form of renal replacement therapy (see dialysis) that utilizes the peritoneum as the semipermeable membrane separating blood and *dialysate. Peritoneal dialysis can be given as a temporary and emergency treatment using a rigid percutaneous cannula to deliver fluid into the peritoneal cavity; this cannula usually needs removal and/or replacement within a few days. Alternatively, PD can be used as a chronic treatment, either in the form of chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (see CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), in which case fluid delivery is through a soft silastic catheter that is tunnelled subcutaneously out of the peritoneal cavity and is designed to stay in place for years. In all cases, the dialysis fluid is left within the peritoneal cavity for a period of time during which substances in the bloodstream diffuse into the fluid according to their concentration gradient and the permeability of the peritoneal membrane.

peritoneoscope n. see laparoscope.

peritoneum n. the *serous membrane of the abdominal cavity (see illustration). The parietal peritoneum lines the walls of the abdomen, and the visceral peritoneum covers the abdominal organs. See also mesentery; omentum. —peritoneal adj.

Peritoneum. Sagittal section of the abdomen to show arrangement of the peritoneum.





peritonitis n. inflammation of the *peritoneum. Primary peritonitis is caused by bacteria spread via the bloodstream: examples are pneumococcal peritonitis and tuberculous peritonitis. Symptoms are diffuse abdominal pain and swelling, with fever and weight loss. Fluid may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity (see ascites) or the infection may complicate existing ascites (see spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). Secondary peritonitis is due to perforation or rupture of an abdominal organ (for example, a duodenal ulcer, the gall bladder, or the vermiform appendix), allowing access of bacteria and irritant digestive juices to the peritoneum. This produces sudden severe abdominal pain, first at the site of rupture but later becoming generalized. Shock develops, and the abdominal wall becomes rigid; X-ray examination may reveal gas within the peritoneal cavity. Treatment is usually by surgical repair of the perforation, but in some cases conservative treatment using antibiotics and intravenous fluid may be used. *Subphrenic abscess is a possible complication. Meconium peritonitis occurs in newborn infants as a result of a perforated intestine; it is initially a sterile contamination of the peritoneum.

peritonsillar abscess see quinsy.

peritrichous adj. describing bacteria in which the flagella cover the entire cell surface.

perityphlitis n. Archaic. inflammation of the tissues around the caecum.

Treatment is directed to relieving any obstruction of the ureter and controlling the infection with antibiotics.

periurethral injection the injection of a bulking agent (e.g. collagen) into the tissues around the urethra, used for the treatment of urodynamic stress *incontinence. Such injections have a low morbidity and are easy to administer, and results are better in women with good bladder-neck support but poor urethral function. The short-term success rates of these procedures are reasonable, but long-term success rates are poor.

perivascular spaces see Virchow–Robin spaces.

periventricular haemorrhage (PVH) a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants who are born prematurely in which bleeding occurs from fragile blood vessels around the *ventricles in the brain. Bleeding extending into the lateral ventricles is termed intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and in severe cases can extend into the brain tissue (cerebral parenchyma). Surviving infants may have long-term neurological deficits, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delay, or seizures.

periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) softening of white matter around the ventricles of the brain in preterm infants due to a decreased blood supply to the brain, usually associated with *hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy.

pernicious adj. describing diseases that are highly dangerous or likely to result in death if untreated. See also pernicious anaemia.

pernicious anaemia a form of *anaemia resulting from deficiency of *vitamin B12. This is due either to the failure of the body to produce the substance (*intrinsic factor) that facilitates absorption of B12 from the bowel or to dietary deficiency of the vitamin. Pernicious anaemia is characterized by defective production of red blood cells and the presence of *megaloblasts in the bone marrow. In severe forms the nervous system is affected (see subacute combined degeneration of the cord). The condition is treated by injections of vitamin B12.

persistent vegetative state (PVS) the condition that may be diagnosed after a patient has been in the *vegetative state for more than 4 weeks and is normally regarded as permanent, with little or no hope of recovery, after 12 months. Following the high-profile case of Tony Bland, who was in PVS following injuries sustained in the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster, the law currently allows medical treatment, such as *artificial nutrition and hydration, to be withdrawn from patients in a permanent vegetative state, but permission must first be granted by the courts.

personal independence payment (PIP) a tax-free benefit replacing (from April 2013) *disability living allowance (DLA) for people aged 16–64 (DLA is still paid to children). It has two components – a daily living component (including help with washing, dressing, using the toilet, preparing and eating food, and taking medicines) and a mobility component (for help with walking).

personality n. (in psychology) an enduring disposition to act and feel in particular ways that differentiate one individual from another. These patterns of behaviour are sometimes conceptualized as different categories (see personality disorder) and sometimes as different dimensions (see extroversion; neuroticism).

personality disorder a deeply ingrained and maladaptive pattern of behaviour, persisting over many years. It is usually manifest by the time the individual is adolescent. The abnormality of behaviour must be sufficiently severe that it causes suffering, either to the patient or to other people (or to both). Some individuals with such personalities mature into people who are less debilitated by their personality development. Certain types of psychotherapy are of some therapeutic value, but treatment is mostly aimed at mitigating the worst consequences of the personality disorder rather than cure. The International Classification of Diseases differs slightly from the DSM in its terminology and clustering of personality disorders. See antisocial personality disorder; avoidant; emotionally unstable personality disorder; histrionic personality disorder; schizotypal personality disorder.

person-centred care an approach to health care that focuses on the needs of the individual care user, rather than providing a standardized response to their condition. The patient is encouraged to take an active role in discussing a health-care plan that reflects their own needs, circumstances, and values.

personhood n. a philosophical concept designed to determine which individuals have human rights and responsibilities. Personhood may be distinguished by possession of defining characteristics, such as consciousness and rationality, or in terms of relationships with others. Philosophers disagree on whether all humans are, or all nonhuman animals are not, persons, especially when debating the ethics of abortion, euthanasia, and human uses of animals. In law, corporations can be regarded as having personhood, when identifying their rights and responsibilities.

perspiration n. *sweat or the process of sweating. Insensible perspiration is sweat that evaporates immediately from the skin and is therefore not visible; sensible perspiration is visible on the skin in the form of drops.

PET see positron emission tomography.

PET/CT scanning an imaging system that allows a PET scan (see positron emission tomography) and a CT scan (see computerized tomography) to be performed very close together, with minimal movement of the patient between scans. This means that the images produced can be co-registered (see co-registration), giving very accurate anatomical localization (from the CT scan) of areas of increased activity (identified on the PET scan). This is very important for determining the site of disease in order to plan treatment.

petechiae pl. n. small round flat dark-red spots caused by bleeding into the skin or beneath the mucous membrane. Petechiae occur, for example, in the *purpuras.

phanero- combining form denoting visible; apparent.

phantom limb the sensation that an arm or leg, or part of an arm or leg, is still attached to the body after it has been amputated. Pain may seem to come from the amputated part. This may arise because of stimulation of the amputation stump, which contains severed nerves that formerly carried messages from the removed portion, but more usually occurs because the neural representation of the limb is still present in the brain and may become activated.

phantom pregnancy see pseudocyesis.

The enormous growth of knowledge about the human genome, arising from the *Human Genome Project, has revolutionized drug treatment, enabling the precise targeting of drugs against the products of specific mutations causing disease (see targeted agent). In addition, it will be possible to identify those genetic variations that affect how drugs are metabolized in the body and their potential for causing adverse effects. Thus analysis of genetic data from individuals will enable safer and more effective treatment.

pharmacognosy n. the knowledge or study of pharmacologically active principles derived from plants.

pharmacokinetics n. the study of how drugs are handled within the body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. It is concerned with such matters as how drug concentration in the body changes with time, how drugs pass across cell membranes, how often they should be given, what the effect of long-term administration may be, how drugs interact with each other, and how individual variations affect all these things.

pharmacology n. the science of the properties of drugs and their effects on the body. —pharmacological adj.

phenylketonuria n. an inherited defect of protein metabolism (see inborn error of metabolism) causing an excess of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood, which damages the nervous system and leads to severe learning disabilities. Screening of newborn infants by testing a blood sample for phenylalanine (see Guthrie test) enables the condition to be detected soon enough for dietary treatment to prevent any brain damage: the baby’s diet contains proteins from which phenylalanine has been removed. The gene responsible for phenylketonuria is recessive, so that a child is affected only if both parents are carriers of the defective gene.

phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) n. a substance that tastes bitter to some individuals but is tasteless to others. Response to PTC appears to be controlled by a single pair of genes (*alleles): ability to taste PTC is *dominant to the inability to taste it.

phimosis n. narrowing of the opening of the foreskin, which cannot therefore be drawn back over the underlying glans penis. Physiological phimosis is present at birth and is due to congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans. Nearly all cases resolve by puberty. Pathological phimosis is usually caused by BXO (see balanitis) and can predispose to inflammation (see also balanoposthitis), which results in further narrowing. Treatment is by surgical removal of the foreskin (*circumcision).

phleb- (phlebo-) combining form denoting a vein or veins. Example: phlebectopia (abnormal position of).

phlebectomy n. the surgical removal of a vein (or part of a vein), sometimes performed for the treatment of varicose veins in the legs (varicectomy).

A segment of vein becomes painful and tender and the surrounding skin feels hot and appears red. Thrombosis commonly develops (see thrombophlebitis). Treatment consists of elastic support together with drugs, such as NSAIDs, to relieve the inflammation and pain. Anticoagulants are not used (compare phlebothrombosis). Phlebitis may also complicate sepsis (see pylephlebitis) or cancer, especially of the stomach, bronchus, or pancreas. In pancreatic cancer the phlebitis may affect a variety of veins (thrombophlebitis migrans).

phlebography n. see venography.

phlebolith n. a stone-like structure, usually found incidentally on abdominal X-ray, that results from deposition of calcium in a venous blood clot. It appears as a small round white opacity in the pelvic region. It does not produce symptoms and requires no treatment.

phlebosclerosis (venosclerosis) n. a rare degenerative condition, of unknown cause, that affects the leg veins of young men. The vein walls become thickened and feel like cords under the skin. It is not related to arteriosclerosis and needs no treatment.

phlebothrombosis n. obstruction of a vein by a blood clot, without preceding inflammation of its wall. It is most common within the deep veins of the calf of the leg – deep vein thrombosis (DVT) – in contrast to *thrombophlebitis, which affects superficial leg veins. Prolonged immobility, heart failure, pregnancy, injury, and surgery predispose to thrombosis by encouraging sluggish blood flow. Many of these conditions are associated with changes in the clotting factors in the blood that increase the tendency to thrombosis; these changes also occur in some women taking oral contraceptives.

The affected leg may become swollen and tender. The main danger is that the clot may become detached and give rise to *pulmonary embolism. Regular leg exercises help to prevent deep vein thrombosis, and anticoagulant drugs (such as heparin and warfarin) are used in prevention and treatment. Large clots may be removed surgically in the operation of thrombectomy to relieve leg swelling.

Phlebotomus n. see sandfly.

phlebotomy (venesection) n. the surgical opening or puncture of a vein in order to remove blood (e.g. in the treatment of *polycythaemia) or to infuse fluids, blood, or drugs in the treatment of many conditions.

phlegmon n. Archaic. inflammation of connective tissue, leading to ulceration.

phlycten n. a small pinkish-yellow nodule surrounded by a zone of dilated blood vessels that occurs in the conjunctiva or in the cornea. It develops into a small ulcer that heals without trace in the conjunctiva but produces some residual scarring in the cornea. Phlyctens, which are prone to recur, are thought to be due to a type of allergy to certain bacteria.

phobia n. a pathologically strong *fear of a particular event or thing. Avoiding the feared situation may severely restrict one’s life and cause much suffering. The main kinds of phobia are specific phobias (isolated fears of particular things, such as sharp knives), *agoraphobia, *claustrophobia, social phobias of encountering people, and animal phobias, as of spiders, rats, or dogs (see also preparedness). Treatment is with *cognitive behavioural therapy, *desensitization, *graded self-exposure, or *flooding. Antidepressants are also useful.

Examples of phospholipids are *cephalins, *lecithins, sphingolipids, plasmalogens, and phosphatidylserine.

phosphonecrosis n. the destruction of tissues caused by excessive amounts of phosphorus in the system. The tissues likely to suffer in phosphorus poisoning are the liver, kidneys, muscles, bones, and the cardiovascular system.

phosphorus n. a nonmetallic element. Phosphorus compounds are major constituents in the tissues of both plants and animals. In humans, phosphorus is mostly concentrated in *bone. However, certain phosphorus-containing compounds – for example adenosine triphosphate (*ATP) and *creatine phosphate – play an important part in energy conversions and storage in the body. In a pure state, phosphorus is toxic. Symbol: P.

phosphorylase n. any enzyme that catalyses the combination of an organic molecule (usually glucose) with a phosphate group (phosphorylation). Phosphorylase is found in the liver and kidney, where it is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate.

phot- (photo-) combining form denoting light.

photalgia n. pain in the eye caused by very bright light.

photoablation n. the use of light or lasers to destroy tissue.

photochemotherapy n. see photodynamic therapy; puva.

photocoagulation n. the destruction of tissue by heat released from the absorption of light shone on it. In eye disorders the technique is used to destroy diseased retinal tissue, occurring, for example, as a complication of diabetes (diabetic *retinopathy) and *macular degeneration; and to produce scarring between the retina and choroid, thus binding them together, in cases of *retinal detachment. Photocoagulation of the retina is usually done with an *argon or *diode laser.

Photocoagulation is also a method of arresting bleeding by causing coagulation, usually using an infrared light source.

photodermatosis n. any of various skin diseases caused by exposure to light of varying wavelength (see photosensitivity). The facial prominences and the ‘V’ of the neck are most commonly affected, the shadow areas behind the ears and below the chin being protected. A common photodermatosis is polymorphous light eruption, which affects 10% of the population. It appears with the first sunshine of spring and abates by late summer. The photodermatoses include certain *porphyrias, notably porphyria cutanea tarda.

photodynamic diagnosis a technique for improving the sensitivity and specificity of bladder cancer diagnosis at cystoscopy using a light-sensitive agent. This agent is instilled into the bladder, taken up by the epithelial cells, and converted into a porphyrin that accumulates only in malignant and premalignant cells. It fluoresces under light of a specific wavelength and is thus highlighted against normal bladder mucosa.

photodynamic therapy (PDT, photoradiation therapy, phototherapy, photochemotherapy) 1. a treatment for some types of superficial cancers. A light-sensitive agent (porfimer sodium [Photofrin] or temoporfin [Foscan]) is injected into the bloodstream and remains in cancer cells for a longer time than in normal cells. Exposure to laser radiation produces an active form of oxygen that destroys the treated cancer cells. The laser radiation can be directed through a fibreoptic bronchoscope into the airways, through a gastroscope into the oesophagus, or through a cystoscope into the bladder. PDT causes minimal damage to healthy tissue, but as it cannot pass through more than about 3 cm of tissue, it is restricted to treating tumours on or just under the skin or on the lining of internal organs. Photodynamic therapy makes the skin and eyes sensitive to light for six weeks or more after treatment. 2. a treatment for wet age-related *macular degeneration that involves the intravenous injection of a light-sensitive agent (verteporfin, Visudyne) which passes to the abnormal leaking blood vessels in the retina. The agent is activated when a cold laser light is directed at the macula, sealing the abnormal vessels and thus preventing further leakage and macular damage. The effect is to limit visual loss and stabilize vision.

photomicrograph n. an enlarged photographic record of an object taken through an optical or electron microscope. Compare microphotograph.

photomultiplier tube an electronic device that magnifies the light emitted from a *scintillator by accelerating electrons in a high-voltage field. The resulting signal can be used to display the scintillations on a TV screen. Such devices are commonly used in *gamma cameras.

photophobia n. discomfort caused by exposure to light. In most cases the light simply aggravates already existing discomfort from eye disease; contraction of the eyelids and other reactions aimed at avoiding the light follow. Photophobia may be associated with dilation of the pupils as a result of eye drops or with migraine, measles, German measles, meningitis, iritis, or disruption of the sensitive corneal epithelium.

photophthalmia n. inflammation of the eye due to exposure to light. It is usually caused by the damaging effect of ultraviolet light on the cornea, for example in snow blindness or when lying under a sunbed.

photopic adj. relating to or describing conditions of bright illumination. For example, photopic vision is vision in bright light, in which the *cones of the retina are responsible for visual sensation. —photopia n.

photopsia n. the sensation of flashes of light caused by mechanical stimulation of the retina of the eye, usually due to traction by the attached vitreous humour when the eye is moved.

photoradiation n. see photodynamic therapy.

photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) see keratectomy.

photoretinitis n. damage to the retina of the eye caused by looking at the sun without adequate protection for the eyes. The retina may be burnt by the intense light focused on it; this affects the central part of the visual field, which may be permanently lost (sun blindness).

photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) a technique to vaporize the prostate by means of a high-energy laser, used to relieve *lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland). It is associated with less blood loss and a shorter hospital stay than a traditional TURP (see resection), but can only be used on smaller prostates.

photosensitivity n. abnormal reaction of the skin to sunlight. This characterizes certain skin diseases (see photodermatosis). Photosensitivity reactions may also occur in those taking such drugs as thiazide diuretics, furosemide, amiodarone, and NSAIDs. In these cases the effect may resemble severe sunburn. —photosensitive adj.

photosynthesis n. the process whereby green plants and some bacteria manufacture carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water, using energy absorbed from sunlight by the green pigment chlorophyll. In green plants this complex process may be summarized thus:



phototaxis n. movement of a cell or organism in response to a stimulus of light.

phototherapeutic keratectomy see keratectomy.

phototherapy n. 1. treatment that involves exposure to ultraviolet or infrared radiation. For example, ultraviolet B radiation is used for treating severe psoriasis. See also PUVA. 2. see photodynamic therapy.

phototoxicity n. damage caused by prolonged exposure to light; for example, retinal phototoxicity is damage to the retina of the eye as a result of prolonged exposure to light.

photuria n. the excretion of phosphorescent urine, which glows in the dark, due to the presence of certain phosphorus-containing compounds derived from phosphates.

PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) a screening tool designed to identify people who may suffer from depression. The instrument’s nine questions are based on DSM diagnostic criteria for depression. Each item is scored by the patient from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score of ≥10 indicates a reasonably high likelihood of major depression. It has been validated for use in primary care, in which it is commonly used not only for screening depression but also for monitoring the progress of treatment.

phren- (phreno-) combining form denoting 1. the mind or brain. 2. the diaphragm. 3. the phrenic nerve.

-phrenia combining form denoting a condition of the mind. Example: hebephrenia (schizophrenia affecting young adults).

phrenic crush 1. damage to the phrenic nerve as a result of trauma. 2. formerly, surgical crushing of a portion of the *phrenic nerve. This paralyses the diaphragm on the side operated upon, which is then pushed upwards by the abdominal contents, thus pressing on the lung and partially collapsing it. This operation was formerly often combined with *pneumoperitoneum in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but is now obsolete.

phrenic nerve the nerve that supplies the muscles of the diaphragm. On each side it arises in the neck from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical spinal roots and passes downwards between the lungs and the heart to reach the diaphragm. Impulses through the nerves from the brain bring about the regular contractions of the diaphragm during breathing.

phrenology n. the study of the bumps on the outside of the skull in order to determine a person’s character. It is based on the mistaken theory that the skull becomes modified over the different functional areas of the cortex of the brain.

Phrygian cap the normal radiological appearance of the tip of the gall bladder, seen in a minority of cholecystograms (see cholecystography). Its name is derived from its resemblance to the characteristic Balkan headgear.

PHS see Public Health Service.

Phthirus n. a widely distributed genus of lice. The crab (or pubic) louse, P. pubis, is a common parasite of humans that lives permanently attached to the body hair, particularly that of the pubic or perianal regions but also on the eyelashes and the hairs in the armpits. Crab lice are not known to transmit disease but their bites can irritate the skin (see pediculosis). An infestation may be acquired during sexual intercourse or from hairs left on clothing, towels, and lavatory seats.

phthisis n. 1. any disease resulting in wasting of tissues. Phthisis bulbi is a shrunken eyeball that has lost its function due to disease or damage. 2. a former name for pulmonary *tuberculosis.

phycomycosis n. a disease caused by parasitic fungi of the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, and Mucor. The disease affects the sinuses, the central nervous system, the lungs, and the skin tissues. The fungi are able to grow within the blood vessels of the lungs and nervous tissue, thus causing blood clots which cut off the blood supply (see infarction). Treatment with the antibiotic *amphotericin has proved effective.

phylogenesis n. the evolutionary history of a species or individual.

physi- (physio-) combining form denoting 1. physiology. 2. physical.

physical adj. (in medicine) relating to the body rather than to the mind. For example, a physical sign is one that a doctor can detect when examining a patient, such as abnormal dilation of the pupils or the absence of a knee-jerk reflex (see also functional disorder; organic disorder).

physical medicine a medical specialty established by the Royal Society of Medicine in 1931. Initially the members pioneered clinics devoted to the diagnosis and management of rheumatic diseases, but later extended their interests to the *rehabilitation of patients with physical disabilities ranging from asthma and hand injuries to back trouble and poliomyelitis. The term has caused confusion in recent years, with many doctors preferring the description rheumatology and rehabilitation for this specialist activity. Since 1972, however, when the Royal College of Physicians approved it, physical medicine has become the generally accepted term. See also rheumatology.

physician n. a registered medical practitioner who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of disease by other than surgical means. In the USA the term is applied to any authorized medical practitioner. See also Doctor.

physiological saline see saline.

physiological solution one of a group of solutions used to maintain tissues in a viable state.

phytophotodermatitis n. an eruption of linear blisters occurring after exposure to light in people who have been in contact with certain plants, such as wild parsnip or cow parsley, to which they are sensitive. A particularly dramatic reaction occurs with giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). The skin often appears brown as the blisters resolve.

phytotherapy n. medical treatment based exclusively on plant extracts and products. Plants have provided a wide range of important drugs (*taxanes among others) and current research into drugs from plants continues to be fruitful. However, it is essential that any drugs derived directly from plants should be extracted, purified, assayed, and tested before being used as medication. The use of crude plant extracts as medicines can be dangerous because seemingly identical samples of the same plant may contain widely differing amounts of the active ingredient.

phytotoxin n. any poisonous substance (toxin) produced by a plant, such as any of the toxins produced by fungi of the genus *Amanita.

pia (pia mater) n. the innermost of the three *meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The membrane is closely attached to the surface of the brain and spinal cord, faithfully following each fissure and sulcus. It contains numerous finely branching blood vessels that supply the nerve tissue within. The subarachnoid space separates it from the arachnoid.

pian n. see yaws.

PICC line peripherally inserted central catheter: a long flexible catheter usually inserted via a vein in the arm and the subclavian vein into the superior vena cava. It is used when prolonged intravenous access is required; for example, for infusional chemotherapy and *total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

pico- prefix denoting one million-millionth (10−12).

picornavirus n. one of a group of small RNA-containing viruses (pico = small; hence pico-RNA-virus). The group includes *Coxsackie viruses, *polioviruses, and *rhinoviruses.

picric acid (trinitrophenol) a yellow crystalline solid used as a dye and as a tissue *fixative.

picture archiving and communication system see PACS.

PICU (psychiatric intensive care unit) a unit especially designed for nursing the most acutely and severely mentally ill. PICUs are often locked wards with increased staffing levels. Usually patients stay on a PICU ward for the shortest possible period before being transferred to an open psychiatric ward.

PID 1. see pelvic inflammatory disease. 2. see prolapsed intervertebral disc.

Pierre Robin syndrome a congenital disease in which affected infants have a very small lower jawbone (mandible) and a cleft palate. They are susceptible to feeding and respiratory problems. [Pierre Robin (1867–1950), French dentist]

piezoelectric adj. denoting or relating to an electrically generated pulse or polarity that is caused by pressure.

pigeon chest forward protrusion of the breastbone resulting in deformity of the chest. The condition is painless and harmless. Medical name: pectus carinatum.

pigeon toe see in-toe gait.

The pigment *melanin occurs in the skin and in the iris of the eye. Important plant pigments include *chlorophyll and the *carotenoids.

pigmentation n. coloration produced in the body by the deposition of one pigment, especially in excessive amounts. Pigmentation may be produced by natural pigments, such as bile pigments (as in jaundice) or melanin, or by foreign material, such as lead or arsenic in chronic poisoning.

pigment epitheliopathy an inflammatory disease of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; see retina). Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is characterized by the presence of multiple cream-coloured irregular lesions scattered in the posterior segment of the eye. The disease occurs in young adults and usually affects both eyes. Visual acuity usually recovers with time.

pig-tail stents see stent.

piles n. see haemorrhoids.

pili (fimbriae) pl. n. (sing. pilus, fimbria) hairlike processes present on the surface of certain bacteria. They are thought to be involved in adhesion of bacteria to other cells and in transfer of DNA during *conjugation.

pilomatrixoma n. a benign (noncancerous) skin tumour that typically occurs in the head and neck area, including the eyelids. The tumour usually does not cause any symptoms and is commonest in children.

pilomotor nerves sympathetic nerves that supply muscle fibres in the skin, around the roots of hairs. Activity of the sympathetic nervous system causes the muscles to contract, raising the hairs and giving the *gooseflesh effect of fear or cold.

pilonidal sinus a short tract leading from an opening in the skin in or near the cleft at the top of the buttocks and containing hairs. The sinus may be recurrently infected, leading to pain and the discharge of pus. Treatment is by surgical opening and cleaning of the sinus.

pilosebaceous adj. relating to the hair follicles and their associated sebaceous glands.

pimozide n. an *antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia and some delusional disorders. It may cause serious disturbances of heart rhythm.

pimple n. a small inflamed swelling on the skin that contains pus. It may be the result of bacterial infection of a skin pore that has become obstructed with fatty secretions from the sebaceous glands. Pimples occurring in large numbers on the chest, back, and face are usually described as *acne, a common condition of adolescence.

PIN 1. see prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. 2. see penile intraepithelial neoplasia.

pinard n. an instrument used by midwives to auscultate the fetal heart. See intermittent auscultation.

pincement n. one of the techniques used in massage, in which pinches of the patient’s flesh are taken between finger and thumb and twisted or rolled before release. This is said to improve the tone of the skin, improve circulation, and alleviate underlying pain.

pineal gland (pineal body) a pea-sized mass of nerve tissue attached by a stalk to the posterior wall of the third ventricle of the brain, deep between the cerebral hemispheres at the back of the skull. It secretes the hormone *melatonin. The gland becomes calcified as age progresses, providing a useful landmark in X-rays of the skull. Anatomical name: epiphysis.

pinguecula n. a degenerative change in the conjunctiva of the eye, seen most commonly in the elderly and in those who live in hot dry climates. Thickened yellow triangles develop on the conjunctiva at the inner and outer margins of the cornea.

pink disease a severe illness of children of the teething age, marked by pink cold clammy hands and feet, heavy sweating, raised blood pressure, rapid pulse, photophobia, loss of appetite, and insomnia. Affected infants are very prone to secondary infection, which may be fatal. It has been suggested that the condition is an allergic reaction to mercury, since it used to occur when teething powders, lotions, and ointments containing mercury were used. Although there is no definite proof of this, the disease has virtually disappeared since all mercury-containing paediatric preparations have been banned. Medical names: acrodynia, erythroedema, erythromelalgia.

pink eye see conjunctivitis.

pink puffer the typical appearance of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who is breathless and flushed. See also blue bloater.

pinna (auricle) n. the flap of skin and cartilage that projects from the head at the exterior opening of the external auditory meatus of the *ear (see illustration). In humans the pinna is largely vestigial but it may be partly concerned with detecting the direction of sound sources.

The pinna.





pinnaplasty n. see otoplasty.

pinocytosis n. the intake of small droplets of fluid by a cell by cytoplasmic engulfment. It occurs in many white blood cells and in certain kidney and liver cells. Compare phagocytosis.

pins and needles see paraesthesia.

pinta n. a skin disease, prevalent in tropical America, that is caused by the spirochaete *Treponema carateum. The disease is thought to be transmitted either by direct contact between individuals or by flies that carry the infective spirochaetes on their bodies. Symptoms include thickening and eventual loss of pigment of the skin, particularly on the hands, wrists, feet, and ankles. Pinta is treated with penicillin G.

pinworm n. see threadworm.

PI-RADS Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System: see BI-RADS.

pirfenidone n. a drug with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties that is used to treat *idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is thought to reduce fibroblast proliferation, inhibit *transforming growth factor-β-stimulated collagen production, and reduce the production of fibrogenic mediators. Pirfenidone has also been shown to reduce production of inflammatory mediators, such as *tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 1 (IL-1). Side effects include gastrointestinal upsets.

piriform fossae two pear-shaped depressions that lie on either side of the opening to the larynx.

pituicyte n. a type of cell found in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, similar in appearance to an *astrocyte, with numerous fine branches that end in contact with the lining membrane of the blood channels in the gland.

pituitary apoplexy acute intrapituitary haemorrhage, usually into an existing tumour, presenting as severe headache and collapse. It is a medical emergency. Due to the sudden expansion in size of the gland with the haemorrhage, it is accompanied by lesions of the cranial nerves running close to the pituitary gland, causing paralysis of the muscles of the orbit and occasionally the face. Anterior pituitary insufficiency usually results, but posterior pituitary function survives. Surprisingly, pituitary function usually recovers.

pituitary gland (hypophysis) the master endocrine gland: a pea-sized body attached beneath the *hypothalamus in a bony cavity at the base of the skull. It has an anterior lobe (adenohypophysis), which secretes *thyroid-stimulating hormone, *ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone), the *gonadotrophins, *growth hormone, *prolactin, *lipotrophin, and *melanocyte-stimulating hormone. The secretion of all these hormones is regulated by specific releasing hormones, which are produced in the hypothalamus (see also corticotrophin-releasing hormone; gonadotrophin-releasing hormone; thyrotrophin-releasing hormone). The posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) secretes *vasopressin and *oxytocin, which are synthesized in the hypothalamus and transported to the pituitary, where they are stored before release.

pityriasis n. (originally) any of a group of skin diseases typified by the development of fine branlike scales. The term is now used only with a modifying adjective. Pityriasis alba is a common condition in children in which pale scaly patches occur on the face; it is related to atopic *eczema. Pityriasis rosea is a common skin rash, believed to be viral in origin, typically starting with a single patch (a herald patch) on the trunk and followed by an eruption of oval pink scaly *macules. The spots are often aligned along the ribs. The rash usually clears completely in about eight weeks. Pityriasis versicolor is a common chronic infection of the skin caused by the yeast Malassezia furfur, which produces a persistent pale or brown scaly rash on the trunk. Treatment with *selenium sulphide shampoo or with oral itraconazole readily kills the organism but the skin may take months to regain its normal colour. See also dandruff.

Pityrosporum n. see Malassezia.

pivmecillinam n. a *penicillin-type antibiotic used mainly to treat urinary-tract infections caused by many Gram-negative bacteria. Possible side-effects include allergic reactions, nausea, and vomiting.

pivot joint see trochoid joint.

pixel n. short for ‘picture element’, the smallest individual component of an electronically produced image. Numerical values are ascribed to each pixel, which describe its position and relative intensity and/or colour. A two-dimensional *matrix of pixels produces the final image.

pizotifen n. an antihistamine drug used to prevent severe migraine and cluster headaches. It acts by inhibiting the effects of *serotonin. Possible side-effects include dizziness, drowsiness, and weight gain.

placebo n. a medicine that is ineffective but may help to relieve a condition because the patient has faith in its powers. New drugs are tested against placebos in clinical trials: the drug’s effect is compared with the placebo response, which occurs even in the absence of any pharmacologically active substance in the placebo. Use of placebos in treatment is controversial, with some believing that such treatment compromises the patient’s *autonomy and compromises the virtue of honesty, thereby potentially undermining the doctor–patient relationship.

placenta n. an organ within the uterus by means of which the embryo is attached to the wall of the uterus. Its primary function is to provide the embryo with nourishment, eliminate its wastes, and exchange respiratory gases. This is accomplished by the close proximity of the maternal and fetal blood systems within the placenta. It also functions as a gland, secreting *human chorionic gonadotrophin, *progesterone, and oestrogens, which regulate the maintenance of pregnancy. See also afterbirth. —placental adj.

placenta accreta a condition in which the placenta is abnormally strongly attached to the wall of the uterus with superficial penetration of chorionic *villi into the underlying *myometrium. Women with *placenta praevia and at least one previous Caesarean delivery are considered to be at high risk for placenta accreta. When placenta accreta is thought to be likely, consultant obstetric and anaesthetic input are vital in planning and conducting the delivery. Radiological input with temporary uterine balloon tamponade may be considered, and methotrexate has been used. The risk of haemorrhage, blood transfusion, and hysterectomy should be discussed. In placenta increta the chorionic villi extend into the myometrium; a placenta percreta occurs where the chorionic villi penetrate through the myometrial wall and can invade the bladder. An emergency hysterectomy is usually necessary in these rare cases.

placental abruption see abruptio placentae.

placenta praevia a condition in which the placenta is situated wholly or partially in the lower and noncontractile part of the uterus. When this becomes elongated and stretched during the last few weeks of pregnancy, and the cervix becomes stretched either before or during labour, placental separation and haemorrhage will occur. The cause is not known. In the more severe degrees of placenta praevia, where the placenta is situated entirely before the presenting part of the fetus, delivery must be by Caesarean section. In lesser degrees of placenta praevia, vaginal delivery may be considered.

placentography (sonoplacentography) n. imaging of the pregnant uterus by ultrasonography in order to determine the position of the placenta.

placode n. any of the thickened areas of ectoderm in the embryo that will develop into nerve ganglia or the special sensory structures of the eye, ear, or nose.

plagiocephaly n. any distortion or lack of symmetry in the shape of the head, usually due to irregularity in the closure of the sutures between the bones of the skull.

plague n. 1. any epidemic disease with a high death rate. 2. an acute epidemic disease of rats and other wild rodents caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is transmitted to humans by rat fleas. Bubonic plague, the most common form of the disease, has an incubation period of 2–6 days. Headache, fever, weakness, aching limbs, and delirium develop and are followed by acute painful swellings of the lymph nodes (see bubo). In favourable cases the buboes burst after about a week, releasing pus, and then heal. In other cases bleeding under the skin, producing black patches, can lead to ulcers, which may prove fatal (hence the former name Black Death). In the most serious cases bacteria enter the bloodstream (septicaemic plague) or lungs (pneumonic plague); if untreated, these are nearly always fatal. Treatment with tetracycline, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol is effective; vaccination against the disease provides only partial protection.

plane n. a level or smooth surface, especially any of the imaginary flat surfaces – orientated in various directions – used to divide the body; for example, the *coronal and *sagittal planes.

planoconcave adj. describing a structure, such as a lens, that is flat on one side and concave on the other.

planoconvex adj. describing a structure, such as a lens, that is flat on one side and convex on the other.

plantar arch the arch in the sole of the foot formed by anastomosing branches of the plantar arteries.

plantar fasciitis (policeman’s heel) inflammation of the point of attachment of the *fascia in the sole of the foot to the calcaneus (heel bone), causing pain and localized tenderness of the heel. Treatments include heel pads, anti-inflammatory medication, steroid injections, or surgery. The inflammation takes 6–12 months to subside.

plantar reflex a reflex obtained by drawing a bluntly pointed object (such as a key) along the outer border of the sole of the foot from the heel to the little toe. The normal flexor response is a bunching and downward movement of the toes. An upward movement of the big toe is called an extensor response (or Babinski reflex or response). In all persons over the age of 18 months this is a sensitive indication of damage to the *pyramidal system in either the brain or spinal cord.

plantar wart a *wart occurring on the sole of the foot.

plantigrade adj. walking on the entire sole of the foot: a habit of humans, bears, and some other animals.

plaque n. 1. a layer that forms on the surface of a tooth, principally at its neck, composed of bacteria in an organic matrix (*biofilm). Under certain conditions the plaque may cause *gingivitis, *periodontal disease, or *dental caries. The purpose of oral hygiene is to remove plaque. 2. a raised patch on the skin, formed by *papules enlarging or coalescing to form an area 2 cm or more across. 3. a deposit, consisting of a fatty core covered with a fibrous cap, that develops on the inner wall of an artery in atherosclerosis (see atheroma). 4. any flat and often raised patch, for example on mucous membrane, resulting from local damage.

-plasia combining form denoting formation; development. Example: hyperplasia (excessive tissue formation).

plasm- (plasmo-) combining form denoting 1. blood plasma. 2. protoplasm or cytoplasm.

plasma (blood plasma) n. the straw-coloured fluid in which the blood cells are suspended. It consists of a solution of various inorganic salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, etc., with a high concentration of protein (approximately 70 g/l) and a variety of trace substances.

plasma cells antibody-producing cells found in blood-forming tissue and also in the epithelium of the lungs and gut. They develop in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen when antigens stimulate B *lymphocytes to produce the precursor cells that give rise to them. Malignant proliferation of plasma cells results in either a *plasmacytoma or multiple *myeloma.

plasma coagulation a type of *electrocoagulation used to arrest haemorrhage or destroy abnormal tissue. A stream of inert gas, such as argon or helium, is ionized, thereby carrying electrical energy to adjacent tissue; there is no physical contact between the plasma coagulation apparatus and the tissue.

plasmacytoma n. a malignant tumour of plasma cells, often known as a ‘solitary myeloma’. Although usually occurring as a single tumour in bone marrow or more rarely soft tissue (extramedullary plasmacytoma), it may be multiple, in which case it is classified as a multiple myeloma. All of these tumours may produce the abnormal gammaglobulins that are characteristic of myeloma, and they may progress to widespread myeloma.

Four species cause *malaria: P. vivax, P. ovale, P. falciparum, and P. malariae.

plasmolysis n. a process occurring in bacteria and plants in which the protoplasm shrinks away from the rigid cell wall when the cell is placed in a *hypertonic solution. Plasmolysis is due to withdrawal of water from the cell by *osmosis.

plaster n. adhesive tape used in shaped pieces or as a bandage to keep a dressing in place.

plaster model (in dentistry) an accurate positive cast of the teeth and jaws made from modified plaster of Paris. A pair of models are used to study the dentition, particularly before treatment. Models are also used to construct dentures, orthodontic appliances, and such restorations as crowns.

-plasty combining form denoting plastic surgery. Example: labioplasty (of the lips).

platelet (thrombocyte) n. a disc-shaped cell structure, 1–2 μm in diameter, that is present in the blood. With *Romanowsky stains platelets appear as fragments of pale-blue cytoplasm with a few red granules. They have several functions, all relating to the arrest of bleeding (see blood coagulation; platelet activation). There are normally 150–400 × 109 platelets per litre of blood. See also thrombopoiesis.

platelet activation the process whereby platelets adhere to collagen released from endothelial cells in damaged blood vessels and aggregate to form a plug. An important metabolic pathway in platelets converts membrane phospholipids to *thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which can activate platelets. ADP, released from platelet granules, and *thrombin are other activators. The adhesive and aggregation reactions of platelets are mediated through surface membrane glycoproteins (Glp), Glp Ib and Glp IIb/IIIa. Aspirin acts as an *antiplatelet drug by irreversibly inhibiting one of the enzymes of this pathway, cyclo-oxygenase. Clopidrogel inhibits the ADP receptor on platelet membranes, and *abciximab blocks platelet aggregation by inhibiting Glp IIb/IIIa (see illustration overleaf).

ploidy n. the condition of having multiple the normal number of chromosomes for the species. An increase in ploidy in the cells of a malignant tumour usually indicates greater aggressiveness and ability to invade.

plombage n. 1. a technique used in surgery for the correction of retinal detachment. A small piece of silicone plastic is sewn on the outside of the eyeball to produce an indentation over the retinal hole or tear to allow the retina to reattach. 2. the insertion of plastic balls into the pleural cavity to cause collapse of the lung. This was done in the days before effective antituberculous drugs to help tuberculosis to heal.

It is also offered to people over the age of 65 as a single vaccination that will protect for life.

pneumococcus n. (pl. pneumococci) the bacterium *Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is associated with pneumonia and pneumococcal meningitis. —pneumococcal adj.

pneumoconiosis n. a group of lung diseases caused by inhaling dust. The dust particles must be less than 0.5 μm in diameter to reach the depths of the lung and there is usually a long period after initial exposure before shadows appear on the chest X-ray and breathlessness develops. In practice industrial exposure to coal dust (see coal-worker’s pneumoconiosis), silica (see silicosis), and asbestos (see asbestosis) produces most of the cases of pneumoconiosis. In Britain such cases are examined by the Medical Boarding Centres (Respiratory Diseases), on whose advice statutory compensation for industrial injury may be awarded.

pneumoencephalography n. a technique used in the X-ray diagnosis of disease within the skull. Air is introduced into the cavities (ventricles) of the brain to displace the cerebrospinal fluid, thus acting as a *contrast medium. X-ray photographs show the size and disposition of the ventricles and the subarachnoid spaces. The technique has largely been superseded by CT and MRI scanning.

pneumograph n. an instrument used to record the movements made during respiration.

pneumolysis n. see pleurolysis.

pneumomediastinum n. air in the mediastinum visible on chest X-ray. It can be a complication of surgical *emphysema due to pneumothorax, but the air can originate from the upper airways or the upper gastrointestinal tract. A rare cause is gas-forming organisms. See Hamman’s sign.

pneumon- (pneumono-) combining form denoting the lung(s). Example: pneumonopexy (surgical fixation to the chest wall).

pneumonectomy n. surgical removal of a lung, usually for cancer.

pneumonia n. inflammation of the lung caused by bacteria, in which the air sacs (*alveoli) become filled with inflammatory cells and the lung becomes solid (see consolidation). The symptoms include those of any infection (fever, malaise, headaches, etc.), together with cough and chest pain. Pneumonias may be classified in different ways.

(1) According to the X-ray appearance. Lobar pneumonia affects whole lobes and is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, while lobular pneumonia refers to multiple patchy shadows in a localized or segmental area. When these multiple shadows are widespread, the term bronchopneumonia is used. In bronchopneumonia, the infection starts in a number of small bronchi and spreads in a patchy manner into the alveoli. Interstitial pneumonia is the result of an inflammatory process centred within the alveolar walls rather than the alveolar airspaces. It may be due to a variety of factors, including certain infections, drugs, inhalation of fumes, and exposure to high concentrations of oxygen.

(2) According to the infecting organism. The most common organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (among others) may all be responsible for the infection. See also atypical pneumonia; viral pneumonia.

(3) According to the clinical and environmental circumstances under which the pneumonia is acquired. These infections are divided into community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia, and pneumonias occurring in immunocompromised subjects (including those with AIDS). The organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia are totally different from those in the other groups.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the clinical situation and on microbiological studies, will result in complete recovery in the majority of patients.

pneumonitis n. inflammation of the lung that is confined to the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) and often caused by viruses or unknown agents. It may be acute and transient or chronic, leading to increasing respiratory disability. It does not respond to antibiotics but corticosteroids may be helpful. Compare pneumonia.

pneumopericardium n. the presence of air within the membranous sac surrounding the heart. See hydropneumopericardium.

pneumoperitoneum n. air or gas in the peritoneal or abdominal cavity, usually due to a perforation of the stomach or bowel. It is diagnosed by X-ray of the erect chest or by CT or ultrasound imaging. Pneumoperitoneum may be induced for diagnostic purposes (e.g. *laparoscopy). A former treatment of tuberculosis was the deliberate injection of air into the peritoneal cavity to allow the tuberculous lung to be rested (artificial pneumoperitoneum); this was frequently combined with *phrenic crush.

pneumoretinopexy n. a surgical technique in which an inert gas bubble is injected into the eye to press and seal breaks in the retina. When the retina is flat, a laser beam or *cryoretinopexy is applied to cause scarring and permanently seal the tear.

pneumothorax n. air in the *pleural cavity. Any breach of the lung surface or chest wall allows air to enter the pleural cavity, causing the lung to collapse. The leak can occur without apparent cause, in otherwise healthy people (spontaneous pneumothorax), or result from injuries to the chest (traumatic pneumothorax). In tension pneumothorax a breach in the lung surface acts as a valve, admitting air into the pleural cavity when the patient breathes in but preventing its escape when he breathes out. This air must be let out by surgical incision.

A former treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis – artificial pneumothorax – was the deliberate injection of air into the pleural cavity to collapse the lung and allow the tuberculous areas to heal.

pneumotonometer (noncontact tonometer) n. an instrument that blows a puff of air at the cornea to cause flattening and hence measure intraocular pressure. It is commonly used by optometrists in tests for glaucoma.

pod- combining form denoting the foot.

podagra n. gout of the foot, especially the big toe.

podalic version (internal podalic version) a procedure in which the position of a fetus in the uterus is altered so that its feet will emerge first at birth. It is used mainly to deliver a second twin that is presenting transversely or obliquely. See also cephalic version.

podiatry (chiropody) n. the study and care of the foot, including its normal structure, its diseases, and their treatment. The main role of a podiatrist (chiropodist) is to assess, diagnose, and treat abnormalities and diseases of the foot and to give advice on proper foot care and the prevention of foot problems.

podocyte n. an epithelial cell in the *glomerulus that spreads over the capillary basement membrane and has branching tentacle-like processes that interdigitate with adjacent cells. The podocytes leave gaps or thin filtration slits. The slits are covered by slit diaphragms, which are composed of a number of cell-surface proteins including *nephrin, podocalyxin, and P-cadherin, which ensure that large molecules, such as albumin and gammaglobulin, are not filtered. Podocytes are damaged in *minimal change nephropathy and a major target of injury in *HIVAN.

podopompholyx n. see pompholyx.

POEMS syndrome a syndrome, mostly reported in Japanese males, consisting of polyneuropathy (see peripheral neuropathy), organomegaly, endocrine failure, M protein (immunoglobulins) in the plasma, and skin changes, such as thickening, hirsutism, or excess sweating. Each of the components occurs with varying consistency. The cause is not known but it is not thought to be autoimmune in nature.

-poiesis combining form denoting formation; production. Example: haemopoiesis (of blood cells).

polioencephalomyelitis n. any virus infection of the central nervous system affecting the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord. *Rabies is the outstanding example.

poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis, polio) n. an infectious virus disease affecting the central nervous system. The virus is excreted in the faeces of an infected person and the disease is therefore most common where sanitation is poor. However, epidemics may occur in more hygienic conditions, where individuals have not acquired immunity to the disease during infancy. Symptoms commence 7–12 days after infection. In most cases paralysis does not occur: in abortive poliomyelitis only the throat and intestines are infected and the symptoms are those of a stomach upset or influenza; in nonparalytic poliomyelitis these symptoms are accompanied by muscle stiffness, particularly in the neck and back. Paralytic poliomyelitis is much less common. The symptoms of the milder forms of the disease are followed by weakness and eventual paralysis of the muscles: in bulbar poliomyelitis the muscles of the respiratory system are involved and breathing is affected. See also post-polio syndrome.

There is no specific treatment, apart from measures to relieve the symptoms: cases of bulbar polio may require the use of a *ventilator. Immunization, using the *Sabin vaccine (taken orally) or the *Salk vaccine (injected), is highly effective.

poliovirus n. one of a small group of RNA-containing viruses causing *poliomyelitis. They are included within the *picornavirus group.

polycystic disease of the kidneys either of two inherited disorders in which renal cysts are a common feature. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) occurs in about 1 in 20,000 live births. It is due to a single mutation on chromosome 6 for the gene encoding the protein fibrocystin. The majority of cases are diagnosed before or at birth. The most severely affected fetuses have enlarged kidneys and *oligohydramnios due to poor fetal renal output. These fetuses develop the ‘Potter’ phenotype with characteristic facies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and deformities of the spine and limbs. Those surviving the neonatal period (50–70%) develop varying degrees of renal impairment but this may not proceed to end-stage until early adulthood.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1000 individuals and is one of the most common hereditary diseases. Two types have been defined. ADPKD 1 is the commonest and responsible for about 85% of cases. It is due to a mutation in the PKD1 gene on chromosome 16, which encodes polycystin 1, an *ion-channel-regulating protein. ADPKD2 is due to a mutation in the PKD2 gene on chromosome 4, which encodes the protein polycystin 2, a calcium-release channel. ADPKD2 tends to be a milder disease with later presentation.

ADPKD is a multisystem disorder that is also associated with cyst formation in other organs (particularly the liver), cardiovascular disorders, and colonic diverticular disease. Renal disease presents in early adult life with haematuria, loin pain, urinary tract infection, hypertension, renal stone disease, or the finding of a mass in the abdomen. Other cases are identified by family contact tracing; the findings of a few cysts on renal ultrasonography in a young adult with a family history of ADPKD is highly suggestive of the disease. Renal disease is progressive and about 50% of patients will have reached end-stage by the time they enter their seventh decade. The progress of the renal failure can be slowed by good blood pressure control. In the UK, patients with ADPKD are responsible for 5–10% of the total on renal replacement therapy.

There are a number of separate rare autosomal dominant conditions other than ADPKD1 and ADPKD 2 that can present with polycystic kidneys. These include *von Hippel-Lindau disease and *tuberous sclerosis.

polycystic ovary (PCO) the presence of more than 12 follicles in each ovary (2–9 mm in diameter), or increased ovarian volume (>10 ml), or both. The presence of enlarged ovaries with multiple small cysts and a hypervascularized androgen-secreting stroma (connective tissue) is associated with signs of androgen excess (see polycystic ovary syndrome).

polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, Stein–Leventhal syndrome) a heterogeneous disorder characterized by *hyperandrogenism (clinical hirsutism, biochemical hyperandrogenism, or both) and ovarian dysfunction (with *polycystic ovaries), which results in amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea (absent or infrequent menstrual periods) and is associated with subfertility (from lack of ovulatory menstrual cycles). The condition is associated with obesity and *insulin resistance, which increase the risk of type 2 *diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Treatment is based on dietary and exercise advice, *metformin, hormones to regulate the menstrual cycle, and in cases of subfertility, *clomifene to induce ovulation; the hyperandrogenism usually responds to *anti-androgens.

polycystin n. see polycystic disease of the kidneys.

polycythaemia n. an increase in the *packed cell volume (haematocrit) in the blood. This may be due either to a decrease in the total volume of the plasma (relative polycythaemia) or to an increase in the total volume of the red cells (absolute polycythaemia). The latter may occur as a primary disease (see polycythaemia vera) or as a secondary condition in association with various respiratory or circulatory disorders that cause deficiency of oxygen in the tissues and with certain tumours, such as carcinoma of the kidney.

polycythaemia vera (polycythaemia rubra vera, Vaquez–Osler disease) a disease in which the number of red cells in the blood is greatly increased (see also polycythaemia). There is often also an increase in the numbers of white blood cells and platelets. Symptoms include headache, thromboses, *cyanosis, *plethora, and itching. Polycythaemia vera may be treated by blood-letting, but more severe cases may need to be treated with cytotoxic drugs. The cause of the disease is not known.

polydactylism n. see hyperdactylism.

polydipsia n. abnormally intense thirst, leading to the drinking of large quantities of fluid. This is a symptom typical of *diabetes mellitus and *diabetes insipidus but it can occur in the absence of any metabolic abnormality (psychogenic polydipsia). See also water-deprivation test.

polygene n. one of a number of genes that together control a single characteristic in an individual. Each polygene has only a slight effect and the expression of a set of polygenes is the result of their combined interaction. Characteristics controlled by polygenes are usually of a quantitative nature, e.g. height. See also multifactorial. —polygenic adj.

polyhydramnios (hydramnios) n. an increase in the amount of *amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, which occurs usually in the third *trimester and may be associated with maternal diabetes, multiple pregnancy, any fetal anomaly causing impaired swallowing, or placental abnormality.

polymer n. a substance formed by the linkage of a large number of smaller molecules known as monomers. An example of a monomer is glucose, whose molecules link together to form glycogen, a polymer. Polymers may have molecular weights from a few thousands to many millions. Polymers made up of a single type of monomer are known as homopolymers; those of two or more monomers as heteropolymers.

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a technique of molecular genetics in which a particular sequence of DNA can be isolated and amplified sufficiently to enable genetic analysis. The technique may be utilized, for example, in the identification of viruses in tissue samples, e.g. human papillomavirus in cervical smears.

polymorph (polymorphonuclear leucocyte) n. a type of white blood cell with a lobed nucleus. See basophil; eosinophil; neutrophil.

polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP) intensely itchy papules and weals on the abdomen (except the umbilicus), upper limbs, and buttocks, usually within the *striae gravidarum; it is also known as PUPPP (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy). It occurs in 1 in 250 first pregnancies late in the third trimester. This condition is harmless to mother and baby, but can be very annoying. It lasts an average of 6 weeks and resolves spontaneously 1–2 weeks after delivery. The most severe itching normally lasts for no more than a week.

polymorphism n. (in genetics) the occurrence of a chromosome or a genetic character in more than one form, resulting in the coexistence of more than one morphological type in the same population.

polymorphous light eruption see photodermatosis.

polymyalgia rheumatica a rheumatic disease causing aching and progressive stiffness of the muscles of the shoulders and hips after inactivity. These symptoms are typically associated with loss of appetite, fatigue, night sweats, and a raised *ESR. The condition is most common in the elderly, rarely occurring before the age of 50. The symptoms respond rapidly and effectively to corticosteroid treatment, which must usually be continued for several years. It is sometimes associated with temporal *arteritis.

polymyositis n. an autoimmune disease of the muscles that may be acute or chronic. It particularly affects the muscles of the shoulder and hip girdles, which are weak and tender to the touch. Microscopic examination of the affected muscles shows diffuse inflammatory changes; treatment is with *corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant drugs. The skin may be reddened and atrophic.

polyopia n. the sensation of multiple images of one object. It is sometimes experienced by people with early cataract. See also diplopia.

polyorchidism n. a congenital abnormality resulting in more than two testes.

polyp (polypus) n. a growth, usually benign, protruding from a mucous membrane. Polyps are commonly found in the nose and sinuses, giving rise to obstruction, chronic infection, and discharge. They are often present in patients with allergic rhinitis, in whom they may develop in response to long-term antigenic stimulation. Other sites of occurrence include the ear, the stomach, and the colon. Colonic polyps in the adult population are commonly seen in patients above the age of 50 and approximately 25% are multiple. Adenomatous colonic polyps (especially if large) have malignant potential, particularly so in larger polyps. Colonoscopy helps to detect and remove colonic polyps. Juvenile polyps occur in the intestine (usually colon or rectum) of infants or young people; sometimes they are multiple (juvenile polyposis). In the latter form there is a risk of malignant change (25% of cases) but most juvenile polyps are benign (see also polyposis; Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Polyps are usually removed endoscopically (see polypectomy); polyps that are large, difficult to remove endoscopically, or malignant require surgery.

polypectomy n. the endoscopic or surgical removal of a *polyp. The technique used depends upon the site and size of the polyp. Endoscopically, polyps can be removed by various methods. A hot biopsy involves coagulation of a small polyp using a diathermy current passed through biopsy forceps, which obtains a sample for analysis at the same time. Cold biopsy involves removal of a polyp using forceps alone, thereby decreasing the perforation risk. Snare polypectomy uses a wire loop (snare) to cut through the base of the polyp. This is performed with or without a diathermy current (hot snare vs. cold snare); the current reduces the risk of bleeding by coagulating local blood vessels as the snare cuts through the polyp. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) involves lifting a flat polyp by injecting a hypertonic solution into the submucosa beneath the polyp followed by snare polypectomy with diathermy. Nasal polyps may be removed using *endoscopic sinus surgery techniques, sometimes utilizing a *microdebrider.

polypeptide n. a molecule consisting of three or more amino acids linked together by *peptide bonds. *Protein molecules are polypeptides.

polyphagia n. excessive eating.

polypoid adj. having the appearance of a *polyp.

polyposis n. a condition in which numerous *polyps form in an organ or tissue. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease (caused by a defective dominant gene) in which multiple *adenomas develop in the intestine, usually the large bowel or rectum, at an early age. As these polyps almost invariably become malignant, patients are usually advised to undergo total removal of the affected bowel. See also Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Compare hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer; pseudopolyposis.

polypus n. see polyp.

polyradiculitis (polyradiculopathy) n. any disorder of the peripheral nerves (see neuropathy) in which the brunt of the disease falls on the nerve roots where they emerge from the spinal cord.

Other causes include infections (such as syphilis), herpesviruses, and tumours (such as lymphoma or other forms of cancer).

polyribosome n. see polysome.

polysaccharide n. a *carbohydrate formed from many monosaccharides joined together in long linear or branched chains. Polysaccharides have two important functions: (1) as storage forms of energy; for example *glycogen in animals and *starch in plants, and (2) as structural elements; for example *mucopolysaccharides in animals and *cellulose in plants.

polyserositis n. inflammation of the membranes that line the chest, abdomen, and joints, with accumulation of fluid in the cavities. Commonly the condition is inherited and intermittent and is termed familial Mediterranean fever. If complicated by infiltration of major organs by a glycoprotein (see amyloidosis) the disease usually proves fatal. Regular administration of colchicine will prevent the attacks in 95% of patients.

polysome (polyribosome) n. a structure that occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and consists of a group of *ribosomes linked together by *messenger RNA molecules: formed during protein synthesis.

polythelia n. a congenital excess of nipples (see pleomastia).

polyuria n. the production of large volumes of urine, which is dilute and of a pale colour. The phenomenon may be due simply to excessive liquid intake or to disease, particularly diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and kidney disorders.

pomalidomide n. a derivative of *thalidomide with similar properties. It is taken in the treatment of relapsed or refractory myeloma. The main side-effects include lethargy, low blood counts, and thromboembolism; this drug should not be used in women who are pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant.

pompholyx n. *eczema of the hands (see also cheiropompholyx) and feet (podopompholyx). Because the horny layer of the skin in these parts is so thick, the vesicles typical of eczema cannot rupture; they therefore persist in the skin, looking like sago grains. There is intense itching until the skin eventually peels. There may be secondary infection due to scratching. Pompholyx is commonest in early adulthood and attacks occur suddenly, lasting some weeks. The disease may be recurrent or persist as a chronic condition.

pons n. 1. (pons Varolii) the part of the *brainstem that links the medulla oblongata and the thalamus, bulging forwards in front of the cerebellum, from which it is separated by the fourth ventricle.

porfimer sodium see photodynamic therapy.

porocephaliasis n. a rare infestation of the nasal cavities, windpipe, lungs, liver, or spleen by the nymphs of the parasitic arthropod *Porocephalus. Humans become infected on consumption of water or uncooked vegetables contaminated with the parasite’s eggs. There may be some abdominal pain while the parasite is in the gut but in many cases there are no symptoms.

Porocephalus n. a genus of wormlike arthropods occurring mainly in tropical Africa and India. The legless adults are parasites in the lungs of snakes. The eggs, which are ejected with the snake’s bronchial secretions, may be accidentally swallowed by humans. The larva bores through the gut wall and usually migrates to the liver, where it develops into a nymph (see porocephaliasis).

porphin n. a complex nitrogen-containing ring structure and parent compound of the *porphyrins.

porphobilinogen n. a pigment that appears in the urine of individuals with acute *porphyria, causing it to darken if left standing.

porphyria n. one of a group of rare disorders due to *inborn errors of metabolism in which there are deficiencies in the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of haem. The accumulation of the enzyme’s substrate gives rise to symptoms of the disorder. The defect may be primarily in the liver (hepatic porphyria) or in the bone marrow (erythropoietic porphyria) or both. The prominent features include the excretion of *porphyrins and their derivatives in the urine, which may change colour on standing (see porphobilinogen); sensitivity of the skin to sunlight causing chronic inflammation or blistering; inflammation of the nerves (neuritis); mental disturbances; and attacks of abdominal pain. The commonest porphyria is porphyria cutanea tarda, which affects up to 1 in 5000 people in some countries. It is a hereditary or acquired hepatic porphyria in which light-exposed areas of the skin become blistered and fragile. Acute intermittent porphyria is a hereditary hepatic porphyria characterized by recurrent attacks of acute abdominal pain, severe constipation, and psychotic behaviour. Factors triggering attacks include alcohol and many drugs.

porphyrin n. one of a number of pigments derived from *porphin, which are widely distributed in living things. All porphyrins form chelates with iron, magnesium, zinc, nickel, copper, and cobalt. These chelates are constituents of *haemoglobin, *myoglobin, the *cytochromes, and chlorophyll, and are thus important in many oxidation/reduction reactions in all living organisms. See also protoporphyrin IX.

porphyrinuria n. the presence in the urine of breakdown products of the red blood pigment haemoglobin (porphyrins), sometimes causing discoloration. See porphyria; porphobilinogen.

porta n. the aperture in an organ through which its associated vessels pass. Such an opening occurs in the liver (porta hepatis).

portable adj. (in radiography) referring to images obtained by the bedside of the patient using light-weight equipment, rather than in the radiography department. The quality of portable radiographs is usually limited due to compromises in the equipment design to keep it light and movable, which is necessary when patients cannot easily be moved (for example, on intensive therapy units).

portacaval anastomosis (portacaval shunt) 1. a surgical technique in which the hepatic portal vein is joined to the inferior vena cava. Blood draining from the abdominal viscera is thus diverted past the liver. It is no longer widely used in the treatment of *portal hypertension. 2. any of the natural communications between the branches of the hepatic portal vein in the liver and the inferior vena cava.

portal adj. 1. relating to the portal vein or system. 2. relating to a porta.

portal hypertension a state in which the pressure within the hepatic *portal vein is increased, causing enlargement of the spleen, development of *oesophageal varices (with increased risk of bleeding), and accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (*ascites). The commonest cause is liver *cirrhosis, but other diseases of the liver or thrombosis of the portal vein may precipitate portal hypertension. Treatment includes *diuretics, band ligation or beta blockers for varices, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS). This involves the radiological implantation of a stent that bridges the portal and hepatic veins, thus decompressing the portal system. TIPSS has largely replaced *portacaval anastomosis.

portal image an electronic image taken during radiotherapy treatment to verify the position of radiation beams.

portal system a vein or group of veins that terminates at both ends in a capillary bed. The best known is the hepatic portal system, which consists of the *portal vein and its tributaries (see illustration). Blood is drained from the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and small and large intestines into veins that merge to form the portal vein leading to the liver. Here the portal vein branches, ending in many small capillaries called *sinusoids. These permit the passage into the liver cells of nutrients absorbed by blood from the intestines.

The hepatic portal system.





portal vein a short vein, about 8 cm long, forming part of the hepatic *portal system. It receives many tributaries, including the splenic vein from the spleen and pancreas, the gastric vein from the stomach, the mesenteric vein from the small and large intestines, and the rectal vein from the rectum and anus.

port-wine stain see naevus.

positive adj. see normative.

positive-pressure ventilation see noninvasive ventilation.

positive symptoms (in psychiatry) symptoms of schizophrenia characterized by a distortion of some aspect of functioning, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disordered speech. Compare negative symptoms.

positron n. an electrically charged particle released in some radioactive decays, notably fluorine-18 or nitrogen-13, that has the same mass as an electron but opposite charge. It has a very short lifetime as it quickly reacts with an electron (annihilation) to produce a pair of *gamma rays, which are emitted in diametrically opposite directions. The energy of each gamma ray is always 511 keV.

positron emission tomography (PET) a technique in nuclear medicine for *cross-sectional imaging that enables a noninvasive assessment and localization of metabolic activity to be made. Originally used to study activity in the brain, PET is now also used for investigating the chest and abdomen. Emission of a *positron by a radioisotope results in annihilation of the positron on collision with an electron, and the creation of two gamma rays of known energy travelling in exactly opposite directions. The PET scanner has detectors on each side of the patient to detect the simultaneous arrival of the gamma rays. Images are created using reconstruction *algorithms similar to CT scanning. *Fluorodeoxyglucose, labelled with fluorine-18, is used to examine glucose metabolism, and ammonia, labelled with nitrogen-13, gives information on perfusion. Carbon-11 and oxygen-15 can also be used as radioisotopes for PET scanning. Some diseases result in decreased uptake of the radio-labelled material due to decreased function; others show increased glucose metabolism and concentrate the isotope avidly. In this way functional activity of the tissues can be compared with anatomical images obtained by CT or MRI scanning (see PET/CT scanning). Localized areas of increased glucose uptake revealed by PET scans can sometimes signify functional activity of malignant cells, which use more glucose than normal cells, although other processes, such as infection, can produce similar scans. PET scans can help to localize metastatic disease (see metastasis) that is not identified by other scanning techniques. See also tomography. Compare computerized tomography.

posology n. the science of the dosage of medicines.

posset n. a small amount of milk that is regurgitated, usually with some wind, by many babies after feeding.

Possum n. a device that enables severely paralysed patients to use typewriters, adding machines, telephones, and a wide variety of other machines. Modern Possums are operated by micro-switches that require only the slightest movement in any limb. The original device worked by blowing and sucking a mouthpiece. The name derives from Patient-Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM).

POSSUM scoring physiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of morbidity and mortality: a tool used by anaesthetists in the perioperative period to determine the risks associated with surgery in an individual patient. This can be used to guide such decisions as the appropriateness of surgery and the requirement for intensive care postoperatively.

postcoital contraception (emergency contraception) prevention of pregnancy after intercourse has taken place. This can be achieved by two methods, which aim to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum in the uterus: (1) an oral dose of *levonorgestrel or *ulipristal taken within 72 hours and 120 hours, respectively, of unprotected intercourse; and (2) insertion of an *IUCD within five days of unprotected intercourse.

postcoital test a test used in the investigation of infertility. A specimen of cervical mucus, taken 6–24 hours after coitus, is examined under a microscope. The appearance of 10 or more progressively motile spermatozoa per high-power field in the specimen indicates that there is no abnormal reaction between spermatozoa and mucus. The test should be undertaken in the postovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.

posterior adj. situated at or near the back of the body or an organ. The posterior chamber of the eye is the rear section, behind the lens, which is filled with vitreous humour.

posterior capsular opacification progressive clouding of the posterior lens capsule due to *Elschnig pearls and proliferation of lens fibres following extracapsular *cataract extraction by *phacoemulsification. This can lead to clouding of vision and is treated with YAG laser *capsulotomy.

postero- combining form denoting posterior. Example: posterolateral (behind and at the side of).

posteroanterior (PA) adj. from the back to the front. In radiography it refers to the direction of the X-ray beam (i.e. from the back to the front of the patient); thus a PA radiograph is taken with the X-ray film in front of the patient. Normally, a chest radiograph will be PA: since the heart is in the front of the chest, its size can be most accurately assessed if the X-ray film is in front of the chest. Compare decubitus; anteroposterior.

postganglionic adj. describing a neuron in a nerve pathway that starts at a ganglion and ends at the muscle or gland that it supplies. In the sympathetic nervous system, postganglionic fibres are *adrenergic, unlike those in the parasympathetic system, which are *cholinergic. Compare preganglionic.

post mortem Latin: after death. See autopsy.

postnasal space see nasopharynx.

postnatal depression *depression that starts after childbirth. *Bonding between the mother and child can be impaired (particularly in the case of male children), leading to *attachment disorders if the illness is not diagnosed and treated. Postnatal depression occurs in about 10% of women (in the UK women are routinely screened for it after childbirth) and responds to the treatment strategies used for other forms of depression, such as *antidepressant medication and *cognitive behavioural therapy; in rare cases hospital admission is needed, ideally to a mother-and-baby unit. Compare baby blues; puerperal psychosis.

postoperative adj. following surgery: referring to the condition of a patient or to the treatment given at this time.

Major (or atonic) PPH, in which blood loss exceeds 1000 ml, is due to failure of the uterus to contract after delivery. It may be caused by retained products of conception or may occur after a long labour, trauma (e.g. from cervical or vaginal tears), or thrombin deficiency. An emergency hysterectomy may be required. See also B-Lynch brace suture; Rusch catheter.

postpartum sepsis see sepsis.

post-polio syndrome insidious numbness in muscles that develops 15–20 years after an attack of *poliomyelitis; the muscles may or may not have been previously affected. It may be caused by loss of nerve cells that have been under greater strain than normal as a result of the polio; there is no evidence of reactivation of the poliovirus. The syndrome also includes other symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, which may be due to secondary mechanical causes.

postprandial adj. occurring after eating.

post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) an anxiety disorder caused by a major physical or emotional trauma, such as an injury, assault, rape, or exposure to warfare or a disaster involving many casualties. The onset is at least one month after the traumatic event. The patient experiences the persistent recurrence of images or memories of the event, together with nightmares, insomnia, a sense of isolation, guilt, irritability, and loss of concentration. Emotions may be flat and depression may develop. The condition usually settles with time, but support and skilled counselling may be needed. More severe cases may be treated by *eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), *cognitive behavioural therapy, *antidepressants, and in severe cases also with *antipsychotics.

potassium n. a mineral element and an important constituent of the human body. It is the main base ion of intracellular fluid. Together with *sodium, it helps to maintain the electrical potential of the nervous system and is thus essential for the functioning of nerve and muscle. Normal blood levels are between 3.5 and 5 mmols/litre. High concentrations occur particularly in kidney failure and may lead to *arrhythmia and finally to cardiac arrest. Low values result from fluid loss, e.g. due to vomiting or diarrhoea, and this may lead to general muscle paralysis. A diet high in potassium can help to lower blood pressure; good sources are fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain cereals. Symbol: K.

potassium-channel activator any one of a class of drugs that enhance the movement of potassium ions through the *ion channels in cell membranes. In the case of smooth muscle cells, such as those in the walls of arteries, their sensitivity to the normal stimuli to contract is reduced. The result is relaxation of the muscle fibres and widening of the arteries. Potassium-channel activators are used for improving the blood supply to the heart muscle in angina pectoris. Possible side-effects include headache, flushing, vomiting, dizziness, and weakness. A currently available member of the class is nicorandil.

potassium chloride a salt of potassium used to prevent and treat potassium deficiency, especially during treatment with digoxin or anti-arrhythmic drugs. Some irritation in the digestive system may occur. Severe potassium deficiency may be treated by intravenous infusion.

power of attorney authority given by an individual to another person (a proxy) to take decisions on their behalf, either immediately or after they lose mental *capacity in relation to their financial affairs, or only after they lose capacity in relation to their personal welfare and health care. In the UK the proxy has responsibility for representing the patient’s *best interests, but he or she can refuse life-sustaining treatment for the patient only if express written provision for such a decision was made by the patient in advance (see advance directive, decision, or statement). The only circumstances in which the wishes of the proxy need not be followed is where clinicians believe that he or she is not acting in the patient’s best interests. See also advocacy; proxy decision; substituted judgment.

Prader orchidometer see orchidometer.

Prader–Willi syndrome (Prader–Willi–Labhart syndrome) a congenital condition that is inherited as an autosomal *dominant trait and is due to an abnormality of chromosome 15 (see imprinting). It is marked by pathological overeating and resulting obesity (affected children often subsequently develop type 2 diabetes), lethargy, short stature, a characteristic facial expression, learning disabilities, and underactivity of the testes or ovaries (*hypogonadism) due to lack of pituitary gonadotrophins. It is a cause of delayed puberty. [A. Prader, H. Willi, and A. Labhart (20th century), Swiss paediatricians]

precocious puberty the development at an early age of the physical and physiological changes associated with *puberty. In girls this is usually taken as development of breasts or pubic hair before the age of six or menstruation before the age of eight. In boys development of pubic hair or other adult sexual features below the age of nine is considered to be precocious. In girls 90% of cases have no underlying abnormalities, but in boys approximately half have a serious underlying cause, of which malignant testicular tumours and malignant adrenal tumours are the most common.

precordial thump a thump delivered directly to the chest wall over the heart as the first stage in treatment of a *cardiac arrest if the arrest has been witnessed (i.e. just happened) and monitored (i.e. diagnosis is immediately confirmed). The shock in that early stage can depolarize enough of the heart muscle to allow the normal *pacemaker systems within the heart to take over and restore normal cardiac output.

prefrontal lobe the region of the brain at the very front of each cerebral hemisphere (see frontal lobe). The functions of the lobe are concerned with emotions, memory, learning, and social behaviour. Nerve tracts in the lobe are cut during the operation of prefrontal *leucotomy.

pregabalin n. see gabapentin.

preganglionic adj. describing fibres in a nerve pathway that end in a ganglion, where they form synapses with *postganglionic fibres that continue the pathway to the effector organ, muscle or gland.

pre-gangrene n. the penultimate stage of vascular insufficiency before *gangrene sets in; the term is usually applied to *ischaemia of the lower limb.

pregestational diabetes Pre-existing diabetes mellitus in a woman who becomes pregnant. Pregnancy has profound effects on diabetic control and insulin requirements, which are almost doubled, and hypoglycaemia is more common. There is an increased risk of many complications, including fetal *macrosomia and *shoulder dystocia, and pre-eclampsia is twice as common in diabetic pregnancies. *Polyhydramnios and preterm labour are also more common. Even in well-controlled cases, delivery is normally indicated approximately two weeks before the estimated date due to the size of the baby and falling insulin requirements with late gestation, which can affect the uteroplacental flow.

pregnancy n. the period during which a woman carries a developing fetus, normally in the uterus (compare ectopic pregnancy). Pregnancy lasts for approximately 266 days, from *conception until the baby is born, or 280 days from the first day of the last menstrual period (see Naegele rule). During pregnancy menstruation is absent, there may be a great increase in appetite, and the breasts increase in size; the woman may also experience *morning sickness. These and other changes are brought about by a hormone (*progesterone) produced at first by the ovary and later by the *placenta. Definite evidence of pregnancy is provided by various *pregnancy tests, by the detection of the heartbeat of the fetus, and by ultrasound. Medical name: cyesis. See also pseudocyesis. —pregnant adj.

pregnancy epulis (pregnancy tumour, granuloma gravidarum) a benign growth on the gums caused by inflammation of the gingivae during pregnancy. This type of *epulis may not need any specific treatment as it often shrinks post-partum.

pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) raised blood pressure (>140/90 mmHg) developing in a woman during the second half of pregnancy. It usually resolves within six weeks of delivery and is associated with a better prognosis than *pre-eclampsia.

pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) a positive pregnancy test when no fetus can be seen on an ultrasound scan, which is due to a very early ongoing pregnancy, an early failing pregnancy, or an ectopic pregnancy not located on scan.

pregnancy test any of several methods used to demonstrate whether or not a woman is pregnant. Most pregnancy tests are based on the detection of a hormone, *human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), in the urine. The sample of urine is mixed with serum containing antibodies to hCG and marker particles (sheep red cells or latex particles) coated with hCG. In the absence of pregnancy, the antibodies will cause *agglutination of the marker particles. If the urine is from a pregnant woman, the antibodies will be absorbed and no agglutination will occur. These tests may be positive for pregnancy as early as 30 days after the date of the last normal period and are 98% accurate. Newer tests using *monoclonal antibodies (beta hCG) are more easily interpreted. When carried out on serum rather than urine, these tests give even earlier positive results.

pregnanediol n. a steroid that is formed during the metabolism of the female sex hormone *progesterone. It occurs in the urine during pregnancy and certain phases of the menstrual cycle.

pregnenolone n. a steroid synthesized in the adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes. Pregnenolone is an important intermediate product in steroid hormone synthesis and can – depending on the pathways followed – be converted to corticosteroids (glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoids), androgens, or oestrogens.

preictal phase see aura.

preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) a diagnostic procedure carried out on embryos at the earliest stage of development, before implantation in the uterus. Access to these early embryos requires the *in vitro fertilization of egg cells: three days after fertilization one or two cells are aspirated from the six-cell embryo; alternatively, tissue is removed from an embryo at five or six days, when it has reached the *blastocyst stage. Isolated cells can then be genetically analysed, allowing the transfer of selected embryos to the mother. One of the major applications of PGD is for the detection (using the *FISH technique) of chromosomal abnormalities, especially *aneuploidies (e.g. Down’s syndrome); the procedure is used mainly in women who have had repeated miscarriages or have failed to achieve pregnancy after several IVF treatment cycles, which could be due to the presence of such abnormalities in the embryo. PGD can also be used to detect defective genes responsible for hereditary disorders (e.g. the commonest form of cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease) and genes associated with susceptibility to certain cancers. When a defect is detected, *genetic counselling is offered.

premature beat see ectopic beat.

premature birth see preterm birth.

premature ejaculation persistent or recurrent emission of semen (and consequent loss of erection) with minimal stimulation before insertion of the penis into the vagina or immediately afterwards. Patients are treated with behavioural or pharmacological therapy or a combination of both.

premature ovarian failure menopause occurring before the age of 40. It may be caused by autoimmunity, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or genetic factors, for example a mutation in the FSH receptor gene causing excess secretion of gonadotrophins and small underdeveloped ovaries. Treatment is by hormone replacement, either with the contraceptive pill or HRT. *Oocyte donation should be discussed if the patient wishes for assisted conception.

premature rupture of membranes see PROM; PPROM; labour.

premedication n. drugs administered to a patient before an operation (usually one in which an anaesthetic is used). Premedication usually comprises injection of a sedative (such as a *benzodiazepine, to calm the patient down, together with a drug, such as *hyoscine, to dry up the secretions of the lungs (which might otherwise be inhaled during anaesthesia).

premenstrual syndrome (PMS) a group of symptoms experienced in varying degrees by women of reproductive age up to two weeks before menstruation. These include altered mental stability, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness, and headaches. Premenstrual symptoms that are more severe and have a substantial impact on many aspects of a woman’s life are classified in DSM-5 as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and may include more psychological symptoms (e.g. depression, extreme anxiety, and tension). Treatment for mild cases includes support, reassurance, dietary guidance, and stress reduction. More severe cases may require hormone therapy (gonadorelin analogues, combined oral contraceptives, progestogens), diuretics, and SSRIs.

premolar (bicuspid) n. either of the two teeth on each side of each jaw behind the canines and in front of the molars in the adult *dentition. There are no premolars in the primary (deciduous) dentition.

premyelocyte n. see promyelocyte.

prenatal diagnosis (antenatal diagnosis) diagnostic procedures carried out on pregnant women in order to detect the presence of genetic or other abnormalities in the developing fetus. Ultrasound scanning (see ultrasonography) remains the cornerstone of prenatal diagnosis. Other procedures include chromosome and enzyme analysis of fetal cells obtained by *amniocentesis or, at an earlier stage of pregnancy, by *chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis involves a blood test to analyse cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood. It can be performed during the first trimester and is used for fetal rhesus (Rh) determination in Rh-negative mothers, fetal sex determination in pregnancies at risk of sex-linked disorders, and for some single-sex gene disorders (e.g. achondroplasia). Compare prenatal screening.

prenatal screening *screening tests carried out to estimate the risk of chromosomal or other abnormalities being present in a developing fetus. They include blood tests to measure levels of *human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), *PAPP-A, *alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), inhibin (see activin), and *unconjugated oestriol (uE3) (see also triple test) and also ultrasound scanning for the presence of soft markers (see ultrasound marker; nuchal translucency scanning). If the results indicate a high risk of abnormalities being present, a diagnosis may be confirmed by more invasive procedures (see prenatal diagnosis).

preneoplastic adj. preceding the formation of a benign or malignant tumour (neoplasm). Preneoplastic lesions have the potential to give rise to tumours at that site. For example, mammary ductal epithelial *hyperplasia can give rise to *ductal carcinoma in situ. Preneoplastic conditions may result in tumours at that site or elsewhere. For example, ulcerative colitis predisposes to the development of colorectal *adenocarcinoma and *cholangiocarcinoma.

preoperative adj. before operation: referring to the condition of a patient or to treatment, such as sedation, given at this time.

preparedness n. (in psychology) a quality of some stimuli that makes them much more likely to trigger a pathological fear. For example, animals or high places are much more likely to become the subject of a *phobia than are plants or clothes. One theory is that individuals are genetically predisposed to *conditioning of fear to objects that have been a biological threat during human evolution.

prepatellar bursitis see housemaid’s knee.

prepubertal adj. relating to or occurring in the period before puberty.

prepuce (foreskin) n. the fold of skin that grows over the end (glans) of the penis. On its inner surface modified sebaceous glands (preputial glands) secrete a lubricating fluid over the glans. The accumulation of this secretion is known as *smegma. The foreskin is often surgically removed in infancy (see circumcision). The fold of skin that surrounds the clitoris is also called the prepuce. —preputial adj.

preputial glands modified sebaceous glands on the inner surface of the *prepuce.

preputioplasty (prepuceplasty) n. an alternative to circumcision to correct a tight foreskin (prepuce). The procedure involves a short longitudinal incision into the narrowed end of the prepuce that allows easy retraction. The inner and outer layers of the prepuce are then sutured together transversely to widen the preputial opening.

prepyramidal adj. 1. situated in the middle lobe of the cerebellum, in front of the *pyramid. 2. describing nerve fibres in tracts that descend from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, before the crossing over that occurs at the pyramid of the medulla oblongata.

presby- (presbyo-) combining form denoting old age.

presbyacusis n. the progressive sensorineural *deafness that occurs with age.

presbyopia n. difficulty in reading at the usual distance (about one foot from the eyes) and in performing other close work, due to the decline with age in the ability of the eye to alter its focus to see close objects clearly. This is caused by gradual loss of elasticity of the lens of the eye which thus becomes progressively less able to increase its curvature in order to focus on near objects.

prescribed disease one of a number of *occupational diseases for which benefits are payable. These diseases arise as a result of employment requiring close contact with a hazardous substance or circumstance. Prescribed diseases are categorized by cause: physical, biological, chemical, or other. Examples include poisoning by such chemicals as mercury or benzene, decompression sickness in divers, and infections such as *anthrax in those handling wool. Some diseases that occur widely in the population may be prescribed in relation to a specific occupation (e.g. deafness in those working with pneumatic drills or tuberculosis in mortuary attendants). See also COSHH.

prescription n. a written direction from a registered medical practitioner to a pharmacist for preparing and dispensing a drug.

presenility n. premature ageing of the mind and body, so that a person shows the reduction in mental and physical abilities normally found only in old age. See also dementia; progeria. —presenile adj.

present vb. 1. (of a patient) to come forward for examination and treatment because of experiencing specific symptoms (presenting symptoms). 2. (in obstetrics) see presentation.

presentation n. the part of the fetus that is closest to the birth canal and can be felt on inserting a finger into the vagina. Normally the back of the head (vertex) presents, the most favourable position for delivery being occipital anterior (see occiput). However, the buttocks may present (see breech presentation) or, if the fetus lies transversely across the uterus, the shoulder or arm may present (see malpresentation). These abnormal presentations may cause complications during childbirth, and attempts may be made to correct them. See also denominator.

pressor n. an agent that raises blood pressure. See vasoconstrictor.

pressure index (PI) the ratio of the pressure in the posterior tibial artery to that in the brachial artery, which reflects the degree of arterial obstruction in the artery of the lower limb.

pressure point a point at which an artery lies over a bone on which it may be compressed by finger pressure, to arrest haemorrhage beyond. For example, the femoral artery may be compressed against the pelvic bone in the groin.

pressure sore (bedsore, decubitus ulcer) an ulcerated area of skin caused by continuous pressure on part of the body: a hazard to be guarded against in all bedridden (especially unconscious) patients. Healing is hindered by the reduced blood supply to the area, and careful nursing is necessary to prevent local gangrene. The patient’s position should be changed frequently (pressure-relieving mattresses are extremely helpful), and the buttocks, heels, elbows, and other regions at risk kept dry and clean.

presymptomatic adj. describing or relating to a symptom that occurs before the typical symptoms of a disease. See also prodromal.

presystole n. the period in the cardiac cycle just preceding systole.

preterm birth (premature birth) birth of a baby before 37 weeks (259 days) of gestation (calculated from the first day of the mother’s last menstrual period); a birth at less than 23 weeks is at present incompatible with life. Such factors as *pre-eclampsia, multiple pregnancies (e.g. twins), maternal infection, and *cervical incompetence may all result in preterm births, but in the majority of cases the cause is unknown. Conditions affecting preterm babies may include *respiratory distress syndrome, feeding difficulties, inability to maintain normal body temperature, *apnoea, infection, *necrotizing enterocolitis, and brain haemorrhages. Supportive treatment is provided in an incubator in a neonatal unit; many infants survive with no residual impairment but the shorter the gestation period, the more serious are the problems to be overcome.

prevalence n. a measure of morbidity based on current levels of disease in a population, estimated either at a particular time (point prevalence) or over a stated period (period prevalence). It can be expressed either in terms of affected people (persons) or episodes of sickness per 1000 individuals at risk. Compare incidence rate.

preventive dentistry the branch of dentistry concerned with the prevention of dental disease and the promotion and maintenance of oral health. It includes dietary counselling, advice on oral hygiene, and the application of *fluoride and *fissure sealants to the teeth.

preventive medicine the branch of medicine whose main aim is the prevention of disease. This is a wide field, in which workers tackle problems ranging from the immunization of persons against infectious diseases, such as diphtheria or whooping cough, to finding methods of eliminating *vectors, such as malaria-carrying mosquitoes. See primary prevention; secondary prevention; tertiary prevention. See also World Health Organization.

preventive resin restoration a hybrid between a *fissure sealant and a conventional *filling that is used to treat early dental caries involving dentine.

priapism n. a prolonged (greater than four hours) and usually painful erection of the penis. Ischaemic priapism is associated with blood disorders (such as sickle-cell disease or leukaemia) or haemodialysis or it can result from administration of drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction, such as *papaverine or intracorporeal *alprostadil. It requires urgent decompression by draining the blood from the corpora cavernosa of the penis with a 19 SWG butterfly needle and instilling a *vasoconstrictor (e.g. phenylephrine). If aspiration fails surgical shunts may be necessary. An unrelieved ischaemic priapism results in eventual complete fibrosis of the spongy tissue of the corpora and no further erections are possible. A penile *prosthesis may be appropriate in this situation. Nonischaemic priapism is usually caused by perineal trauma resulting in an arteriovenous *fistula. This does not result in tissue damage. *Embolization of the site of vascular injury is usually necessary.

prickle cells cells with cytoplasmic processes that form intercellular bridges. The germinative layer of the *epidermis is sometimes called the prickle cell layer.

prickly heat an itchy rash of small raised red spots. It occurs usually on the face, neck, back, chest, and thighs. Infants and obese people are susceptible to prickly heat, which is most common in hot moist weather. It is caused by blockage of the sweat ducts and the only treatment is removal of the patient to a cool (air-conditioned) place. Medical name: miliaria rubra.

prilocaine n. a local *anaesthetic used particularly in dentistry. High doses of the drug may cause methaemoglobinaemia and cyanosis. Prilocaine is also a constituent of *EMLA cream.

prima facie a principle that, at first sight, must be conformed with unless it conflicts with an equally important principle. Because each of the *four principles in medical ethics is prima facie, no one of them has overriding priority.

primaquine n. a drug used in the treatment of benign *malarias. It is administered after treatment with *chloroquine. High doses may cause blood disorders (such as methaemoglobinaemia or haemolytic anaemia) and digestive upsets.

primary care health care provided by *general practitioners or other health professionals to whom patients seeking medical treatment have direct access and to whom they can usually self-refer. Primary care services provided by the NHS include general practices, general dental and ophthalmic services, together with *NHS walk-in centres and other community services outside the hospital service. Some primary care services are also available in the private sector. See also community health; domiciliary services; general dental services; health centre; NHS 111. Compare secondary care; tertiary care.

primary care trust (PCT) formerly, one of a group of free-standing statutory bodies within the National Health Service that had responsibility for the health-care needs of their local community; their aim was to improve the health of and address *health inequalities in their communities. In 2013, PCTs and SHAs were abolished. Their commissioning responsibilities passed to *clinical commissioning groups and *NHS England; their public health responsibilities passed to local authorities and *Public Health England.

primary prevention avoidance of the onset of disease by behaviour modification or treatment. For example, limiting alcohol intake reduces the risk of developing cirrhosis, and routine childhood *immunization prevents the development of infections of childhood. See also preventive medicine; secondary prevention; tertiary prevention.

primary teeth (deciduous teeth, milk teeth) the first set of teeth, which develop in infancy. These teeth are normally shed just before the eruption of their permanent successors. In the absence of permanent successors they can remain functional for many years. See dentition.

primitive streak the region of the embryo that proliferates rapidly, producing mesoderm cells that spread outwards between the layers of ectoderm and endoderm.

primordial adj. (in embryology) describing cells or tissues that are formed in the early stages of embryonic development.

primum non nocere Latin for ‘first do no harm’, a traditional medical aphorism, similar to the Greek for ‘abstain from doing harm’ in the Hippocratic Oath and also to the *prima facie principle of *nonmaleficence. It is a reminder to first consider whether a proposed medical intervention risks causing more harm than good. See also risk–benefit analysis.

P–R interval the interval on an *electrocardiogram between the onset of atrial activity and ventricular activity. It represents the time required for the impulse from the *sinoatrial node to reach the ventricles.

prion n. an abnormal form of a constituent protein (PrP) of brain cells. The abnormal proteins are very stable: they are not removed by the normal cellular processes of degradation and are resistant to radiation and sterilization (therefore surgical instruments need first to undergo *decontamination). They are believed to interact with normal PrP in such a way as to convert it to the abnormal form, which accumulates in the brain. Prions are now widely accepted as being the causal agents of a range of serious diseases including *Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, *Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker syndrome, and *kuru, all of which are *spongiform encephalopathies. Different mutations in the PrP gene are believed to be responsible for the different forms of these so-called prion disorders.

privacy n. the condition of being apart from public view. The law recognizes privacy as a *human right by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998, although there are occasions when this right may be overridden (for example, in legal proceedings). In medical ethics, the concept is associated with maintaining a patient’s dignity and *autonomy and with the doctor’s duty of *confidentiality.

PRK photorefractive keratectomy (see keratectomy).

pro- prefix denoting 1. before; preceding. 2. a precursor. 3. in front of.

process n. 1. (in anatomy) a thin prominence or protuberance; for example, any of the processes of a vertebra. 2. the steps by which a decision is reached or an outcome attained. Although good medical practice is largely recognized by its good outcomes, the process by which these outcomes were reached is also seen as important in assessing the standard of care.

prochlorperazine n. a phenothiazine *antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia and other psychoses and severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Possible side-effects include drowsiness and dry mouth, and high doses may cause tremors and abnormal muscle movements.

procidentia n. the complete downward displacement (*prolapse) of an organ, especially the uterus (uterine procidentia), which protrudes from the vaginal opening. Uterine procidentia may result from injury to the floor of the pelvic cavity, invariably the result of childbirth.

proct- (procto-) combining form denoting the anus and/or rectum.

proctalgia (proctodynia) n. pain in the rectum or anus. In proctalgia fugax sudden severe pain affects the rectum and may last for seconds to minutes; the pain resolves fully with no ongoing symptoms, and attacks may be days or months apart. There is no structural disease and the pain is probably due to muscle spasm (see irritable bowel syndrome). Relief is sometimes obtained from a bowel action, inserting a finger into the rectum, or from a hot bath. It may be prevented by measures used in treating the irritable bowel syndrome.

proctatresia n. see imperforate anus.

proctectasia n. enlargement or widening of the rectum, usually due to long-standing constipation (see dyschezia).

Proctitis is invariably present in *ulcerative colitis and sometimes in *Crohn’s disease and a sexually transmitted infection (particularly in those who practise anal intercourse). Rarer causes include damage by irradiation (radiation proctitis), or after a colostomy has rendered the rectum nonfunctional (diversion proctitis).

proctocele n. see rectocele.

proctocolectomy n. a surgical operation in which the rectum and colon are removed. In panproctocolectomy the entire rectum and colon are removed, necessitating either a permanent opening of the ileum (see ileostomy) or the construction of an *ileal pouch. This is usually performed for *ulcerative colitis.

proctocolitis n. inflammation of the rectum and colon, usually due to *ulcerative colitis. See also proctitis.

proctodeum n. the site of the embryonic anus, marked by a depression lined with ectoderm. The membrane separating it from the hindgut breaks down in the third month of gestation. Compare stomodeum.

proctodynia n. see proctalgia.

prodrome n. a symptom indicating the onset of a disease.

prodrug n. a drug that requires metabolism in the liver before becoming biologically active. Examples are *carbimazole, which is metabolized to the pharmacologically active compound methimazole; and *capecitabine, which is metabolized to *fluorouracil.

proenzyme (zymogen) n. the inactive form in which certain enzymes (e.g. digestive enzymes) are originally produced and secreted. The existence of this inactive form prevents the enzyme from breaking down the cells in which it was made. Once the proenzyme has been secreted it is converted to the active form.

proerythroblast n. the earliest recognizable precursor of the red blood cell (erythrocyte). It is found in the bone marrow and has a large nucleus and a cytoplasm that stains deep blue with *Romanowsky stains. See also erythroblast; erythropoiesis.

professionalism n. possession of a high level of intellectual and technical expertise with a commitment to public service and the ability to practise autonomously within the regulations of the discipline. It calls for a special set of *values, behaviours, and relationships including respect and care for oneself as well as patients and others, honesty, *integrity, reliability, *responsibility, communication, collaboration, *compassion, *empathy, altruism, and *advocacy – but also self-awareness and a knowledge of limits (see burnout). Major shortcomings might be reported to a professional body (such as the *General Medical Council for UK doctors).

profilometer n. a measuring device to quantify the roughness of a surface, such as eroded enamel.

profunda adj. describing blood vessels that are deeply embedded in the tissues they supply.

profundaplasty n. surgical enlargement of the junction of the femoral artery and its deep branch, a common operation to relieve narrowing by atherosclerosis at this point.

progeria n. a very rare condition in which all the signs of old age appear and progress in a child, so that ‘senility’ is reached before puberty.

progesterone n. a steroid hormone secreted by the *corpus luteum of the ovary, the placenta, and also (in small amounts) by the adrenal cortex and testes. It is responsible for preparing the inner lining (endometrium) of the uterus for pregnancy. If fertilization occurs it maintains the uterus throughout pregnancy and prevents the further release of eggs from the ovary. See also menstrual cycle; progestogen.

progestogen n. one of a group of naturally occurring or synthetic steroid hormones, including *progesterone, that maintain the normal course of pregnancy. Progestogens are used to treat premenstrual tension, *amenorrhoea, and abnormal bleeding from the uterus. Because they prevent ovulation, progestogens are a major constituent of *oral contraceptives and other forms of hormonal *contraception. Synthetic progestogens may be taken by mouth but the naturally occurring hormone must be given by intramuscular injection or subcutaneous implant, as it is rapidly broken down in the liver.

proglottis n. (pl. proglottids or proglottides) one of the segments of a *tapeworm. Mature segments, situated at the posterior end of the worm, each consist mainly of a branched uterus packed with eggs.

prognathism n. abnormal protrusion of one or both jaws. —prognathic adj.

prognosis n. an assessment of the future course and outcome of a patient’s disease, based on knowledge of the course of the disease in other patients together with the general health, age, and sex of the patient.

progressive lenses see varifocal lenses.

progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome) a progressive neurological disorder resulting from degeneration of the motor neurons, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Starting in late middle age, it is characterized by a staring facial expression due to impaired ability to move the eyes up and down, progressing to difficulties in swallowing, speech, balance, and movement and general spasticity. The condition enters the differential diagnosis of *parkinsonism, with which it is often confused in its early stages.

proguanil n. a drug that kills malaria parasites and is used in combination with atovaquone for the prevention and treatment of malignant (falciparum) *malaria. Alone or (more usually) in combination with *chloroquine, it may be used for the prevention of malaria. It rarely causes side-effects.

proinsulin n. a substance produced in the pancreas from which the hormone *insulin is derived.

projection n. (in psychology) the attribution of one’s own qualities to other people. In psychoanalysis this is considered to be one of the *defence mechanisms; people who cannot tolerate their own feelings (e.g. anger) may cope by imagining that other people have those feelings (e.g. are angry).

projective test (in psychology) a way of measuring aspects of personality, in which the subject is asked to talk freely about ambiguous objects. His responses are then analysed. Examples are the *Rorschach test and the Thematic Apperception Test (in which the subject invents stories about a set of pictures).

prokinetic agent (prokinetic) an agent (e.g. *domperidone) that stimulates intestinal peristalsis, thus increasing gastrointestinal motility.

prolactin (lactogenic hormone, luteotrophic hormone, luteotrophin) n. a hormone, synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, that stimulates milk production after childbirth and also stimulates production of *progesterone by the *corpus luteum in the ovary. Excessive secretion of prolactin, resulting in raised serum levels of the hormone (hyperprolactinaemia), is usually due to the presence of a pituitary adenoma (see prolactinoma); other causes include *dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. antipsychotic drugs) and chronic renal failure.

prolactinoma n. a benign tumour (an *adenoma) of the pituitary gland that secretes excessive amounts of prolactin. Symptoms include loss of sexual drive, amenorrhoea or impotence, and sometimes production of breast milk in men and women. If the tumour is large enough it may compress and damage adjacent structures. Treatment is with dopamine receptor agonist drugs, such as *bromocriptine, as dopamine inhibits prolactin production and may also shrink and harden the tumour, facilitating later surgical removal.

prolapse n. downward displacement of an organ or tissue from its normal position, usually the result of weakening of the supporting tissues. Prolapse of the uterus and/or vagina is, in most cases, caused by stretching and/or tearing of the supporting tissues during childbirth. The cervix may be visible at the vaginal opening or the uterus and vagina may be completely outside the opening (procidentia). Treatment is by surgical shortening of the supporting ligaments and narrowing of the vagina and vaginal orifice (see colporrhaphy; colpoperineorrhaphy) or by surgical removal of the uterus (vaginal *hysterectomy). In a rectal prolapse, the rectum descends to lie outside the anus; it is surgically treated (see rectopexy).

prolapsed intervertebral disc (PID) a ‘slipped disc’: protrusion of the pulpy inner material of an *intervertebral disc through a tear in the fibrous outer coat, causing pressure on adjoining nerve roots, ligaments, etc. The condition often results from sudden twisting or bending of the backbone or lifting. Pressure on the sciatic nerve root causes *sciatica, and if severe may damage the nerve’s function, leading to abnormalities or loss of sensation, muscle weakness, or loss of tendon reflexes. 70–80% of patients improve with conservative treatment of rest and analgesics, and traction may help. If these fail, the protruding portion of the disc is surgically removed (see discectomy; laminectomy; microdiscectomy).

proline n. an *amino acid found in many proteins.

PROM prelabour (or premature) rupture of membranes: spontaneous rupture of membranes prior to the onset of labour. The majority of women who demonstrate this phenomenon will go into active labour spontaneously within the following 48 hours. Compare PPROM.

promazine n. a phenothiazine *antipsychotic drug used to relieve agitation, confusion, and restlessness. Common side-effects are drowsiness and dizziness.

promegakaryocyte n. an immature cell, found in the bone marrow, that develops into a *megakaryocyte.

promethazine n. a powerful *antihistamine drug used to treat allergic conditions and – because of its sedative action – insomnia; it is also used as a premedication and an *antiemetic. Side-effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and confusion.

prominence n. (in anatomy) a projection, such as a projection on a bone.

promontory n. (in anatomy) a projecting part of an organ or other structure.

promoter (in oncogenesis) n. a substance that, in conjunction with an *initiator, leads to the production of a cancer.

prompting n. a technique used in *behaviour modification to elicit a response not previously present. The subject is made to engage passively in the required behaviour by instructions or by being physically put through the movements. The behaviour can then be rewarded (see reinforcement). This is followed by fading, in which the prompting is gradually withdrawn and the reinforcement maintained.

promyelocyte (premyelocyte) n. the developmental stage of a *granulocyte (a type of white blood cell) between the *myeloblast and the *myelocyte. It has abundant cytoplasm that, with *Romanowsky stains, appears blue with reddish granules. Promyelocytes are normally found in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow but may appear in the blood in a variety of diseases. See also granulopoiesis.

pronation n. the act of turning the hand so that the palm faces downwards. In this position the bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) are crossed. Compare supination.

pronator n. any muscle that causes pronation of the forearm and hand; for example, the pronator teres, a two-headed muscle arising from the humerus and ulna, close to the elbow, and inserted into the radius.

prone adj. 1. lying with the face downwards. 2. (of the forearm) in the position in which the palm of the hand faces downwards (see pronation). Compare supine.

propantheline n. an *antimuscarinic drug that decreases activity of smooth muscle (see antispasmodic) and is used to treat disorders of the digestive system and (in adults) *enuresis. Side-effects include dry mouth and blurred vision.

properdin n. a group of substances in blood plasma that, in combination with *complement and magnesium ions, is capable of destroying certain bacteria and viruses. The properdin complex occurs naturally, rather than as the result of previous exposure to microorganisms, and its activity is not directed against any particular species. Compare antibody.

prophase n. the first stage of *mitosis and of each division of *meiosis, in which the chromosomes become visible under the microscope. The first prophase of meiosis occurs in five stages (see leptotene; zygotene; pachytene; diplotene; diakinesis).

prophylactic n. an agent that prevents the development of a condition or disease. Examples are *glyceryl trinitrate, which is used to prevent attacks of angina, and allopurinol, used to prevent gout attacks.

prophylaxis n. any means taken to prevent disease, such as immunization against diphtheria or whooping cough, or *fluoridation to prevent dental decay in children. —prophylactic adj.

Common side-effects include digestive upsets, sleep disturbances, lassitude, and coldness of extremities.

proprietary name (in pharmacy) the trade name of a drug: the name assigned to it by the firm that manufactured it. For example, Taxotere and Herceptin are the proprietary names of docetaxel and trastuzumab, respectively.

proprioceptor n. a specialized sensory nerve ending (see receptor) that monitors internal changes in the body brought about by movement and muscular activity. Proprioceptors located in muscles and tendons transmit information that is used to coordinate muscular activity (see stretch receptor; tendon organ). See also mechanoreceptor.

prospective study 1. a forward-looking review of a group of individuals in relation to morbidity. 2. see cohort study.

prostacyclin n. a derivative of *prostaglandin H produced by the endothelium lining blood vessel walls. It inhibits blood clotting by preventing platelet aggregation and causes vasodilatation (compare thromboxane A2). *Epoprostenol is a pharmaceutical preparation of prostacyclin.

prostaglandin n. one of a group of hormone-like substances present in a wide variety of tissues and body fluids (including the uterus, brain, lungs, kidney, and semen). Prostaglandins have many actions; for example, they cause contraction of smooth muscle (including that of the uterus), dilation of blood vessels, and are mediators in the process of inflammation (aspirin and other *NSAIDs act by blocking their production). They are also involved in the production of mucus in the stomach, which provides protection against acid gastric juice; use of NSAIDs reduces this effect and predisposes to peptic ulceration, the principal side-effect of these drugs. There are nine classes of prostaglandins (PGA–I), within which individual prostaglandins are denoted by numerals (e.g. PGE1). Synthetic prostaglandins are used to induce labour or produce abortion (see dinoprostone; gemeprost) and to treat peptic ulcers (see misoprostol), congenital heart disease in newborn babies (see alprostadil), and glaucoma (see latanoprost).

prostate cancer a malignant tumour (*carcinoma) of the prostate gland, a common form of cancer in elderly men. In most men it progresses slowly over many years and gives symptoms similar to those of benign enlargement of the prostate (see prostate gland). Before it was possible to test for *prostate specific antigen (PSA), the tumour had often invaded locally, spread to regional lymph nodes, and metastasized to bone before clinical presentation. By checking elevated levels of PSA or *PCA3, prostate cancer can be detected 5–10 years before the tumour would present symptomatically. If the disease is confined to the prostate, the patient may be offered active surveillance or radical *prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, or *brachytherapy; *cryotherapy or *HIFU are available in specialized centres. In elderly patients, it may be enough to monitor the tumour growth. If the disease is outside the prostate, androgen deprivation therapy may be used; this may be achieved by *gonadorelin analogues, *anti-androgens, surgical castration, or oestrogen therapy.

prostatectomy n. surgical removal of the prostate gland. The operation is necessary to relieve retention of urine due to enlargement of the prostate or to reduce *lower urinary tract symptoms thought to be due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland). The operation can be performed through the bladder (transvesical prostatectomy) or through the surrounding capsule of the prostate (retropubic prostatectomy). In the operation of transurethral prostatectomy (or transurethral resection) some or all the obstructing prostate can be removed through the urethra using a resectoscope (see resection).

Radical (or total) prostatectomy is undertaken for the treatment of prostate cancer that is confined to the gland. It entails removal of the prostate together with its capsule and the seminal vesicles. Continuity of the urinary tract is achieved by anastomosing the bladder to the divided urethra. Radical prostatectomy may be performed by laparoscopy, increasingly with the aid of a robot (robotic prostatectomy): the three-armed da Vinci robot can be operated by the surgeon via a console and provides three-dimensional displays of the operation site and surrounding structures.

prostate gland a male accessory sex gland that opens into the urethra just below the bladder and vas deferens (see illustration). The prostate is divided into different anatomical regions called McNeal’s zones (transition, central, peripheral, and anterior fibromuscular zones). During ejaculation it secretes an alkaline fluid that forms part of the *semen. The prostate may become enlarged in elderly men (benign prostatic hyperplasia; BPH). This may result in obstruction of the neck of the bladder, impairing urination. The bladder dilates and the increased pressure is transmitted through the ureters to the kidney nephrons, leading to damage and impaired function of the kidneys. Treatment is by transurethral *resection of the prostate (see also prostatectomy) or by means of drugs (e.g. *finasteride, alpha blockers).

The prostate gland and associated structures (median view).





prostate specific antigen (PSA) a protease enzyme produced by the glandular epithelium of the prostate. Its effect is to liquefy the semen within the ejaculate. Overall PSA has a half-life of 2–3 days. Increased quantities are secreted when the gland becomes enlarged or inflamed, and levels of PSA in the blood are significantly elevated in cancer of the prostate. Although there is no clear ‘cut-off’ level for normality, over 4 ng/ml in the blood is associated with a 20% risk of prostate cancer, even in patients with normal-feeling prostates on rectal examination. Age-specific PSA reference ranges are often used. Newer PSA assays can measure free PSA and compare it to the total PSA in the blood. Low free:total PSA ratios indicate a greater risk of prostate cancer and improve the discrimination between cancer and benign disease in men with a PSA in the range 4–10 ng/ml. PSA levels tend to be much higher in advanced prostate cancer and the rate of fall on treatment (e.g. after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) is a good prognostic indicator of response.

prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) abnormal cells in the prostate that are not cancer, but may be associated with cancer within the prostate. Typically, PIN will be found in prostate biopsies taken because levels of *prostate specific antigen are elevated. Multifocal high-grade PIN (HGPIN) on a prostate biopsy may indicate that another set of prostate biopsies should be taken in the future.

prostatism n. see lower urinary tract symptoms.

prostatitis n. inflammation of the prostate gland. This may be due to bacterial infection and can be either acute or chronic. In acute prostatitis the patient has all the symptoms of a urinary infection, including pain in the perineal area, temperature, and shivering. Treatment is by antibiotic administration. In chronic prostatitis, patients commonly complain of pain in the area between the scrotum and the anus, accompanied by *lower urinary tract symptoms. Some of these cases are due to bacterial infection, in which case antibiotics are required. In others, no bacterial infection is demonstrated, although there may be evidence of inflammation. Treatment in these cases involves alpha blockers, anti-inflammatory agents, and occasionally antibiotics. In some men, vigorous prostate massage performed under a general anaesthetic can significantly alleviate symptoms.

prostatorrhoea n. an abnormal discharge of fluid from the prostate gland. This occurs in some patients with acute *prostatitis, who complain of a profuse discharge from the urethra. The discharge is usually thin and watery and is often sterile on culture. The discharge usually subsides when the underlying prostatitis is controlled.

prosthesis n. (pl. prostheses) any artificial device that is attached to the body as an aid. Prostheses include bridges, dentures, artificial parts of the face, artificial limbs, hearing aids and cochlear implants, implanted pacemakers, and many other substitutes for parts of the body that are missing or nonfunctional. Penile prostheses are malleable, semirigid, or inflatable rods inserted into the corpora cavernosa of the penis to produce rigidity sufficient for vaginal penetration in men with erectile dysfunction. —prosthetic adj.

prosthodontics (prosthetic dentistry) n. the branch of dentistry concerned with the provision of *dentures, *bridges, and *implant-retained prostheses.

protease n. any enzyme that catalyses the splitting of a protein. See also proteolytic enzyme.

protease inhibitor any one of a class of drugs used in the treatment of HIV infection and *AIDS. Used in combination with other *antiretroviral drugs, they act by inhibiting the action of protease, an enzyme produced by HIV that cleaves two precursor proteins into smaller fragments. These fragments are required for viral growth, infectivity, and replication. Protease inhibitors include atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir and ritonavir (which are used in combination), saquinavir, and tipranavir. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and rashes; these drugs are also associated with hyperglycaemia and *lipodystrophy. See also boceprevir.

proteasome n. a multi-enzyme complex in cells that breaks down proteins into short peptides.

protein n. one of a group of organic compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (sulphur and phosphorus may also be present). The protein molecule is a complex structure made up of one or more chains of *amino acids, which are linked by peptide bonds. Proteins are essential constituents of the body; they form the structural material of muscles, tissues, organs, etc., and are equally important as regulators of function, as enzymes and hormones. Proteins are synthesized in the body from their constituent amino acids, which are obtained from the digestion of protein in the diet. Excess protein, not required by the body, can be converted into glucose and used as an energy source (*gluconeogenesis).

protein kinase an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a specific amino acid residue of an intracellular protein (usually serine, threonine, or tyrosine), thereby affecting the biological activity of the protein. Protein kinase inhibitors are drugs that block the action of protein kinases in tumour cells and are used in the treatment of cancer. They include *sorafenib, *sunitinib, and *temsirolimus. See also tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

proteinuria n. the presence of protein in the urine. This may indicate the presence of damage to, or disease of, the kidneys. See also albuminuria.

proteolysis n. the process whereby complex protein molecules, obtained from the diet, are broken down by digestive enzymes in the stomach and small intestine into their constituent amino acids, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. See endopeptidase; exopeptidase. —proteolytic adj.

proteolytic enzyme a digestive enzyme that causes the breakdown of protein. See endopeptidase; exopeptidase.

proteose n. a product of the hydrolytic decomposition of protein.

Proteus n. a genus of rodlike Gram-negative flagellate highly motile bacteria common in the intestines and in decaying organic material. All species can decompose urea. Some species may cause disease in humans: P. vulgaris can cause urinary tract infections.

prothrombin time (PT) the time taken for blood clotting to occur in a sample of blood to which calcium and thromboplastin have been added. A prolonged PT (compared with a control sample) indicates a deficiency of *coagulation factors, which – with calcium and thromboplastin – are required for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin to occur in the final stages of blood coagulation. Measurement of PT is used to control anticoagulant therapy (e.g. with warfarin). See INR.

proto- combining form denoting 1. first. 2. primitive; early. 3. a precursor.

protodiastole n. the short period in the cardiac cycle between the end of systole and the closure of the *aortic valve marking the start of diastole.

proton pump the enzyme system in the *parietal cells of the stomach that stimulates acid secretion into the stomach by exchanging hydrogen ions for potassium ions. See proton-pump inhibitor.

proton-pump inhibitor a drug that reduces gastric acid secretion by blocking the *proton pump. Proton-pump inhibitors include esomeprazole, lansoprazole, *omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole sodium; they are used for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, and acid hypersecretion associated with *gastrinoma.

proton therapy a type of radiotherapy that uses a beam of protons. These charged particles are produced by a *cyclotron and penetrate only a predictable distance into the body depending on the proton energy. This is the radiotherapy treatment of choice for many childhood cancers, particularly brain and spinal tumours, as it can avoid more normal tissue and reduce the risk of long-term complications (including secondary malignancy) compared with photon (X-ray) beams.

proto-oncogene n. a gene in a normal cell that is of identical structure to certain viral genes. Some are important regulators of cell division and damage may change them into *oncogenes.

Prozac n. see fluoxetine.

PRRT see peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

prune belly syndrome (Eagle–Barrett syndrome) a hereditary condition, occurring exclusively in males, characterized by a deficiency of abdominal muscles, complex malformation of the urinary tract, and bilateral undescended testes. The lungs may be underdeveloped. The name derives from the typically wrinkled appearance of the skin over the abdomen.

prurigo n. an intensely itchy eruption of small papules. Besnier’s prurigo is a type of chronic atopic *eczema that is lichenified (see lichenification). Nodular prurigo is a condition of unknown cause, although it is usually found in atopic individuals (see atopy). Very severe itching characterizes these nodules, which mostly occur on the distal limbs. Prurigo of pregnancy occurs in 1 in 300 women in the middle trimester of pregnancy, affecting mainly the abdomen and the extensor surfaces of the limbs. It may recur in later pregnancies. It is linked to abnormal blood hormone levels, particularly elevated levels of gonadotrophins and lower levels of cortisol and oestrogen. Pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy is a similar pruritic eruption, predominantly on the trunk and thighs, consisting of follicular papules and pustules. It usually presents in the latter half of pregnancy and resolves early after delivery.

pruritus n. itching. Mediated by histamine and other vasoactive chemicals, it is the predominant symptom of atopic *eczema, *lichen planus, and many other skin diseases. It also occurs in the elderly and may be a manifestation of psychological illness or infection (such as scabies). Perineal itching is common: itching of the vulva in women is termed pruritus vulvae; itching of the perianal region (pruritus ani) is more common in men. Causes of perineal itching include poor hygiene, *candidiasis, *threadworms, and itchy skin diseases (such as eczema). Pruritus also occurs as a symptom of dry skin and of certain systemic disorders, such as chronic renal failure, *cholestasis, and iron deficiency. Pruritus gravidarum is generalized itching during pregnancy that starts in the first trimester. It is associated with *obstetric cholestasis and requires monitoring of liver function and bile acids, high levels of which endanger the fetus. Other conditions marked by pregnancy-related pruritus include *polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, *prurigo of pregnancy, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy, and *pemphigoid gestationalis; all of these are associated with a rash. Treatment of pruritus is determined by the cause.

prussic acid see hydrocyanic acid.

PSA see prostate specific antigen.

psammoma n. a tumour containing gritty sandlike particles (psammoma bodies). It is typical of cancer of the ovary but may also be found in the meninges (the membranes surrounding the brain).

pseud- (pseudo-) combining form denoting superficial resemblance to; false.

pseudarthrosis (nearthrosis) n. a ‘false’ joint. Congenital pseudarthrosis occurs in childhood, when an apparent fracture in the tibia or clavicle is followed by non-*union. A pseudarthrosis can form in adulthood when a fracture fails to unite and the bone ends are separated by fibrous tissue, which allows some movement across the fracture site.

pseudoagglutination n. the misleading appearance of clumping that occurs during an antiserum-antigen test as a result of incorrect temperature or acidity of the solutions used.

pseudoaneurysm n. see aneurysm.

pseudocholinesterase n. an enzyme found in the blood and other tissues that – like *cholinesterase – breaks down acetylcholine, but much more slowly. Not being localized at nerve endings, it plays little part in the normal breakdown of acetylcholine in synapses and at neuromuscular junctions.

pseudocoxalgia n. see Legg–Calveˊ–Perthes disease.

pseudocrisis n. a false *crisis: a sudden but temporary change in a condition, such as a fall of temperature in a patient with fever.

pseudocryptorchidism n. apparent absence of the testes. This is quite common in young boys, who retract their testes into the groin due to involuntary or reflex contraction of the cremasteric muscle of the suspensory cord (also known as retractile testes). The condition is only important in that it needs to be distinguished from true failure of descent of the testes into the scrotum, which requires early surgical treatment (see cryptorchidism).

pseudocyesis (phantom pregnancy, false pregnancy) n. a condition in which a nonpregnant woman exhibits symptoms of pregnancy, e.g. enlarged abdomen, increased weight, morning sickness, and absence of menstruation. The condition usually has an emotional basis.

pseudocyst n. a fluid-filled space within an organ that is not enclosed by an epithelial lining. A pancreatic pseudocyst may develop in cases of chronic pancreatitis or as a complication of acute pancreatitis. As the pseudocyst expands it may cause abdominal pain accompanied by a rise in the level of pancreatic enzymes in the blood. It may be felt by abdominal examination or identified by radiological imaging. Treatment is by endoscopic or radiological drainage or by surgery (see marsupialization).

pseudodementia n. a condition in which symptoms of *dementia, including memory disorders, are caused by depression rather than organic brain disease. It is most commonly seen in elderly depressed individuals.

pseudoexfoliation syndrome the appearance of white dandruff-like deposits on structures in the anterior chamber of the eye, which are especially prominent around the pupil margin and on the anterior lens capsule. It is a sign of zonular weakness and indicates an increased risk of secondary glaucoma.

pseudogout n. joint pain and swelling, resembling gout, caused by crystals of calcium pyrophosphate in the synovial membrane and fluid (see synovitis). It commonly affects the knee. X-rays may show signs of *chondrocalcinosis. Treatments include NSAIDs and colchicine. Pseudogout is one manifestation of *calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.

pseudohallucination n. a controversial term, commonly used in *mental state examinations, for an experience described by the patient as a *hallucination but judged by the psychiatrist as not perceived as such by the patient. It may sometimes be seen as an attempt by patients to pretend that they suffer from genuine hallucinations. The term is generally unhelpful because it implies a value judgment.

pseudohermaphroditism n. a former term for an individual who is genetically male (XY) or female (XX) and has normal internal sex organs but whose external genitalia resemble those of the opposite sex. The term is now considered offensive. See intersex.

pseudohypertrophy n. increase in the size of an organ or structure caused by excessive growth of cells that have a packing or supporting role but do not contribute directly to its functioning. The result is usually a decline in the efficiency of the organ although it becomes larger. —pseudohypertrophic adj.

pseudohypoparathyroidism n. a syndrome of learning disability, restricted growth, and bony abnormalities due to a genetic defect that causes lack of response to the hormone secreted by the *parathyroid glands. Treatment with calcium and vitamin D can reverse most of the features. See also Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy.

pseudomembrane n. a false membrane, consisting of a layer of exudate on the surface of the skin or a mucous membrane. In diphtheria a pseudomembrane forms in the throat. In pseudomembranous colitis, a disease caused by *Clostridium difficile that usually follows antibiotic therapy, pseudomembranes develop in the colon, resulting in profuse diarrhoea.

pseudomembranous colitis see Clostridium; pseudomembrane.

Pseudomonas n. a genus of rodlike motile pigmented Gram-negative bacteria. Most live in soil and decomposing organic matter; they are involved in recycling nitrogen, converting nitrates to ammonia or free nitrogen. The species P. aeruginosa is pathogenic to humans, occurring in pus from wounds; it is associated with urinary tract infections. P. pseudomallei is the causative agent of *melioidosis.

pseudomyxoma n. a mucoid tumour of the peritoneum, often seen in association with *myxomas of the ovary. In pseudomyxoma peritonei there are recurrent deposits of mucin-producing cells in the abdomen, which can be difficult to clear by surgery and may prove fatal.

pseudoneuritis n. a condition that resembles *retrobulbar neuritis but is not due to inflammation. The most usual cause is blockage of blood vessels in the optic nerve (ischaemic optic neuropathy).

pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie’s syndrome) n. functional impairment of intestinal peristalsis without evidence of an obstructing lesion (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction). It presents with vomiting, marked abdominal distension, and constipation. It commonly occurs in hospitalized patients with serious illness, probably caused by abnormalities in colonic autonomic regulation and often associated with trauma, sepsis, the postoperative state following abdominal, pelvic, or orthopaedic surgery, or cardiac dysfunction (heart failure, myocardial infarction). Management is usually conservative and involves treatment of the underlying condition, the ‘drip and suck’ approach (see ileus), decompression of the colon, and prokinetic agents (such as neostigmine). Surgery is required when the conservative approach fails or in cases of perforation.

pseudophakia n. the state of the eye after the natural lens has been replaced by a synthetic lens implanted inside the eye, approximately in the position previously occupied by the natural lens. This is the current form of surgery for *cataract. —pseudophakic adj.

pseudopodium n. (pl. pseudopodia) a temporary and constantly changing extension of the body of an amoeba or an amoeboid cell (see phagocyte). Pseudopodia engulf bacteria and other particles as food and are responsible for the movements of the cell.

pseudopolyposis n. a condition in which the bowel lining (mucosa) is covered by elevated or protuberant plaques (pseudopolyps) that are not true *polyps but abnormal growths of inflamed mucosa. It is usually found in patients with longstanding *ulcerative colitis during endoscopy or barium enema examination.

pseudoprolactinoma n. a mass in the pituitary gland region that is associated with a raised blood prolactin level due to interference of the pituitary stalk (through which the chemical dopamine, the inhibitor of prolactin release, passes from the hypothalamus) rather than to increased prolactin production from a pituitary *prolactinoma.

pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism n. a condition in which all the symptoms of *pseudohypoparathyroidism are present but the patient’s response to parathyroid hormone is normal. It is often found in families affected with pseudohypoparathyroidism.

pseudo seizure see non-epileptic seizure.

pseudotumour cerebri see idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

pseudoxanthoma elasticum a hereditary disease in which elastic fibres (see elastic tissue) become calcified. The skin becomes lax and yellowish papules develop in affected areas; this is accompanied by degenerative changes in the blood vessels and *angioid streaks in the retina.

psilosis n. see sprue.

psittacosis (parrot disease, ornithosis) n. an endemic infection of birds, especially parrots, budgerigars, canaries, finches, pigeons, and poultry, caused by a small intracellular bacterium, Chlamydia psittaci. The birds are often asymptomatic carriers. The infection is transmitted to humans by inhalation from handling the birds or by contact with feathers, faeces, or cage dust, but person-to-person transmission also occurs. The symptoms include fever, dry cough, severe muscle pain, and headache; occasionally a severe generalized systemic illness results. The condition responds to tetracycline or erythromycin.

psoas (psoas major) n. a muscle in the groin that acts jointly with the iliacus muscle to flex the hip joint (see illustration). A smaller muscle, psoas minor, has the same action but is often absent.

Psoas and iliacus muscles.





psoas sign an indicator of acute *appendicitis. The appendix lies close to the *iliopsoas muscle: if it is inflamed, any movement that involves the right psoas muscle (such as extension of the right thigh) will be painful in the right lower quadrant.

psoralen n. see PUVA.

psoriasis n. a chronic disease in which scaly pink patches form on the elbows, knees, scalp, and other parts of the body. Psoriasis is one of the commonest skin diseases in Britain, affecting about 2% of the population, although many mild cases are undiagnosed. The most common time of onset is in adolescence. It may occur in association with arthritis (see psoriatic arthritis), and severe psoriasis is associated with a higher risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The disease may be very severe, affecting much of the skin and causing considerable disability and psychological stress. Psoriasis is partly of genetic origin with polygenic influences. Exacerbations of psoriasis may be associated with streptococcal infection and drugs such as lithium and beta blockers.

There is no cure, but first-line treatments include *coal tar, *dithranol, and topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues (e.g. *calcipotriol). Narrow-band UVB or *PUVA can also be effective as can systemic therapies, such as *methotrexate, *retinoids, and *ciclosporin. Biological treatments, such as *infliximab, *adalimumab, and *etanercept, are potent but expensive.

psoriasis area severity index (PASI) a semiobjective severity score for psoriasis, including measurement of surface area affected and the degree of erythema, induration, and scale. It is commonly used in clinical trials and to ration expensive treatments for psoriasis. Severe disease equates to scores over 10 and it is often interpreted with the *dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score.

psoriatic arthritis arthritis associated with *psoriasis. It occurs in 5% of patients with psoriasis and may be painful and disabling. It often affects small joints, such as the terminal joints of the fingers and toes, the spine (*spondylitis), and sacroiliac joints (*sacroiliitis), or large joints, such as the knee.

psych- (psycho-) combining form denoting 1. the mind; psyche. 2. psychology.

psyche n. the mind or the soul; the mental (as opposed to the physical) functioning of the individual.

psychic adj. 1. of or relating to the *psyche. 2. relating to parapsychological phenomena. 3. describing a person who is allegedly endowed with extrasensory or psychokinetic powers.

psychoanalysis n. a school of psychology and a method of treating mental disorders based upon the teachings of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). Psychoanalysis employs the technique of *free association in the course of intensive *psychotherapy in order to bring repressed fears and conflicts to the conscious mind, where they can be dealt with (see repression). It stresses the dynamic interplay of unconscious forces and the importance of sexual development in childhood for the development of personality. —psychoanalyst n. —psychoanalytic adj.

psychodrama n. a form of group psychotherapy in which individuals acquire insight into themselves by acting out situations from their past with other group members. See group therapy.

psychogenic adj. having an origin in the mind rather than in the body. The term is applied particularly to symptoms and illnesses.

psychogenic polydipsia see polydipsia.

psychologist n. a person who is engaged in the scientific study of the mind. A psychologist studies psychology for at least three years and then may work in a university, in industry, in schools, or in a hospital. A clinical psychologist has been trained in aspects of the assessment and treatment of the ill and disabled. He or she usually works in a hospital, often as one of a multidisciplinary team. An educational psychologist has been trained in aspects of the cognitive and emotional development of children. He or she usually works in close association with schools and advises on the management of children.

psychology n. the scientific study of behaviour and its related mental processes. Psychology is concerned with such matters as memory, rational and irrational thought, intelligence, learning, personality, perceptions, and emotions and their relationship to behaviour. Schools of psychology differ in their philosophy and methods. They include the introspectionist Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian schools and the gestaltist, behaviourist, and cognitive schools; contemporary psychology tends strongly towards the latter (see cognitive psychology). Many practical psychologists profess not to belong to any school; some take an eclectic position. The branches of psychology, on the other hand, are functional or professional subspecialities based on practical considerations. They include abnormal, analytic, applied, clinical, comparative, developmental, educational, experimental, geriatric, industrial, infant, physiological, and social psychology. —psychological adj.

psychometrics n. the measurement of individual differences in psychological functions (such as intelligence and personality) by means of standardized tests. —psychometric adj.

psychomotor adj. relating to muscular and mental activity. The term is applied to disorders in which muscular activities are affected by cerebral disturbance.

psychomotor epilepsy see epilepsy.

psychoneuroimmunology n. the study of the effects of the mind on the functioning of the immune system, especially in relation to the influence of the mind on susceptibility to disease and the progression of a disease.

psychopath n. a person who behaves in an antisocial way and shows little or no guilt for antisocial acts and little capacity for forming emotional relationships with others. Psychopaths tend to respond poorly to treatment and do not learn from punishment, but many mature as they age. See also antisocial personality disorder. —psychopathic adj. —psychopathy n.

psychopathology n. 1. the study of mental disorders, with the aim of explaining and describing aberrant behaviour. Compare psychiatry. 2. the symptoms, collectively, of a mental disorder.

—psychopathological adj.

psychopharmacology n. the study of the effects of drugs on mental processes and behaviour, particularly *psychotropic drugs.

psychophysiology n. the branch of psychology that records physiological measurements, such as the electrical resistance of the skin, the heart rate, the size of the pupil, and the electroencephalogram, and relates them to psychological events. —psychophysiological adj.

psychosexual development the process by which an individual becomes more mature in his or her sexual feelings and behaviour. Gender identity, sex-role behaviour, and choice of sexual partner are the three major areas of development. In Freudian psychoanalysis the phrase is sometimes used specifically for a sequence of stages, supposed by psychoanalytic psychologists to be universal, in which oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages successively occur. These stages reflect the parts of the body on which sexual interest is concentrated during childhood development.

psychosis n. one of a group of *mental illnesses that feature loss of contact with reality. The psychoses include *schizophrenia, major disorders of affect (see bipolar affective disorder), major *paranoid states, drug intoxication, and organic mental disorders. They can be chronic or transient. Psychotic disorders manifest some of the following: *delusions, *hallucinations, severe thought disturbances, abnormal alteration of mood, poverty of thought, ego disturbances, and inappropriate *affect. Many cases of psychotic illness respond well to *antipsychotic drugs. —psychotic adj.

psychosocial assessment an interviewing technique that combines psychiatric history taking with elements of problem solving in *psychotherapy: after a psychiatric history has been elicited, the interviewer summarizes the patient’s difficulties and offers potential solutions. It is often used in patients who have presented with *deliberate self-harm, and research suggests that it offers the possibility of reducing repetition rates in such patients.

psychosomatic adj. relating to or involving both the mind and body: usually applied to illnesses that are caused by the interaction of mental and physical factors. Certain physical illnesses, including asthma, eczema, and peptic ulcer, are thought to be in part a response to psychological and social stresses. Psychological treatments sometimes have a marked effect, but are usually much less effective than physical treatments for such illnesses.

psychosurgery n. surgery on the brain to relieve psychological symptoms. The procedure is irreversible and is therefore reserved for the most severe and intractable of symptoms, particularly severe chronic anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder, depression, and untreatable pain. Side-effects can be severe but are less common with modern selective operations. In the UK psychosurgery cannot be performed without the patient’s specific informed *consent and a second opinion by another psychiatrist. —psychosurgical adj.

psychotherapy n. psychological (as opposed to physical) methods for the treatment of mental disorders and psychological problems. There are many different approaches to psychotherapy, including *psychoanalysis, *client-centred therapy, *group therapy, and *family therapy. These approaches share the views that the relationship between therapist and client is of prime importance, that the goal is to help personal development and self-understanding generally rather than only to remove symptoms, and that the therapist does not direct the client’s decisions. They have all been very widely applied to differing clinical conditions; in the treatment of *mental illness, various psychotherapeutic approaches are used with success, for example *cognitive behavioural therapy in depression and anxiety and psychosocial interventions in schizophrenia. See also behaviour therapy; counselling. —psychotherapeutic adj. —psychotherapist n.

psychoticism n. one of the three traits used by the British psychologist Hans Eysenck in his personality model, the others being extroversion and *neuroticism. Psychoticism is a personality pattern typified by aggressiveness and interpersonal hostility. Eysenck believed that high levels of this trait were linked to increased vulnerability to *psychosis but this has never been verified by subsequent research.

psychotropic adj. describing drugs that affect mood. *Antidepressants, *sedatives, CNS *stimulants, and *antipsychotics are psychotropic.

psychro- combining form denoting cold.

psychrophilic adj. describing organisms, especially bacteria, that grow best at temperatures of 0–25°C. Compare mesophilic; thermophilic.

PTA pure tone *audiogram.

PTC 1. percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (see cholangiography). 2. see phenylthiocarbamide.

pterion n. the point on the side of the skull at which the sutures between the *parietal, *temporal, and *sphenoid bones meet.

pteroylglutamic acid see folate.

pterygium n. 1. a triangular overgrowth of the cornea, usually the nasal side, by thickened and degenerative conjunctiva. It is most commonly seen in people from dry hot climates, is caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight, and only rarely interferes with vision. 2. a triangular overgrowth of nail-fold skin extending onto the nail bed. It may occur as a result of such conditions as *lichen planus and *epidermolysis bullosa.

pterygo- combining form denoting the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. Example: pterygomaxillary (of the pterygoid process and the maxilla).

pterygoid process either of two large processes of the *sphenoid bone.

PTH-RP see parathyroid hormone-related protein.

ptomaine n. any of various substances produced in decaying foodstuffs and responsible for the unpleasant taste and smell of such foods. These compounds – which include putrescine, cadaverine, and neurine – were formerly thought to be responsible for food poisoning, but although they are often associated with toxic bacteria they themselves are harmless.

ptosis (blepharoptosis) n. drooping of the upper eyelid, for which there are several causes. It may be due to a disorder of the third cranial nerve (*oculomotor nerve), in which case it is likely to be accompanied by paralysis of eye movements causing double vision and an enlarged pupil. When part of *Horner’s syndrome, ptosis is accompanied by a small pupil and an absence of sweating on that side of the face. It may be due to *myasthenia gravis, in which the ptosis increases with fatigue and is part of a more widespread fatiguable weakness. Ptosis is associated with the severe pain and other symptoms of a *cluster headache. It may also occur as an isolated congenital feature or as part of a disease of the eye muscles, when it is associated with weak or absent eye movements.

-ptosis combining form denoting a lowered position of an organ or part; prolapse. Example: colpoptosis (of the vagina).

PTSD see post-traumatic stress disorder.

PTTK partial thromboplastin time with kaolin, also known as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT): a method for estimating the degree of anticoagulation induced by heparin therapy for venous thrombosis.

ptyal- (ptyalo-) combining form denoting saliva. Example: ptyalorrhoea (excessive flow of).

ptyalin n. an enzyme (an *amylase) found in saliva.

ptyalism (sialorrhoea) n. the excessive production of saliva: a symptom of certain nervous disorders, poisoning (by mercury, mushrooms, or organophosphates), or infection (rabies). Compare dry mouth.

ptyalith n. a stone (*calculus) in a salivary gland or duct.

ptyalography n. see sialography.

puberty n. the time at which the onset of sexual maturity occurs and the reproductive organs become functional (see gonadarche). This is manifested in both sexes by the appearance of *secondary sexual characteristics (e.g. deepening of the voice in boys; growth of breasts in girls) and in girls by the start of *menstruation. These changes are brought about by an increase in sex hormone activity due to stimulation of the ovaries and testes by pituitary hormones. See also adrenarche; androgen; oestrogen; precocious puberty. —pubertal adj.

pubes n. 1. the body surface that overlies the pubis, at the front of the pelvis. It is covered with pubic hair. 2. see pubis. —pubic adj.

pubiotomy n. an operation to divide the pubic bone near the symphysis, the front midline where the left and right pubic bones meet. Pubiotomy is now only rarely performed during childbirth if it is necessary to increase the size of an abnormally small pelvis to allow passage of the child and a Caesarean section is contraindicated. It is occasionally also done to facilitate access to the base of the bladder and the urethra during complex urological procedures (e.g. *urethroplasty).

pubis n. (pl. pubes) a bone forming the lower and anterior part of each side of the *hip bone (see also pelvis). The two pubes meet at the front of the pelvis at the pubic symphysis. See also pubes.

public access defibrillation programmes programmes of lay education in the UK that aim to provide training in cardiac resuscitation up to and including *defibrillation. Together with programmes to increase the availability of *automated external defibrillators in public places (e.g. shops and railway stations), they recognize that the best outcomes from cardiac resuscitation are obtained with early defibrillation and good bystander basic life support.

publication ethics the standards expected from those who write, publish, and disseminate research. The International Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), comprising the editors and publishers of most major academic biomedical journals, consults and advises on aspects of publication ethics, such as research misconduct, plagiarism, so-called gift authorship, determination of contribution to research, and peer review processes.

• A detailed guide to publication ethics from COPE

public health consultant (in Britain) a medical consultant with postgraduate training in public health. Formerly known as community physicians, such consultants undertake public health functions, either as *Directors of Public Health in local authorities or as consultants in public health in local authorities, *Public Health England, or elsewhere. See also public health specialist.

Public Health England (PHE) an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care with responsibility for providing national leadership on health protection, health improvement, and public health knowledge and information. In addition to the national team, there are four regional offices and nine local centres providing public health support to *clinical commissioning groups, local authorities, and health-care providers. PHE also hosts a network of specialist and reference microbiology laboratories. It was formed as a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012; it absorbed the functions of a number of abolished bodies, including the *Health Protection Agency, the national network of public health observatories, and the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse.

public health ethics the ethics of population (as opposed to individual) health, including issues related to epidemiology, disease prevention, health promotion, *justice, and *equality. Public health ethics is commonly concerned with the tensions between individual *autonomy and *communitarianism and/or *utilitarianism.

public health medicine the specialty concerned with preventing disease and improving health in populations as distinct from individuals. Formerly known as community medicine or social medicine, it includes *epidemiology, *health promotion, *health service planning, *health protection, and evaluation. See also public health consultant.

Public Health Service (PHS) the oldest and one of the largest US federal health agencies. Founded in 1798 as a system of hospitals for sailors, the PHS is now the major health service operating division of the *Department of Health and Human Services and administers eleven agencies, including the *Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The agency employs tens of thousands of people with a total annual budget well into the billions.

public health specialist a public health practitioner with postgraduate training in public health or with demonstrated competence in key areas of public health practice. These specialists perform the same roles as *public health consultants but do not have medical training.

public interest disclosure 1. the expression of concern about performance or competence that is privileged at law by virtue of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. The statute provides that where an employee acts in good faith in questioning the behaviour or performance of another member of staff or an organization, he or she should be protected from such penalties as disciplinary procedures, suspension, or dismissal. See also whistle-blowing. 2. circumstances in which *confidentiality can be breached because there is a serious risk of physical harm to an identifiable individual or individuals. The basis on which confidentiality can be breached in the public interest were defined in the case of W v Egdell, in which the court held that the risk had to be of physical harm to identifiable person(s) and must not be merely ‘fanciful’. Where there is a serious risk of physical harm to a specific person, there is an entitlement but not a duty to breach confidentiality, and the *General Medical Council requires that doctors must be prepared to justify their decision either way.

Public Services Ombudsman see Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.

pubovaginal sling a band of material inserted directly under the bladder neck as a treatment for women with stress *incontinence. The sling can be constructed from fascia (connective tissue) obtained from the patient or it can be synthetic. Compare tension-free vaginal tape.

pudendal nerve the nerve that supplies the lowest muscles of the pelvic floor and the anal sphincter. It is often damaged in childbirth, causing incontinence.

pudendum n. (pl. pudenda) the external genital organs, especially those of the female (see vulva). —pudendal adj.

puerperal adj. relating to childbirth or the period that immediately follows it. See puerperium.

puerperal cardiomyopathy a rare complication of pregnancy, occurring from the sixth month of pregnancy until six months postnatally (usually within six weeks of delivery). It can follow pre-eclampsia. It is characterized by palpitations, dyspnoea, oedema (peripheral and central), and impaired exercise tolerance. The diagnosis is confirmed on echocardiography. It has a high mortality and morbidity. Treatment of heart failure, anticoagulation, and in some cases immunosuppressant therapy is required; in some cases heart transplantation may be considered.

puerperal infection infection of the female genital tract arising as a complication of childbirth. See also sepsis.

puerperal psychosis a *psychosis that is triggered by childbirth and usually arises in the first two weeks after giving birth. It affects 1 in 200 women; those suffering from bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia or those who have a history of puerperal psychosis are at particularly high risk. The symptoms develop very rapidly and the patient needs to be hospitalized, ideally in a mother and baby psychiatric unit to avoid separation; most patients respond well to *antipsychotic medication.

puerperal pyrexia a temperature of 38°C occurring on any 2 days within 14 days of childbirth or miscarriage. It is an indicator of postpartum *sepsis.

puerperium n. the period of up to about six weeks after childbirth, during which the mother’s body returns to its prepregnant state and her uterus returns to its normal size (i.e. involution takes place).

Pulex n. a genus of widely distributed *fleas. P. irritans, the human flea, is a common parasite whose bite may give rise to intense irritation and bacterial infection. It is an intermediate host for larvae of the tapeworms *Hymenolepis and *Dipylidium, which it can transmit to humans, and it may also be involved in the transmission of plague.

Pulfrich phenomenon perception of the lateral motion of an object in the visual field as having a depth component, due to a relative difference in signal timings between the two eyes. It often occurs spontaneously in several diseases affecting the eyes, such as cataract, *retrobulbar neuritis, and multiple sclerosis. [C. Pulfrich (20th century), German physicist]

pulmo- (pulmon(o)-) combining form denoting the lung(s).

pulmonary adj. relating to, associated with, or affecting the lungs.

pulmonary artery the artery that conveys blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation: the only artery in the body containing deoxygenated blood. It leaves the right ventricle and passes upwards for 5 cm before dividing into two, one branch going to each lung. Within the lungs each pulmonary artery divides into many fine branches, which end in capillaries in the alveolar walls. See also pulmonary circulation.

pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) an indirect measurement of the pressure of blood in the left atrium of the heart, which indicates the adequacy of left heart function. It is measured using a catheter wedged in the most distal segment of the pulmonary artery. See also Swan-Ganz catheter.

pulmonary circulation a system of blood vessels effecting transport of blood between the heart and lungs. Deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle by the pulmonary artery and is carried to the alveolar capillaries of the lungs. Gaseous exchange occurs, with carbon dioxide leaving the circulation and oxygen entering. The oxygenated blood then passes into small veins leading to the pulmonary veins, which leave the lungs and return blood to the left atrium of the heart. The oxygenated blood can then be pumped around the body via the *systemic circulation.

pulmonary embolism obstruction of the *pulmonary artery or one of its branches by an *embolus, usually a blood clot derived from *phlebothrombosis of the leg veins (deep vein thrombosis). Large pulmonary emboli result in acute heart failure or sudden death. Smaller emboli cause death of sections of lung tissue, pleurisy, and haemoptysis (coughing of blood). Minor pulmonary emboli respond to the *anticoagulant drugs heparin and warfarin. Major pulmonary embolism is treated by *embolectomy or by dissolution of the blood clot with an infusion of *streptokinase. Recurrent pulmonary embolism may result in *pulmonary hypertension.

pulmonary hypertension a condition in which there is raised blood pressure within the blood vessels supplying the lungs (the pulmonary artery blood pressure is normally much lower than the pressure within the aorta and its branches). Pulmonary hypertension may complicate pulmonary embolism, *septal defects, heart failure, diseases of the mitral valve, and chronic lung diseases. It may also develop without any known cause (primary pulmonary hypertension). The right ventricle enlarges and heart failure, fainting, and chest pain occur. The treatment is that of the cause; drugs used to control *hypertension are ineffective, but some specific drug treatments (e.g. epoprostenol) have recently become available.

pulmonary regurgitation leakage of the pulmonary valve in the heart. Mild regurgitation is a common normal finding, but severe congenital pulmonary regurgitation may require surgical correction.

pulmonary stenosis congenital narrowing of the outlet of the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery. The defect may be in the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or in the outflow tract of the right ventricle below the valve (infundibular stenosis). It may be isolated or combined with other heart defects (e.g. *tetralogy of Fallot). Severe pulmonary stenosis may produce angina pectoris, faintness, and heart failure. The defect is corrected by surgery.

pulmonary tuberculosis see tuberculosis.

pulmonary valve a valve in the heart lying between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. It is a *semilunar valve that prevents blood returning to the ventricle from the pulmonary artery.

pulmonary vein a vein carrying oxygenated blood from the lung to the left atrium. See pulmonary circulation.

pulp n. 1. a soft mass of tissue (for example, of the *spleen, in which there is both red pulp and white pulp). 2. the mass of connective tissue in the pulp cavity, at the centre of a *tooth. It is surrounded by dentine except where it communicates with the rest of the body at the apex. The pulp within the crown portion of the pulp cavity is described as coronal pulp; that within the root canal is the radicular pulp. 3. the fleshy cushion on the flexor surface of the fingertip.

pulp capping the procedure of covering an exposed tooth pulp (direct pulp cap) or nearly exposed tooth pulp (indirect pulp cap) following trauma with a medicament (usually based on calcium hydroxide), which is then covered with a temporary or permanent *restoration.

pulpectomy n. the removal of the entire pulp tissue from the crown to the root of a tooth in order to treat infection. This is an essential part of *root canal treatment and of *endodontics generally.

pulpitis n. inflammation of the pulp of a tooth: a frequent cause of toothache. Pulpitis may be reversible or irreversible. Irreversible pulpitis often requires *root canal treatment.

pulpotomy n. a procedure in which part of the pulp of a tooth damaged by trauma or caries is removed and then covered with a medicament and *restoration. The aim is to maintain the vitality of the remaining pulpal tissue.

pulsatile adj. characterized by regular rhythmical beating.

pulsatile tinnitus a form of *tinnitus that has a rhythmical quality. It may be synchronous with the heartbeat, in which case a vascular origin is likely. Pulsatile tinnitus that is not synchronous with the heartbeat may have a muscular origin due to *middle ear muscle myoclonus or *palatal myoclonus. Pulsatile tinnitus may be audible to an observer, in which case it is classified as objective pulsatile tinnitus. More often it is inaudible to others and is classified as subjective pulsatile tinnitus.

pulse n. a series of pressure waves within an artery caused by contractions of the left ventricle and corresponding with the heart rate (the number of times the heart beats per minute). It is easily detected on such superficial arteries as the radial artery near the wrist and the carotid artery in the neck (see illustration). The average adult pulse rate at rest is 60–80 per minute, but exercise, injury, illness, and emotion may produce much faster rates.

Peripheral pulses.





pulseless disease see Takayasu’s disease.

pulseless electrical activity (electromechanical dissociation) the appearance of normal-looking complexes on the electrocardiogram that are, however, associated with a state of *cardiac arrest. It is usually caused by large pulmonary emboli (see pulmonary embolism), *cardiac tamponade, tension *pneumothorax, severe disturbance of body salt levels, severe haemorrhage, or hypothermia causing severe lack of oxygen to the heart muscle.

pulsus alternans alternate variation of the force of the pulse due to variation in force of heart muscle contraction. It is a sign of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.

pulsus paradoxus an exaggerated fall in systolic blood pressure and pulse volume when the patient breathes in. It is seen in constrictive *pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and asthma.

pulvinar n. the expanded posterior end of the *thalamus.

punch-drunk syndrome a group of symptoms consisting of progressive *dementia, tremor of the hands, epilepsy, and parkinsonism. It is a consequence of repeated blows to the head that have been severe enough to cause *concussion.

punctum n. (pl. puncta) (in anatomy) a point or small area, especially the puncta lacrimalia – the two openings of the tear ducts in the inner corners of the upper and lower eyelids (see lacrimal apparatus).

puncture 1. n. a wound made accidentally or deliberately by a sharp object or instrument. Puncture wounds need careful treatment as a small entry hole in the skin can disguise serious injury in an underlying organ or tissue. Punctures are also performed for diagnostic purposes using a hollow needle, in order to withdraw a sample of tissue or fluid for examination; needle punctures are used especially for obtaining tissue samples for the liver, bone marrow, or breast. See also lumbar puncture. 2. vb. to pierce a tissue with a sharp instrument or needle. A gall bladder that is tense with bile may need to be punctured while being removed, to make it more amenable to manipulation.

pupil n. the circular opening in the centre of the *iris, through which light passes into the lens of the eye. —pupillary adj.

pupillary reflex (light reflex) the reflex change in the size of the pupil according to the amount of light entering the eye. Bright light reaching the retina stimulates nerves of the *parasympathetic nervous system, which cause the pupil to contract. In dim light the pupil opens, due to stimulation of the *sympathetic nervous system. See also iris.

pupilloplasty n. a surgical procedure to alter the shape or function of the pupil. It is usually performed to repair a pupil damaged after trauma.

PUPPS see polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.

pure tone audiogram (PTA) see audiogram.

purgation n. the use of drugs to stimulate intestinal activity and clear the bowels. See laxative.

purgative n. see laxative.

purine n. a nitrogen-containing compound with a two-ring molecular structure. Examples of purines are adenine and guanine, which form the *nucleotides of nucleic acids, and uric acid, which is the end-product of purine metabolism.

Purkinje cells nerve cells found in great numbers in the cortex of the cerebellum. The cell body is flask-shaped, with numerous dendrites branching from the neck and extending fanwise among other cells towards the surface and a long axon that runs from the base deep into the cerebellum. [J. E. Purkinje (1787–1869), Bohemian physiologist]

Purkinje fibres see atrioventricular bundle.

purpura n. a skin rash resulting from bleeding into the skin from small blood vessels (capillaries); the individual purple spots of the rash are called petechiae. Purpura may be due either to defects in the capillaries (nonthrombocytopenic purpura) or to a deficiency of blood platelets (thrombocytopenic purpura). See Henoch–Schönlein purpura; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; thrombocytopenia; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Purtscher’s retinopathy damage to the retina associated with severe head injuries. It can also occur with other types of trauma, such as long-bone fractures, and with several nontraumatic systemic diseases. [O. Purtscher (1852–1927), Austrian ophthalmologist]

purulent adj. forming, consisting of, or containing pus.

pus n. a thick yellowish or greenish liquid formed at the site of an established infection. Pus contains dead white blood cells, both living and dead bacteria, and fragments of dead tissue. See also mucopus; seropus.

push-bang technique a technique for removing a stone from the ureter. It consists of ‘pushing’ the stone back into the renal pelvis, where it can be destroyed by *lithotripsy (‘bang’).

pustule n. a small pus-containing blister on the skin.

putamen n. a part of the lenticular nucleus (see basal ganglia).

putrefaction n. the process whereby proteins are decomposed by bacteria. This is accompanied by the formation of amines (such as putrescine and cadaverine) having a strong and very unpleasant smell.

putrescine n. an amine formed during *putrefaction.

PUVA (photochemotherapy) psoralen + ultraviolet A: the combination of a psoralen (a light-sensitive drug) and exposure to long-wave (315–400 nm) ultraviolet light (UVA). It was used in the East in ancient times, with natural sunlight as the light source, for the treatment of *vitiligo. It is now principally used for treating *psoriasis; a number of other conditions also respond.

P value see significance.

PVP see photoselective vaporization of the prostate.

PVS see persistent vegetative state.

py- (pyo-) combining form denoting pus; a purulent condition. Example: pyoureter (pus in a ureter).

pyaemia n. blood poisoning by pus-forming bacteria released from an abscess. The widespread formation of abscesses may develop, with fatal results. Compare sapraemia; septicaemia; toxaemia.

pyarthrosis n. an infected joint filled with pus (see septic arthritis).

pyel- (pyelo-) combining form denoting the pelvis of the kidney. Example: pyelectasis (dilation of).

pyelitis n. inflammation of the pelvis of the kidney (the part of the kidney from which urine drains into the ureter). This is usually caused by a bacterial infection, which may develop in any condition causing obstruction to the flow of urine. The patient experiences pain in the loins, shivering, and a high temperature. Treatment is by the administration of a suitable antibiotic, together with analgesics and a high fluid intake. Any underlying abnormality of the urinary system must be relieved to prevent further attacks.

pyelocystitis n. inflammation of the renal pelvis and urinary bladder (see pyelitis; cystitis).

pyelogram n. see pyelography.

pyelography n. X-ray examination of the renal pelvis using *radiopaque contrast material. Anterograde pyelography is performed by puncturing the renal pelvis directly with a needle through the skin and injecting contrast material. Intravenous pyelography is usually part of an examination of the whole urinary tract (see intravenous urography). Retrograde pyelography is performed after a tube has been inserted through the bladder and up the ureter at cystoscopy. Contrast material is injected up this tube as it is withdrawn and X-ray images taken. All techniques are used to show the anatomy of the renal pelvis and its drainage, as well as to demonstrate the presence of tumours and stones.

pyelolithotomy n. surgical removal of a stone from the kidney through an incision made in the pelvis of the kidney. The incision is usually made into the posterior surface of the pelvis (posterior pyelotomy) to gain access to the stone, which can then be lifted clear.

pyelonephritis n. bacterial infection of the kidney substance. In acute pyelonephritis, the patient has pain in the loins, a high temperature, and shivering fits. Treatment is by the administration of an appropriate antibiotic, and a full urological investigation is conducted to determine any underlying abnormality and prevent recurrence. In chronic pyelonephritis, the kidneys become small and scarred and kidney failure ensues. *Vesicoureteric reflux in childhood is one of the causes.

pyeloplasty n. an operation to relieve obstruction at the junction of the pelvis of the kidney and the ureter. The procedure is often performed laparoscopically. The narrowed segment may be excised and the renal pelvis and ureteric ends anastomosed or a flap of tissue from the renal pelvis may be folded down to widen the narrowing. A ureteric stent is left in place while healing takes place. See hydronephrosis; Dietl’s crisis.

pyelotomy n. surgical incision into the pelvis of the kidney. This operation is usually undertaken to remove a stone (see pyelolithotomy) but is also necessary when surgical drainage of the kidney is required by a catheter or tube.

Pyemotes n. see Pediculoides.

pyg- (pygo-) combining form denoting the buttocks.

pykno- combining form denoting thickness or density.

pyknosis n. the process in which the cell nucleus is thickened into a dense mass, which occurs when cells die. —pyknotic adj.

pyl- (pyle-) combining form denoting the portal vein.

pylephlebitis (portal pyaemia) n. septic inflammation and thrombosis of the hepatic portal vein. This is a rare result of the spread of infection within the abdomen (as from appendicitis). The condition causes severe illness, with fever, liver abscesses, and *ascites. Treatment is by antibiotic drugs and surgical drainage of abscesses.

pylethrombosis n. obstruction of the portal vein by a blood clot (see thrombosis). It can result from infection of the umbilicus in infants, pylephlebitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and liver tumours. *Portal hypertension is a frequent result.

PYLL see years of life lost.

pylorectomy n. a surgical operation that involves the removal of the distal part of the stomach (*pylorus). See antrectomy; pyloroplasty.

pyloric stenosis narrowing of the outlet of the stomach (*pylorus). This causes delay in the passage of stomach contents into the duodenum, leading to recurrent vomiting (sometimes of food eaten more than 24 hours earlier), abdominal distension, dehydration, and weight loss. Pyloric stenosis in adults is caused either by a *peptic ulcer adjacent to or within the pylorus or by a tumour invading the pylorus. Stenosis from peptic ulceration may be treated with antisecretory agents, endoscopic balloon dilatation of the pylorus, or by surgical removal or bypass (see gastroenterostomy). Surgery is usually required for cancerous obstruction; in unfit patients and those with metastatic disease a stent can be placed to relieve the obstruction. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis occurs in babies about 3–5 weeks old (particularly boys) in which the thickened pyloric muscle can be felt as a nodule. Treatment is by the surgical operation of *pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt’s operation).

pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt’s operation) n. a surgical operation in which the muscle around the outlet of the stomach (pylorus) is divided down to the lining (mucosa) in order to relieve congenital *pyloric stenosis.

pyloroplasty n. a surgical operation in which the outlet of the stomach (pylorus) is widened by a form of reconstruction. It is done to allow the contents of the stomach to pass more easily into the duodenum and is commonly combined with a truncal *vagotomy to treat peptic ulcers.

pylorospasm n. constriction of the pylorus due to muscle spasm, leading to delayed gastric emptying. It is usually associated with duodenal or pyloric ulcers.

pylorus n. the lower end of the *stomach, which leads to the duodenum. It terminates at a ring of muscle – the pyloric sphincter – which contracts to close the opening by which the stomach communicates with the duodenum. —pyloric adj.

It may be associated with ulcerative *colitis or *Crohn’s disease or with *rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of arthritis affecting many joints. Treatment is with ciclosporin, high doses of corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressants.

pyogenic adj. causing the formation of pus. Pyogenic bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus hemolyticus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

pyogenic arthritis see septic arthritis.

pyogenic granuloma a common rapidly growing nodule on the surface of the skin. Resembling a redcurrant or, if large, a raspberry, it is composed of small blood vessels and therefore bleeds readily after the slightest injury. The nodule never becomes malignant and is treated by *curettage and cautery; it may recur and require excision.

pyometritis n. inflammation of the uterus, with the formation of pus.

pyomyositis n. bacterial or fungal infection of a muscle resulting in painful inflammation.

pyonephrosis n. obstruction and infection of the kidney resulting in pus formation. A kidney stone is the usual cause of the obstruction, and the kidney becomes distended by pus and destroyed by the inflammation, which extends into the kidney substance itself and sometimes into the surrounding tissues (see perinephritis). Treatment is urgent *nephrectomy under antibiotic cover.

pyopneumothorax n. pus and gas or air in the *pleural cavity. The condition can arise if gas is produced by gas-forming bacteria as part of an *empyema or if air is introduced during attempts to drain the pus from an empyema. Alternatively a *hydropneumothorax may become infected.

pyramidal system a collection of nerve fibres in the central nervous system that extend from the *motor cortex in the brain to the spinal cord and are responsible for initiating movement. In the medulla oblongata the fibres form a *pyramid (hence the name), within which they cross from one side of the brain to the opposite side of the spinal cord; this is called the decussation of the pyramids. Damage to the pyramidal system manifests in a specific pattern of weakness in the face, arms, and legs, abnormally brisk reflexes, and an extensor *plantar reflex (Babinski response).

pyrazinamide n. a drug administered, in conjunction with other drugs, to treat tuberculosis. Side-effects may include digestive upsets, loss of appetite, joint pains, gout, fever, and rashes, and high doses may cause liver damage.

Q fever an acute infectious disease of many animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and dogs, that is caused by a *rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii; it can be transmitted to humans primarily through inhalation of infected particles or consumption of contaminated unpasteurized milk but also via ticks, which can act as vectors. After an incubation period of up to three weeks a severe influenza-like illness develops, sometimes with pneumonia. The disease lasts about two weeks; treatment with tetracyclines or chloramphenicol is effective. See also typhus.

qinghaosu n. see artemisinin.

QOF see Quality and Outcomes Framework.

QRISK2 a computer algorithm that estimates the risk of a heart attack or stroke in a person over the next ten years. QRISK2 uses traditional risk factors, such as age, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, together with additional risk factors, including body mass index and family history of premature ischaemic heart disease. Someone with a QRISK2 score of 20% (or more) is regarded as high risk and should consider lifestyle modification and preventative medication.

QRS complex the element of an *electrocardiogram that precedes the *S–T segment and indicates electrical activation of the ventricles.

Q–T interval the interval on an *electrocardiogram between the beginning of ventricular depolarization (*Q wave) and the beginning of *repolarization (the T wave). See also long QT syndrome.

Components of the quadriceps femoris.





quadriplegia (tetraplegia) n. paralysis affecting all four limbs, which may or may not be total. —quadriplegic adj., n.

qualitative research a type of scientific enquiry, used extensively in the social sciences, that focuses on the why and how of behaviours and opinions. It often involves interviews or focus groups through which the researcher attempts to understand individuals’ experiences. The data in qualitative research are non-numerical, being typically words or descriptions used by research subjects. Compare quantitative research.

Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) a system, introduced as part of the new general medical services (nGMS) contract (see general practitioner), whereby practices are rewarded for implementing good medical practice. There are four main domains: clinical, organizational, patient experience, and additional services. Each domain has various criteria based on best practice, which have a number of points allocated for achievement. The points are collated at the end of the financial year and converted into payment for the practice.

quality assurance setting, monitoring, and maintaining standards for the quality of a service. See clinical governance.

quality of life a measure of a person’s wellbeing that is relevant in two ways in medical ethics. (1) The experience, burden, and effects of disease as opposed to its duration are often invoked in debates about *abortion, *assisted suicide, *euthanasia, and the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment. The criteria for determining another person’s wellbeing are complex and contested, and some argue that competent adults are the best judges of their own quality of life. (2) The formal evaluation of losses and gains is employed to determine who will benefit most from a treatment and, on this basis, who should receive priority where resources are scarce. In such cases a calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is made, rather than a simpler estimate of how long a successfully treated patient can expect to live. Each expected year of full health is scored 1, each expected year with various degrees of illness or disability less than 1, and death 0. Research priorities are often made on the basis of a related metric, *disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which seeks to minimize the burden of disease. Both metrics have been criticized for discriminating against those with prior medical conditions, which lower their baseline score, and the elderly, whose longevity is short. See also need.

quantitative digital radiography a method of detecting *osteoporosis. A narrow X-ray beam is directed at the area of interest (usually the spine and hip), which enables a measurement to be made of its calcium content (density). In this way the likelihood of fracture can be assessed and preventive measures considered.

quantitative research a type of scientific enquiry that typically relies on statistical, mathematical, or computational tests and techniques. Quantitative research often involves the formulation of a null hypothesis (see significance); the data are typically numerical, such as counts, percentages, or statistical figures. Compare qualitative research.

quarantine n. the period for which a person (or animal) is kept in isolation in order to prevent the spread of a contagious disease. The original quarantine was a period of 40 days, but different diseases now have different quarantine periods.

quartan fever see malaria.

quinine n. a drug used in the treatment of *malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum. Large doses can cause severe poisoning, symptoms of which include headache, fever, vomiting, confusion and damage to sight and hearing (see cinchonism). Small doses of quinine are used to treat nocturnal leg cramps.

quinism n. the symptoms of overdosage or prolonged treatment with quinine. See cinchonism.

quinolone n. one of a group of chemically related synthetic antibiotics that includes *ciprofloxacin, *nalidixic acid, and *ofloxacin. These drugs act by inactivating an enzyme, DNA gyrase, that is necessary for replication of the microorganisms and are often useful for treating infections with organisms that have become resistant to other antibiotics. Possible side-effects of quinolones include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and itching. Confusion, joint pains, skin troubles, and tendinitis occasionally occur.

quinsy n. pus in the space between the tonsil and the wall of the pharynx. The patient has severe pain with difficulty opening the mouth (*trismus) and swallowing. Treatment is with antibiotics. Surgical incision of the abscess may be necessary to release the collection of pus. Medical name: peritonsillar abscess.

rabbit fever see tularaemia.

rabies (hydrophobia) n. an acute virus disease of the central nervous system that affects all warm-blooded animals and is usually transmitted to humans by a bite from an infected dog. Symptoms appear after an incubation period ranging from 10 days to over a year and include malaise, fever, difficulty in breathing, salivation, periods of intense excitement, hallucinations, and painful muscle spasms of the throat induced by swallowing. In the later stages of the disease the mere sight of water induces convulsions and paralysis; death occurs within 4–5 days. Daily injections of rabies vaccine, together with an injection of rabies antiserum, may prevent the disease from developing in a person bitten by an infected animal. —rabid adj.

racemose adj. resembling a bunch of grapes. The term is applied particularly to a compound gland the secretory part of which consists of a number of small sacs.

rachi- (rachio-) combining form denoting the spine.

rachis n. see backbone.

radial adj. relating to or associated with the radius (a bone in the forearm).

radial artery a branch of the brachial artery, beginning at the elbow and passing superficially down the forearm to the styloid process of the radius at the wrist. It then winds around the wrist and enters the palm of the hand, sending out branches to the fingers.

radial keratotomy an operation for short-sightedness (myopia). Deep cuts into the tissue of the cornea are placed radially around the outer two-thirds of the cornea; this flattens the curvature of the central part of the cornea and reduces the myopia. This procedure is now rarely performed, having been superseded by *excimer laser treatment.

radial nerve an important mixed sensory and motor nerve of the arm, forming the largest branch of the *brachial plexus. It extends downwards behind the humerus, supplying muscles of the upper arm, to the elbow, which it supplies with branches, and then runs parallel with the radius. It supplies sensory branches to the base of the thumb and a small area of the back of the hand.

radial reflex flexion of the forearm (and sometimes also of the fingers) that occurs when the lower end of the radius is tapped. It is due to contraction of the brachioradialis muscle, which is stimulated by tapping its point of insertion in the radius.

radiation n. energy in the form of waves or particles, especially electromagnetic radiation, which includes (in order of increasing energy) radio waves, microwaves, *infrared rays (radiant heat), visible light, *ultraviolet rays, *X-rays, and *gamma rays. The latter two are described as ionizing radiation due to their effect on other atoms and are potentially harmful. Particle radiation is described as alpha (a helium nucleus), beta (an electron), or *positron emission. Only the latter is commonly used for diagnostic imaging (see positron emission tomography).

radiation protection measures designed to limit the dose of harmful radiation to patients and workers. Medical exposure to radiation is governed in the UK by the Department of Health and Social Care under the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposures) Regulations 2000 (IRMER). A guiding theme of protection is the ALARA principle (“as low as reasonably achievable”).

radiation sickness an acute illness caused by extreme exposure to rays emitted by radioactive substances, e.g. X-rays or gamma rays. Very high doses can cause death within hours. Lower doses, which may eventually prove fatal, cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea followed after a week or more by bleeding and other symptoms of damage to the bone marrow, loss of hair, and bloody diarrhoea. Some of the milder symptoms can occur after *radiotherapy during treatment of cancer.

radical treatment vigorous treatment that aims at the complete cure of a disease rather than the mere relief of symptoms. Compare conservative treatment.

radicle n. (in anatomy) 1. a small *root. 2. the initial fibre of a nerve or the origin of a vein. —radicular adj.

radiculitis n. inflammation of the root of a nerve. See polyradiculitis.

radio- combining form denoting 1. radiation. 2. radioactive substances.

radioactive iodine therapy the administration of an estimated amount of the radioactive isotope iodine-131 as a drink in order to treat an overactive thyroid gland (see thyrotoxicosis). The iodine concentrates in the thyroid and thus delivers its beta radiation locally, with little effect on other tissues. The gland will shrink and become euthyroid over the succeeding 8–12 weeks but there is a high incidence of subsequent hypothyroidism (up to 80%), which requires lifetime treatment with thyroxine. The treatment cannot be used if there is any suspicion of pregnancy, and the patient must stay away from young children and pregnant women for around 10 days after administration. Despite these drawbacks, radioactive iodine remains a popular form of treatment for any cause of hyperthyroidism.

radioactivity n. disintegration of the nuclei of certain elements, leading to the emission of energy in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma rays. As particles are emitted the elements ‘decay’ into other elements. Naturally occurring radioactive elements include radium and uranium. There are many artificially produced isotopes, including iodine-131 and cobalt-60 used in *radiotherapy; technetium-99m is used in *nuclear medicine. See radioisotope. —radioactive adj.

radioautography n. see autoradiography.

radiobiology n. the study of the effects of radiation on living cells and organisms. Studies of the behaviour of cancer cells exposed to radiation have important applications in *radiotherapy, revealing why some tumours fail to respond to the treatment; this has led to the development of new radiotherapy techniques that make tumours more susceptible to treatment by radiation.

radiodermatitis n. inflammation of the skin after exposure to ionizing radiation. This may occur after a short dose of heavy radiation (radiotherapy or atomic explosions) or prolonged exposure to small doses, as may happen accidentally to X-ray workers. The skin becomes dry, hairless, and atrophied, losing its colouring.

radioembolization (selective internal radiation therapy; SIRT) n. an *interventional radiology technique used in liver cancers. It is similar to *transarterial chemoembolization, but instead of a chemotherapeutic agent yttrium-90 particles are injected into the liver. These emit beta radiation, which kills the cells within 2 mm of their radius. SIRT is a palliative technique.

radiofrequency ablation (RFA) the selective destruction of abnormal conducting tissue in the heart by the targeted delivery of radiofrequency energy via a catheter under X-ray and electrocardiographic guidance. It is usually curative in patients with supraventricular re-entrant tachycardia and is the treatment of choice for this condition (see supraventricular tachycardia; Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome). It can be used for a variety of other arrhythmias with varying degrees of success. *Cryoablation is an alternative approach that uses freezing to destroy the abnormal tissue.

radiofrequency palatal myoplasty (RPM) see palatoplasty.

radiographer n. 1. (diagnostic radiographer) a person who is trained in the technique of taking X-ray images of parts of the body. In modern practice a radiographer may also perform other imaging techniques, including *magnetic resonance imaging, *ultrasound, and *nuclear medicine. 2. (therapeutic radiographer) a person who is trained in the technique of treatment by *radiotherapy.

radiography n. diagnostic radiology: traditionally, the technique of examining the body by directing *X-rays through it to produce images (radiographs) on photographic film or a fluoroscope. Increasingly radiography involves the production of images by *computerized tomography, *magnetic resonance imaging, and *nuclear medicine. It is used to produce images of disease in all parts of the body, to be interpreted by radiologists for physicians and surgeons. It is also widely used in dentistry for detecting dental caries, periodontal disease, periapical disease, the presence and position of unerupted teeth, and disease of the jaws. See also radiographer; radiology.

radioimmunoassay n. a technique using radioactive antibodies as *tracers to estimate the levels of natural substances in a blood sample. The antibodies bind to antigens, and the amount of radioactivity trapped is a measure of the amount of the target antigen present. The technique is widely used in the estimation of hormone levels.

radioimmunolocalization n. a method of identifying the site of a tumour (e.g. colorectal cancer) that relies on its uptake of radioactive isotopes attached to an appropriate anticancer immune cell. As yet this technique is little used in clinical practice.

radioimmunotherapy n. treatment in which a radioactive substance is linked to an antibody that attaches to a specific type of tumour cell, thus delivering the radiation to the tumour and limiting damage to healthy cells. See monoclonal antibody.

radioiodine ablation the use of radioactive iodine (iodine-131) to destroy any residual thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy for cancer. Subsequent radioiodine treatment may be necessary to treat suspected or known residual thyroid cancer cells. Following ablation, thyroglobulin levels can be used as a *tumour marker.

radioisotope n. an *isotope of an element that emits alpha, beta, or gamma radiation during its decay into another element. Artificial radioisotopes, produced by bombarding elements with beams of neutrons, are widely used in medicine as *tracers and as sources of radiation for the different techniques of *radiotherapy.

radiologist n. a physician specializing in the interpretation of X-rays and other imaging techniques for the diagnosis of disease. An interventional radiologist specializes in the use of imaging to guide *interventional radiology techniques.

radiology n. the branch of medicine involving the study of radiographs or other imaging technologies (such as *ultrasound and *magnetic resonance imaging) to diagnose or treat disease. A physician specializing in this field is known as a *radiologist. See also interventional radiology; radiography.

radiology information system (RIS) a computer database used to keep details of all the patients attending a clinical radiology department. It records patient demographics, imaging procedures done, medications given and dosage, person performing the imaging, and time and place of examination. Radiologist reports interpreting the images will also feature here. The RIS is vital to the functioning of a picture archiving and communications system (see PACS) and the electronic medical record system.

radiolucent adj. having the property of being transparent to X-rays (i.e. allowing X-rays to pass through). Radiopacity (blocking X-rays) decreases with atomic number of the element. Radiolucent materials, such as beryllium, are used to construct windows in X-ray tubes to allow the X-rays to escape from the tube. Gases are relatively radiolucent to X-rays and can be used as a negative *contrast medium in X-ray examinations, e.g. in *double-contrast barium examinations of the bowel or carbon dioxide *arteriography.

radionecrosis n. death (*necrosis) of tissue, commonly bone or skin, caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, as in *radiotherapy. It can be induced by subsequent injury or surgery. See ionization.

radionuclide n. a substance containing a radioactive atomic nucleus. Radionuclides can be used as *tracers for diagnosis in *nuclear medicine.

radiopaque adj. having the property of absorbing, and therefore being opaque to, X-rays. Radiopacity increases with atomic weight. Radiopaque materials, such as those containing iodine or barium, are used as *contrast media in radiography. Metallic foreign bodies in tissues are also radiopaque and can be detected by radiography. Such heavy elements as lead and barium can be used in shielding to protect people from unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. —radiopacity n.

radiopeptide n. see peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.

radiosensitive adj. describing certain forms of cancer cell that are particularly susceptible to radiation and are likely to be dealt with successfully by radiotherapy.

radiosensitizer n. a substance that increases the sensitivity of cells to radiation. The presence of oxygen and other compounds with a high affinity for electrons will increase radiosensitivity. Chemotherapy drugs such as fluorouracil and cisplatin can be used concurrently with radiotherapy as radiosensitizers (see chemoradiotherapy).

radiotherapist n. a doctor who specializes in treatment with radiotherapy.

radiotherapy n. therapeutic radiology: the treatment of disease with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, beta rays, or gamma rays, which may be produced by machines or given off by radioactive isotopes. Beams of radiation may be directed at a diseased part from a distance (see teletherapy), or radioactive material, in the form of needles, wires, or pellets, may be implanted in the body (see brachytherapy). Many forms of cancer are destroyed by radiotherapy.

radium n. a radioactive metallic element that emits alpha and gamma rays during its decay into other elements. The gamma radiation was formerly employed in *radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Because *radon, a radioactive gas, is released from radium, the metal was enclosed in gas-tight containers during use. Radium is stored in lead-lined containers, which give protection from the radiation. Symbol: Ra.

radius n. the outer and shorter bone of the forearm (compare ulna). It partially revolves about the ulna, permitting *pronation and *supination of the hand. The head of the radius articulates with the *humerus. The lower end articulates both with the scaphoid and lunate bones of the *carpus (wrist) and with the ulna (via the ulnar notch on the side of the bone). —radial adj.

radix n. see root.

radon n. a radioactive gaseous element that is produced during the decay of *radium. Sealed in small capsules called radon seeds, it is used in *radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer, but has largely been replaced by newer agents and techniques. It emits alpha and gamma radiation. Symbol: Rn.

rale n. see crepitation.

raloxifene n. a drug used to prevent and treat osteoporosis that develops after the menopause. Raloxifene is a *selective (o)estrogen receptor modulator (SERM): it mimics the protective action of oestrogen in the bones without the risk of the adverse effects (e.g. on the breast and uterus) associated with *hormone replacement therapy. However, it does not relieve menopausal symptoms. Side-effects include hot flushes, and there is a risk of *thromboembolism and *thrombophlebitis.

raltegravir n. an *antiretroviral drug (ARV) used, in combination with other ARVs, for treating refractory HIV infection. It acts by inhibiting integrase, an enzyme required by the virus to replicate and infect other cells. Side-effects include abdominal pain, constipation, and *lipodystrophy.

randomized controlled trial see intervention study.

random sample a subgroup of a total population selected by a random process ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. It is sometimes stratified so that separate samples are drawn from each of several layers of the population, usually on the basis of age, sex, and socio-economic group. Selection is sometimes facilitated by identifying, in advance, certain units (e.g. towns or neighbourhoods) that will together represent the whole (a so-called sampling frame).

ranibizumab n. a recombinant *monoclonal antibody fragment used for the treatment of wet age-related *macular degeneration. It inhibits *vascular endothelial growth factor and therefore choroidal *neovascularization. Common side-effects are conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, *floaters, increased intraocular pressure, and intraocular inflammation. *Aflibercept and pegaptanib have similar uses and effects.

ranitidine n. an H2-receptor antagonist (see antihistamine) that is used in the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Side-effects include headache, diarrhoea, rash, and drowsiness.

RANKL inhibitor receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand inhibitor: an agent that works by inhibiting the development of *osteoclasts and bone resorption, thus minimizing bone loss and the potential for fractures in those with postmenopausal osteoporosis and bone metastases.

ranula n. a cyst found under the tongue, formed when the duct leading from a salivary or mucous gland is obstructed and distended.

rapamycin n. see sirolimus.

raphe n. a line, ridge, seam, or crease in a tissue or organ, especially the line that marks the junction of two embryologically distinct parts that have fused to form a single structure in the adult. For example, the raphe of the tongue is the furrow that passes down the centre of the dorsal surface of the tongue.

rarefaction n. thinning of bony tissue sufficient to cause decreased density of bone to X-rays, as in osteoporosis.

rash n. a temporary eruption on the skin, usually typified by discrete red spots or generalized reddening, that may be accompanied by itching. A rash may be a local skin reaction or the outward sign of a disorder affecting the body. Rashes commonly occur with infectious diseases, such as chickenpox and measles.

Rasmussen’s encephalitis a focal encephalitis, found most commonly in children, that results in continual focal seizures (see epilepsy). The underlying cause is unknown but it may be due to a viral infection or an autoimmune process. Patients who are unresponsive to medical (antiepileptic) therapy may undergo surgery of the abnormal brain to try and control the seizures. [G. L. Rasmussen (20th century), US anatomist]

raspatory n. a filelike surgical instrument used for scraping the surface of bone (see illustration).

A rib raspatory.





raspberry tumour an *adenoma of the umbilicus.

rat-bite fever (sodokosis) a disease, contracted from the bite of a rat, due to infection by either the bacterium Spirillum minus, which causes ulceration of the skin and recurrent fever, or by the fungus Streptobacillus moniliformis, which causes inflammation of the skin, muscular pains, and vomiting. Both infections respond well to penicillin.

Rathke’s pouch see craniopharyngioma.

rationalization n. (in psychology) the explanation of events or behaviour in terms that avoid giving the true reasons. For example, someone may claim to have been too tired to go to a party whereas in fact he or she was afraid of meeting new people.

rationing n. the process of allocating health-care resources among a population when demand outstrips supply. Where “first come first served” is not considered an appropriate policy, access to treatment may be rationed on a basis of *need, effectiveness, or *quality of life. See equality; justice; NICE.

rauwolfia n. the dried root of the shrub Rauwolfia serpentina, which contains several alkaloids, including reserpine. Rauwolfia and its alkaloids lower blood pressure and depress activity of the central nervous system. They were formerly used as tranquillizers and to treat hypertension, but have been replaced by more effective and reliable drugs.

Raynaud’s disease a condition of unknown cause in which the arteries of the fingers are unduly reactive and enter spasm (angiospasm or vasospasm) when the hands are cold. This produces attacks of pallor, numbness, and discomfort in the fingers. A similar condition (Raynaud’s phenomenon) may result from atherosclerosis, connective-tissue diseases, ingestion of ergot derivatives, or the frequent use of vibrating tools. Gangrene or ulceration of the fingertips may result from lack of blood to the affected part. Warm gloves and peripheral *vasodilators may relieve the condition. In unresponsive cases *sympathectomy is of value. [M. Raynaud (1834–81), French physician]

RDS see respiratory distress syndrome.

reaction formation (in psychoanalysis) a *defence mechanism by which unacceptable unconscious ideas are replaced in consciousness by their opposites. For instance, a man might make an ostentatious show of affection to someone for whom he has an unconscious hatred.

reactive adj. (in psychiatry) describing mental illnesses thought to be precipitated by events in the psychological environment. See also endogenous.

reactive arthritis an inflammatory arthritis that develops after a gastrointestinal or a genitourinary (especially a chlamydial) infection, formerly called Reiter’s syndrome. In a third of patients the triad of nongonococcal inflammation of the urethra (see urethritis), *conjunctivitis, and *polyarthritis occurs.

reactive hypoglycaemia a condition of postprandial *hypoglycaemia, of varying severity, induced by excessive levels of insulin release from the pancreas. It can be divided into early and late forms, depending on whether the insulin release occurs less than or more than three hours after the meal. The early form is due to the rapid discharge of ingested carbohydrate from the stomach into the small bowel, immediately triggering hyperinsulinaemia. It can occur without obvious cause but is most commonly associated with upper-bowel surgery. The late form is due to a loss of the early-phase insulin response causing excessive postprandial *hyperglycaemia, which then itself triggers an exaggerated insulin response with subsequent hypoglycaemia.

reagin n. a type of *antibody, formed against an allergen, that has special affinity for cell membranes and remains fixed in various tissues. Subsequent contact with the allergen causes damage to the tissues when the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. The damaged cells, particularly *mast cells, release histamine and serotonin, which are responsible for the local inflammation of an allergy or the very severe effects of anaphylactic shock (see anaphylaxis). Reagins belong to the IgE class of *immunoglobulins.

reality orientation therapy that aims to improve cognitive functioning and behaviour in elderly people with dementia by using repetition and a range of resources to help the memory. It involves regularly reminding the person of such information as the time, date, where he or she is, and planned events for that day. The information is given verbally by a carer or written on boards placed in prominent positions in the person’s home.

real-time imaging the rapid acquisition and manipulation of ultrasound information from a scanning probe by electronic circuits to enable images to be produced on TV screens almost instantaneously. The operator can place the scanning probe accurately on the region of interest in order to observe its structure and appreciate moving structures within it (see Doppler ultrasound). Using similar techniques, the instantaneous display of other imaging modalities, such as *computerized tomography scanning and *magnetic resonance imaging, can now be achieved. Real-time imaging is useful in guiding *interventional radiology procedures, for example, allowing a needle to be guided accurately as it is passed into the body. It is also useful for observing dynamic physiological activity.

reamer n. an instrument used in *endodontics to clean, cut, and prepare the walls of a root canal for *root canal treatment.

rebase n. see reline.

rebound n. the return or increase of a condition after cessation of treatment or other stimulus. Rebound headache, which may be worse than the initial headache, may occur after stopping medication, particularly if too much was taken. Similarly, rebound insomnia may occur after the cessation of sleeping pills, particularly after long-term treatment.

reboxetine n. an *antidepressant drug that acts by inhibiting reabsorption of the neurotransmitter *noradrenaline, thus prolonging its action in the brain. Side-effects include dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, and dizziness.

receptaculum n. the dilated portion of a tubular anatomical part. The receptaculum (or cisterna) chyli is the dilated end of the *thoracic duct, into which lymph vessels from the lower limbs and intestines drain.

receptor n. 1. a cell or group of cells specialized to detect changes in the environment and trigger impulses in the sensory nervous system. All sensory nerve endings act as receptors, whether they simply detect touch, as in the skin, or chemical substances, as in the nose and tongue, or sound or light, as in the ear and eye. See exteroceptor; interoceptor; mechanoreceptor; proprioceptor. 2. a specialized area of a cell membrane, consisting of a specially adapted protein, that can bind with a specific hormone (e.g. *oestrogen receptors), neurotransmitter (e.g. *adrenoceptors), drug, or other chemical, thereby initiating a change within the cell.

recess n. (in anatomy) a hollow chamber or a depression in an organ or other part.

recessive adj. describing a gene (or its corresponding characteristic) whose effect is shown in the individual only when its *allele is the same, i.e. when two such alleles are present (the double recessive condition). Many hereditary diseases (including cystic fibrosis) are due to the presence of a defective gene as a double recessive. They are said to show autosomal recessive inheritance, since the gene is carried on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome). Compare dominant. —recessive n.

recipient n. a person who receives something from a *donor, such as a blood transfusion or a kidney transplant.

recombinant DNA DNA that contains genes from different sources that have been combined by the techniques of *genetic engineering rather than by breeding experiments. Genetic engineering is therefore also known as recombinant DNA technology.

record linkage the means by which information about health events from several different sources (e.g. hospital attendance, vaccination, and consultation with general practitioners) are all related to a specific individual in a common file or more usually a computerized record. This contrasts with data in which events only are recorded (see Hospital Episode Statistics) and two individuals treated for the same disease cannot be distinguished from one individual treated on two separate occasions.

recovery position a first-aid position into which an unconscious but breathing patient can be laid to afford maximum protection to the airway. It involves laying the patient on his or her side, with the uppermost leg bent at the knee and hip and the lower arm behind the back to prevent rolling onto the front or back into a position in which the patient could smother or choke.

recrudescence n. a fresh outbreak of a disorder in a patient after a period during which its signs and symptoms had died down and recovery seemed to be taking place.

recruitment n. 1. (in physiology) the phenomenon whereby an increase in the strength of a stimulus or repetition of the stimulus will stimulate increasing numbers of nerve cells to respond. 2. (in audiology) the phenomenon in which a person with sensorineural deafness cannot hear quiet sounds but can perceive loud sounds just as loudly as, or even more loudly than, a person with normal hearing.

rect- (recto-) combining form denoting the rectum. Examples: rectouterine (relating to the rectum and uterus); rectovesical (relating to the rectum and bladder).

rectal bleeding see haematochesia.

rectocele (proctocele) n. bulging or pouching of the rectum, usually a forward protrusion of the rectum into the posterior wall of the vagina often in association with prolapse of the uterus. It is repaired by posterior *colporrhaphy.

rectopexy n. a surgical procedure to prevent or treat rectal prolapse. An abdominal rather than a perineal approach is used. The rectum is mobilized into its normal pelvic position and internally fixed to the sacrum and anterior structures using sutures and mesh. Rectopexy may be combined with the removal of a small section of large bowel (resection rectopexy).

rectosigmoid n. the region of the large intestine around the junction of the sigmoid colon and the rectum.

rectum n. the terminal part of the large *intestine, about 12 cm long, which runs from the sigmoid colon to the anal canal. Faeces are stored in the rectum before defecation. —rectal adj.

rectus n. any of several straight muscles. The rectus muscles of the orbit are some of the extrinsic *eye muscles. Rectus abdominis is a long flat muscle that extends bilaterally along the entire length of the front of the abdomen. The rectus muscles acting together serve to bend the trunk forwards; acting separately they bend the body sideways. The rectus femoris forms part of the *quadriceps.

recurrent adj. (in anatomy) describing a structure, such as a nerve or blood vessel, that turns back on its course, forming a loop.

recurrent miscarriage see miscarriage.

red blood cell see erythrocyte.

redia n. (pl. rediae) the third-stage larva of a parasitic *fluke. Rediae develop within the body of a freshwater snail and undergo a process of asexual reproduction, giving rise to many fourth-stage larvae called *cercariae. See also miracidium; sporocyst.

red reflex the red area seen through the pupil as a result of the reflection of light from the retina. It is usually seen on *fundoscopy and sometimes in photographs taken using a flashlight.

reduction n. (in surgery) the restoration of a displaced part of the body to its normal position by manipulation or operation. The fragments of a broken bone are reduced before a splint is applied; a dislocated joint is reduced to its normal seating; or a hernia is reduced when the displaced organ or tissue is returned to its usual anatomical site.

reduction division the first division of *meiosis, in which the chromosome number is halved. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for the whole of meiosis.

reduplication n. doubling of the heart sounds, which may be heard in healthy individuals and shows variation with respiration due to the slightly asynchronous closure of the heart valves.

reduviid n. any one of a group of winged insects (Reduviidae) whose mouthparts – adapted for piercing and sucking – take the form of a long proboscis that is tucked beneath the head when not in use. Some South American genera, notably Panstrongylus, Rhodnius, and Triatoma – the kissing bugs, are nocturnal bloodsucking insects that transmit the parasite causing *Chagas’ disease.

Reduvius n. a genus of predatory bloodsucking reduviid bugs. R. personatus, widely distributed in Europe, normally preys upon insects but occasionally attacks humans. Its bite causes various allergic symptoms, including rash, nausea, and palpitations.

Reed–Sternberg cell a large binucleate cell that is characteristic of *Hodgkin’s disease. [D. Reed Mendenhall (1874–1964), US pathologist; C. Sternberg (1872–1935), Austrian pathologist]

re-entry tachycardia a rapid heart rate due to a self-sustaining circulation of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles and back again. This re-entry circuit requires the presence of an abnormal second electrical conduction pathway in addition to the usual atrioventricular nodal connection route. The abnormal pathway may be located within the *atrioventricular node (causing *atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia) or it may be an *accessory pathway situated outside the atrioventricular node (causing *atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia). Medication is often effective and *radiofrequency ablation is usually curative.

refeeding syndrome a potentially fatal condition that may affect severely malnourished patients in response to the reintroduction of a protein- and calorie-rich diet. It is thought to be due to severe fluid and *electrolyte shifts (especially low phosphate, magnesium, and potassium levels in the blood) and related metabolic complications (e.g. raised levels of insulin in the blood). Clinical complications include heart failure, *paraesthesia, muscle weakness, cardiac *arrhythmias, fitting, and death. An assessment to identify at-risk patients before the reinstatement of feeding, regular monitoring, and prompt correction of electrolyte abnormalities helps to prevent this condition.

referred pain (synalgia) pain felt in a part of the body other than where it might be expected. An abscess beneath the diaphragm, for example, may cause a referred pain in the shoulder area, while heart disorders may cause pain in the left arm and fingers. The confusion arises because sensory nerves from different parts of the body share common pathways when they reach the spinal cord.

reflective practice the process of critically considering one’s own professional practice during or after events in order to review one’s values and to understand the emotions and reasons behind one’s actions and decisions and the effect of those actions and decisions on others. Reflection is seen as essential to developing and maintaining ethical medical practice. See autonomy.

reflex n. an automatic or involuntary activity brought about by relatively simple nervous circuits, without consciousness being necessarily involved. Thus a painful stimulus such as a pinprick will bring about the reflex of withdrawing the finger before the brain has had time to send a message to the muscles involved. See conditioned reflex; patellar reflex; plantar reflex; pupillary reflex; rooting reflex.

reflex arc the nervous circuit involved in a *reflex, being at its simplest a sensory nerve with a receptor, linked at a synapse in the brain or spinal cord with a motor nerve, which supplies a muscle or gland (see illustration). In a simple reflex (such as the *patellar reflex) only two neurons may be involved, but in other reflexes there may be several *interneurons in the arc.

The reflex arc.





reflexology n. a complementary therapy based on the theory that reflex points on the feet correspond with all body parts. Firm pressure is applied to the relevant reflex points using the thumb or fingers. Reflexology is said to be able to help with specific illnesses and may also restore the body’s natural balance and harmony. It can be used for people of any age and there are very few contraindications.

reflex sympathetic dystrophy see complex regional pain syndrome.

reflux n. a backflow of liquid, against its normal direction of movement. See also oesophagitis; vesicoureteric reflux.

reformatting n. in radiography, displaying the images in a different plane or multiple planes by manipulating information already obtained. Typical examples are three-dimensional reconstructions and *multiplanar reconstructions.

refraction n. 1. the change in direction of light rays when they pass obliquely from one transparent medium to another, of a different density. Refraction occurs as light enters the eye, when it passes from air to the media of the eye, i.e. cornea, aqueous humour, lens, and vitreous humour, to come to a focus on the retina. Errors of refraction, in which light rays do not come to a focus on the retina due to defects in the refracting media or shape of the eyeball, include astigmatism and long- and short-sightedness. 2. determination of the power of refraction of the eye. This gives the degree to which the eye differs from normal, which will determine whether or not the patient needs glasses and, if so, how strong they should be.

refractive error an abnormality of the eye resulting in a blurred image on the retina as a result of abnormal focusing, which can be corrected by glasses, contact lenses, or *refractive surgery. Refractive errors include *myopia, *hypermetropia, and *astigmatism.

refractive surgery any surgical procedure that has as its primary objective the correction of any refractive error. It includes such procedures as clear lens extraction, *LASIK, *LASEK, and photorefractive *keratectomy.

refractometer n. see optometer.

refractory adj. unresponsive: applied to a condition that fails to respond satisfactorily to a given treatment.

refractory period (in neurology) the time of recovery needed for a nerve cell that has just transmitted a nerve impulse or for a muscle fibre that has just contracted. During the refractory period a normal stimulus will not bring about excitation of the cell, which is undergoing *repolarization.

refrigeration n. lowering the temperature of a part of the body to reduce the metabolic activity of its tissues or to provide a local anaesthetic effect.

Refsum’s disease an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism resulting in abnormal accumulation of phytanic acid (a fatty acid) in body tissues. This results in a *peripheral neuropathy affecting the sensory and motor nerves, diminishing vision due to *retinitis pigmentosa, and unsteadiness (*ataxia) caused by damage to the cerebellum. [S. Refsum (20th century), Norwegian physician]

regimen n. (in therapeutics) a prescribed systematic form of treatment, such as a diet, course of drugs, or special exercises, for curing disease or improving health.

regional specialty see catchment area.

registrar n. see consultant.

regression n. (in psychiatry) reversion to a more immature level of functioning. The term may be applied to the state of a patient in hospital who becomes incontinent and demanding. It may also be applied to a single psychological function; for example, psychoanalysts speak of the *libido regressing to an early stage of development.

regulations pl. n. explicit rules to govern behaviour that are enforced by specified institutions or agencies. Where regulations are breached, the relevant regulatory authority can impose sanctions. Regulations may derive from legislation, from professional bodies, or from a designated authority.

regulatory T cell (Treg cell) a type of T *lymphocyte that suppresses immune responses.

regurgitation n. 1. the bringing up of undigested material from the stomach to the mouth (see vomiting). 2. the flowing back of a liquid in a direction opposite to the normal one, as when blood surges back through a defective valve in the heart after the heart has contracted (see aortic regurgitation; mitral regurgitation).

rehabilitation 1. (in *physical medicine) the treatment of an ill, injured, or disabled patient with the aim of restoring normal health and function or to prevent the disability from getting worse. 2. any means for restoring the independence of a patient after diseases or injury, including employment retraining.

Reifenstein’s syndrome (partial androgen insensitivity syndrome) a congenital resistance to androgen hormones (see androgen insensitivity syndrome) resulting in poor development of the male sexual characteristics, which often becomes more obvious at puberty. Some features of feminization may occur (e.g. breast development). [E. C. Reifenstein (1908–75), US endocrinologist]

reiki n. a complementary therapy based on an ancient healing system rediscovered in the 20th century by a Buddhist monk. It involves a therapist putting his or her hands on or very close to a patient to boost the patient’s natural invisible energy fields (reiki means ‘universal life force’). It is often used as an adjunct to other therapies and is said to be helpful for many conditions.

reimplantation n. see replantation.

reinforcement n. (in psychology) the strengthening of a conditioned reflex (see conditioning). In classical conditioning this takes place when a conditioned stimulus is presented at the same time as – or just before – the unconditioned stimulus. In operant conditioning it takes place when a pleasurable event (or reinforcer), such as a reward, follows immediately after some behaviour. The reinforcement schedule governs how often and when such behaviour is rewarded. Different schedules produce different effects on behaviour.

Reinke’s oedema swelling of the vocal folds of the larynx due to a build-up of fluid in Reinke’s space, between the internal fibromuscular layer of the vocal fold and its overlying mucosa. It is caused by smoking, vocal overuse, *gastro-oesophageal reflux, or thyroid disease. [F. B. Reinke (1862–1919), German anatomist]

Reissner’s membrane the membrane that separates the scala vestibuli and the scala media of the *cochlea of the ear. [E. Reissner (1824–78), German anatomist]

Reiter’s syndrome see reactive arthritis. [H. Reiter (1881–1969), German physician]

rejection n. (in transplantation) the destruction by immune mechanisms of a tissue grafted from another individual. Antibodies, complement, clotting factors, and platelets are involved in the failure of the graft to survive. *Allograft rejection is a vigorous response that can be modified by drugs (such as ciclosporin and corticosteroids) and antibodies against T cells; *xenograft rejection is an acute response that is at present beyond therapeutic control.

relapse n. a return of disease symptoms after recovery had apparently been achieved or the worsening of an apparently recovering patient’s condition during the course of an illness.

relapsing fever an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus *Borrelia, which is transmitted by ticks or lice and results in recurrent fever. The first episode of fever occurs about a week after infection: it is accompanied by severe headache and aching muscles and joints and lasts 2–8 days. Subsequent attacks are milder and occur at intervals of 3–10 days; untreated, the attacks may continue for up to 12 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics, such as tetracycline or erythromycin, is effective.

relative analgesia a sedation technique, used particularly in dentistry, in which a mixture of *nitrous oxide and oxygen (‘gas and air’) is given. The patient remains conscious throughout; the technique is used to supplement local anaesthesia for nervous patients.

relative density see specific gravity.

relativism n. the view that ethical judgments are solely or mainly determined by the cultural, social, or psychological perspectives of those making them. In medical ethics, this often takes the form of cultural relativism, whereby it is assumed that because health-care traditions and practices vary, so too must definitions of what constitutes good practice. Compare Kantian ethics.

relaxant n. an agent that reduces tension and strain, particularly in muscles (see muscle relaxant).

relaxation n. (in physiology) the diminution of tension in a muscle, which occurs when it ceases to contract: the state of a resting muscle.

relaxation therapy treatment by teaching patients to decrease their anxiety by reducing the tone in their muscles. This can be used by itself to help people cope with stressful situations or as a part of *desensitization to specific fears.

relaxin n. a hormone, secreted by the placenta in the terminal stages of pregnancy, that causes the cervix (neck) of the uterus to dilate and prepares the uterus for the action of *oxytocin during labour.

Relenza n. see zanamivir.

reline (rebase) n. the procedure by which the fitting surface of a denture is rebased to make it fit a jaw that has undergone *resorption since the denture was originally made. The procedure is often necessary for dentures that were fitted immediately after extraction of the teeth.

REM rapid eye movement: describing a stage of *sleep during which the muscles of the eyeballs are in constant motion behind the eyelids. People woken up during this stage of sleep generally report that they were dreaming at the time.

Remicade n. see infliximab.

remission n. 1. a lessening in the severity of symptoms or their temporary disappearance during the course of an illness. 2. a reduction in the size of a cancer and the symptoms it is causing.

remittent fever see fever.

renal adj. relating to or affecting the kidneys.

renal artery either of two large arteries arising from the abdominal aorta and supplying the kidneys. Each renal artery divides into an anterior and a posterior branch before entering the kidney.

renal cell carcinoma (Grawitz tumour, hypernephroma) a malignant tumour of kidney cells (the alternative name refers to its supposed resemblance to part of the adrenal gland and at one time it was thought to originate from this site). It may be present for some years before giving rise to symptoms, which include fever, loin pain and swelling, and blood in the urine. Treatment is by surgery, but tumours are apt to recur locally or spread via the bloodstream and can often be seen growing along the renal vein. Secondary growths from a renal cell carcinoma in the lung have a characteristic ‘cannon-ball’ appearance. These tumours are relatively insensitive to radiotherapy and cytotoxic drugs but some respond to such hormones as progestogens. Targeted therapy with *sorafenib and *sunitinib has significantly changed the treatment of advanced tumours.

renal function tests tests for assessing the function of the kidneys. These include measurements of the specific gravity of urine, creatinine *clearance time, and blood urea levels; intravenous urography; and renal angiography.

renal osteodystrophy see osteodystrophy.

renal transplantation see transplantation.

renal tubular acidosis (RTA) metabolic acidosis due to failure of the kidney to excrete acid into the urine. Three types of RTA are recognized. Type 1 (distal RTA) results from a reduction in net acid secretion in the distal convoluted tubule (see nephron) and an inability to acidify the urine. Hypokalaemia is often present and may be severe. The condition can be either genetically determined or, more commonly, the result of systemic disease (e.g. autoimmune disorders) or drugs (e.g. amphotericin). Type II (proximal RTA) is due to a lowered threshold for bicarbonate reabsorption; eventually a steady state is established with a low serum bicarbonate but capacity to acidify the urine. Hypokalaemia is present due to *aldosteronism caused by the increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. Proximal RTA usually occurs as part of more widespread proximal tubule dysfunction with the *Fanconi syndrome. Type IV RTA results from impaired excretion of both acid and potassium and results in acidosis with hyperkalaemia. It is most commonly seen with aldosterone deficiency. This may be isolated, especially in diabetics, or it may be induced by drugs (angiotensin II antagonists or ACE inhibitors).

renal tubule (uriniferous tubule) the fine tubular part of a *nephron, through which water and certain dissolved substances are reabsorbed back into the blood.

reni- (reno-) combining form denoting the kidney.

renin n. an enzyme released into the blood by the kidney in response to stress. It reacts with a substrate from the liver to produce *angiotensin, which causes constriction of blood vessels and thus an increase in blood pressure. Excessive production of renin results in the syndrome of *renovascular hypertension.

rennin n. an enzyme produced in the stomach that coagulates milk. It is secreted by the gastric glands in an inactive form, prorennin, which is activated by hydrochloric acid. Rennin converts caseinogen (milk protein) into insoluble casein in the presence of calcium ions. This ensures that the milk remains in the stomach, exposed to protein-digesting enzymes, for as long as possible. The largest amounts of rennin are present in the stomachs of young mammals.

renography (isotope renography) n. the radiological study of the kidneys by a *gamma camera following the intravenous injection of a radioactive *tracer, which is concentrated and excreted by the kidneys. The radioactive isotope (usually *technetium-99m) emits gamma rays, which are recorded by the camera positioned over the kidneys. A graph of the radioactivity in each kidney over time provides information on its function and rate of drainage. See DMSA; DTPA; MAG3.

renovascular hypertension disease affecting the arterial supply to the kidneys, leading to ischaemia and resultant stimulation of the renin-*angiotensin-aldosterone axis. In the major vessels, the most common cause is atheromatous plaque disease. Other causes are fibromuscular dysplasia and *Takayasu’s disease.

reovirus n. one of a group of small RNA-containing viruses that infect both respiratory and intestinal tracts without producing specific or serious diseases (and were therefore termed respiratory enteric orphan viruses). Compare echovirus.

repaglinide n. see meglitinides.

reperfusion n. restoration of blood flow to a tissue that follows relief of an arterial occlusion, most commonly following the correction of acute coronary artery occlusion by coronary *stenting or *thrombolysis in the context of heart attack.

repetitive strain injury (RSI) pain in an upper limb associated with frequent repetition of a particular movement, usually related to keyboard usage. Symptoms often occur in the absence of clear signs, such as *tenosynovitis or *tendovaginitis, which presents difficulties both in treatment and in claiming compensation from an employer (if an industrial cause can be identified).

repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) see transcranial magnetic stimulation.

replacement bone a bone that is formed by replacing cartilage with bony material.

replantation n. 1. the reattachment of severed limbs (or parts of limbs) and other body parts (e.g. the nose) using *microsurgery to rejoin nerves and vessels. 2. (reimplantation) (in dentistry) the reinsertion of a tooth into its socket after its accidental or deliberate removal. The prognosis for the tooth is improved if the tooth is not allowed to dry out prior to reimplantation. —replant vb.

replication n. the process by which *DNA makes copies of itself when the cell divides. The two strands of the DNA molecule unwind and each strand directs the synthesis of a new strand complementary to itself (see illustration).

Replication of a DNA molecule.





repolarization n. the process in which the membrane of a nerve cell returns to its normal electrically charged state after a nerve impulse has passed. During the passage of a nerve impulse a temporary change in the molecular structure of the membrane allows a surge of ions across the membrane (see action potential). During repolarization ions diffuse back to restore the charge and the nerve becomes ready to transmit further impulses. See refractory period.

repositor n. an instrument used to return a displaced part of the body – for instance, a prolapsed uterus – to its normal position.

repression n. (in *psychoanalysis) the process of excluding an unacceptable wish or an idea from conscious mental life. The repressed material may give rise to symptoms. One goal of psychoanalysis is to return repressed material to conscious awareness so that it may be dealt with rationally.

reproduction rate see fertility rate.

reproductive system the combination of organs and tissues associated with the process of reproduction. In males it includes the testes, vasa deferentia, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, urethra, and penis; in females it includes the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva. (See illustration.)

Male reproductive system.





Female reproductive system.





research ethics committee see ethics committee.

resection n. surgical removal of a portion of any part of the body. For example, a section of diseased intestine may be removed and the healthy ends sewn together. A submucous resection is removal of part of the cartilage septum (central division) of the nose that has become deviated, usually by injury. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) – an operation performed when the prostate gland becomes enlarged – involves removal of portions of the gland through the urethra using an instrument called a *resectoscope.

resectoscope n. a type of surgical instrument (an *endoscope) used in resection of the prostate or in the removal of bladder tumours. The resectoscope allows continuous irrigation of the operation site during the procedure by having a fluid inlet and outlet channel. Resection is performed by an electrically activated wire loop.

reserpine n. see rauwolfia.

reserve volume the extra volume of air that an individual could inhale or exhale when breathing to the limit of his or her capacity.

resident n. in the USA, a licensed physician or surgeon in postgraduate training in a particular specialty, who is responsible for the care of a number of hospital patients with the assistance of *interns, whom he or she instructs. A resident may work with one or more senior surgeons or physicians.

residual volume the volume of air that remains in the lungs after the individual has breathed out as much as he or she can. This volume is increased in *emphysema.

resistance n. 1. the degree of *immunity that the body possesses: a measure of its ability to withstand disease. 2. the degree to which a disease or disease-causing organism remains unaffected by antibiotics or other drugs.

resolution n. 1. the stage during which inflammation gradually disappears. 2. the degree to which individual details can be distinguished by the eye, as through a *microscope.

resorption n. loss of substance through physiological or pathological means. In dentistry, internal resorption occurs from within the pulp cavity; apical resorption occurs at the root end. Resorption of the jaws occurs following tooth removal.

respiration n. the process of gaseous exchange between an organism and its environment. This includes both external respiration, which involves *breathing, in which oxygen is taken up by the capillaries of the lung *alveoli and carbon dioxide is released from the blood, and internal respiration, during which oxygen is released to the tissues and carbon dioxide absorbed by the blood. Blood provides the transport medium for the gases between the lungs and tissue cells. In addition, it contains a pigment, *haemoglobin, with special affinity for oxygen. Once inside the cell oxygen is utilized in metabolic processes resulting in the production of energy (see ATP), water, and waste materials (including carbon dioxide). See also lung. —respiratory adj.

respirator n. 1. a face mask for administering oxygen or other gas or for filtering harmful fumes, dust, etc. 2. see ventilator.

respiratory arrest cessation of breathing, which – without treatment – will very quickly be followed by *cardiac arrest. It may result from airway obstruction, brain or spinal injury, overdose of certain medications (e.g. opioids), disease of the muscles and/or nerves necessary for breathing, or severe lung disease or injury. Treatment must be prompt and include clearance of any blockage in the airway and ventilatory support, for example by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

respiratory distress severe difficulty in achieving adequate oxygenation in spite of significant efforts to breathe: it is usually associated with increased *respiratory rate and the use of *accessory muscles in the chest wall. It can occur in both obstructive and nonobstructive lung conditions. See adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway obstruction; dyspnoea; respiratory distress syndrome; stridor.

respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; hyaline membrane disease) the condition of a newborn infant in which the lungs are imperfectly expanded. Initial inflation and normal expansion of the lungs requires the presence of a substance (*surfactant) that reduces the surface tension of the air sacs (alveoli) and prevents collapse of the small airways. Without surfactant the airways collapse, leading to inefficient and ‘stiff’ lungs. The condition is most common and serious among preterm infants, in whom surfactant may be deficient. It lasts 5–10 days, with worsening on days 2–3. Breathing is rapid, laboured, and shallow, and microscopic examinations of lung tissue in fatal cases has revealed the presence of *hyalin material in the collapsed air sacs. The condition is treated by careful nursing, intravenous fluids, and oxygen, with or without positive-pressure ventilation (see noninvasive ventilation). Early surfactant replacement therapy has been shown to reduce the severity of RDS and when given prophylactically it has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcome. See also adult respiratory distress syndrome.

respiratory quotient (RQ) the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide transferred from the blood into the alveoli to the volume of oxygen absorbed into the alveoli. The RQ is usually about 0.8 because more oxygen is taken up than carbon dioxide excreted.

respiratory rate (RR) breathing rate: the number of breaths per minute. Normally between 6 and 12, it increases after exercise and in cases of *respiratory distress and decreases after head injury and opioid overdosage.

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) a paramyxovirus (see myxovirus) that causes infections of the nose and throat. It is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. In tissue cultures infected with the virus, cells merge together to form a conglomerate (syncytium). RSV is thought to have a role in *sudden infant death syndrome. Vulnerable children can be treated with *ribavirin, but most children just require supportive measures.

respiratory system the combination of organs and tissues associated with *breathing. It includes the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs and also the diaphragm and other muscles associated with breathing movements.

response n. the way in which the body or part of the body reacts to a *stimulus. For example, a nerve impulse may produce the response of a contraction in a muscle that the nerve supplies.

response prevention a form of *behaviour therapy given for severe *obsessions. Patients are encouraged to abstain from rituals and repetitive acts while they are in situations that arouse anxiety. For example, a hand-washing ritual might be treated by stopping washing while being progressively exposed to dirt. The anxiety then declines, and with it the obsessions.

responsibility n. the state or position of being accountable for one’s actions and decisions. In health care, responsibility for some matters may be delegated to a less experienced clinician but overall responsibility remains with the senior. At the same time, responsibility for personal health is with the individual, an approach underlined by *dependence agencies (such as Alcoholics Anonymous). Best health care in practice acknowledges this mutuality or partnership: the physician is an expert in medicine, the patient in him- or herself. See also professionalism.

restenosis n. recurrent *stenosis, usually in a blood vessel after such procedures as angioplasty or insertion of a stent.

restiform body a thick bundle of nerve fibres that conveys impulses from tracts in the spinal cord to the cortex of the anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum.

resting cell a cell that is not undergoing division. See interphase.

restless legs syndrome (Ekbom’s syndrome) a condition in which a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, and itching, often accompanied by twitching and pain, is felt in the calves of the legs when sitting or lying down, especially in bed at night. The only relief is walking or moving the legs, which often leads to insomnia. The cause is unknown: it may be inadequate circulation, nerve damage (see peripheral neuropathy), deficiency of iron, vitamin B12, or folate, or a reaction to antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs. In severe cases treatment with a *dopamine receptor agonist (e.g. pramipexole) may be helpful.

restoration n. (in dentistry) any type of dental *filling or *crown, which is aimed at restoring a tooth to its normal form, function, and appearance. A sealant restoration (or preventive resin restoration) is a combination of a *fissure sealant and a small filling.

rest pain pain without prior exertion, usually experienced in the feet or chest (*angina pectoris), that indicates an extreme degree of *ischaemia.

restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease) an enzyme, obtained from bacteria, that cuts DNA into specific short segments. Restriction enzymes are widely used in *genetic engineering.

resuscitation n. the restoration of a person who appears to be dead by the revival of cardiac and respiratory function. See cardiopulmonary resuscitation; mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. See also advance directive, decision, or statement; DNAR order.

resuscitation mannikin a life-size model of a person for practising all aspects of basic and advanced life support, including endotracheal *intubation and *defibrillation.

retainer n. (in dentistry) 1. the component of a partial *denture that keeps it in place. 2. an *orthodontic appliance that holds the teeth in position at the end of active treatment. 3. the component of a *bridge that is fixed to a natural tooth.

retardation n. the slowing up of a process. Psychomotor retardation is a marked slowing down of activity and speech, which can reach a degree where a patient can no longer care for him- or herself. It is a symptom of severe *depression.

retching n. repeated unavailing attempts to vomit.

rete n. a network of blood vessels, nerve fibres, or other strands of interlacing tissue in the structure of an organ. The rete testis is a network of tubules conducting sperm from the seminiferous tubules of the *testis to the vasa efferentia.

retention n. 1. inability to pass urine, which is retained in the bladder. The condition may be acute and painful or chronic and painless. Acute urinary retention (AUR) can be precipitated by surgery, urinary infection, constipation, and drugs; spontaneous AUR is usually caused by enlargement of the prostate gland in men, although many other conditions may result in obstruction of bladder outflow. Retention is relieved by catheter drainage of the bladder, after which the underlying problem is dealt with. See also intermittent self-catheterization. 2. the ability to store events in memory. If retention is impaired because of a storage defect, the person affected will have difficulty retrieving memories. This is a feature of *dementia.

reteplase n. see fibrinolytic; tissue-type plasminogen activator.

reticular activating system the system of nerve pathways in the brain concerned with the level of consciousness – from the states of sleep, drowsiness, and relaxation to full alertness and attention. The system integrates information from all of the senses and from the cerebrum and cerebellum and determines the overall activity of the brain and the autonomic nervous system and patterns of behaviour during waking and sleeping.

reticular fibres microscopic, almost nonelastic, branching fibres of *connective tissue that join together to form a delicate supportive meshwork around blood vessels, muscle fibres, glands, nerves, etc. They are composed of a collagen-like protein (reticulin) and are particularly common in lymph nodes, the spleen, liver, kidneys, and muscles.

reticular formation a network of nerve pathways and nuclei throughout the *brainstem, connecting motor and sensory nerves to and from the spinal cord, the cerebellum and the cerebrum, and the cranial nerves. It is estimated that a single neuron in this network may have synapses with as many as 25,000 other neurons.

reticulin n. a protein that is the major constituent of *reticular fibres.

reticulocyte n. an immature red blood cell (erythrocyte). Reticulocytes may be detected and counted by staining living red cells with certain basic dyes that result in the formation of a blue precipitate (reticulum) within the reticulocytes. They normally comprise about 1% of the total red cells and are increased (reticulocytosis) whenever the rate of red cell production increases.

reticulocytosis n. an increase in the proportion of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the bloodstream. It is a sign of increased output of new red cells from the bone marrow.

reticuloendothelial system (RES) a community of cells – *phagocytes – spread throughout the body. It includes *macrophages and *monocytes. The RES is concerned with defence against microbial infection and with the removal of worn-out blood cells from the bloodstream. See also spleen.

reticulosis n. abnormal overgrowth, usually malignant, of any of the cells of the lymphatic glands or the immune system. See lymphoma; Hodgkin’s disease; Burkitt’s lymphoma; mycosis fungoides.

reticulum n. a network of tubules or blood vessels. See endoplasmic reticulum; sarcoplasmic reticulum.

retin- (retino-) combining form denoting the retina. Example: retinopexy (fixation of a detached retina).

retina n. the light-sensitive layer that lines the interior of the eye. The outer part of the retina (retinal pigment epithelium; RPE), next to the *choroid, is pigmented to prevent the passage of light. The inner part, next to the cavity of the eyeball, contains *rods and *cones (light-sensitive cells) and their associated nerve fibres (see illustration). A large number of cones is concentrated in a depression in the retina at the back of the eyeball called the *fovea. —retinal adj.

The structure of the retina.





retinaculum n. (pl. retinacula) a thickened band of tissue that serves to hold various tissues in place. For example, flexor retinacula are found over the flexor tendons in the wrist and ankle.

retinal 1. (retinene) n. the aldehyde of retinol (*vitamin A). See also rhodopsin. 2. adj. see retina.

retinal artery occlusion blockage of arterial blood supply to the retina, usually as a result of *thrombosis or *embolism. The central retinal artery enters the eye at the optic disc and then divides into branches to supply different parts of the retina. Blockage of the central retinal artery (central retinal artery occlusion) usually results in sudden painless loss of vision. Blockage of one of the branches of the central retinal artery (branch retinal artery occlusion) results in *ischaemia of the retina supplied by the occluded vessel and related visual field loss.

retinal detachment (detached retina) separation of the inner nervous layer of the *retina from the outer pigmented layer (retinal pigment epithelium, RPE). It commonly occurs when a break (hole or tear) allows fluid from the vitreous cavity of the eyeball to accumulate under the retina (rhegmatogenous) but can also occur when fluid accumulates by leakage from the RPE (nonrhegmatogenous). Vision is lost in the affected part of the retina. The retina can be reattached by surgical means, such as external *plombage or internal *vitrectomy, or by creating patches of scar tissue between the retina and the choroid by application of extreme cold (see cryosurgery) or heat (see photocoagulation).

retinal dialysis separation of the retina from its insertion at the ora serrata (the anterior margin of the retina, lying just posterior to the ciliary body). This acts as a retinal tear and causes a *retinal detachment.

retinal vein occlusion blockage of a vein carrying blood from the retina. Small branch veins carry blood from different parts of the retina and drain into the central retinal vein, which leaves the eye at the optic disc. Blockage of the central retinal vein (central retinal vein occlusion) usually results in sudden painless reduction of vision. Distended veins, haemorrhages, and *cotton-wool spots are seen in the retina and the optic disc may become swollen. Blockage of a branch of the central retinal vein (branch retinal vein occlusion) results in painless reduction of vision in the affected area, where engorged veins, haemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots may be seen.

retinene n. see retinal.

retinitis n. inflammation of the retina caused mainly by viral infection; for example, *cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, HIV retinitis. In practice, the term is often used for noninflammatory conditions; for example, *retinitis pigmentosa. For such conditions the term *retinopathy is becoming more widely used.

retinitis pigmentosa a hereditary condition characterized by progressive degeneration of the *retina due to malfunctioning of the retinal pigment epithelium. It starts in childhood with *night blindness and limited peripheral vision and may progress to complete loss of vision. Progression and visual function are both extremely variable, depending on the type of retinitis pigmentosa.

retinoblastoma n. a rare malignant tumour of the retina, occurring mainly in developing retinal cells in children usually under the age of two years.

retinoid n. any one of a group of drugs derived from vitamin A. They bind to one or more of six specific receptors that are found on many cells. On the skin they act to cause drying and peeling and a reduction in oil (sebum) production. These effects can be useful in the treatment of severe *acne, *psoriasis, *ichthyosis, and other skin disorders. Retinoids include *isotretinoin, *tretinoin, acitretin, tazarotene, and alitretinoin, which is particularly effective for hyperkeratotic hand eczema. Possible side-effects, which may be serious, include severe fetal abnormalities (if taken by pregnant women), toxic effects on babies (if taken by breastfeeding mothers), liver and kidney damage, excessive drying, redness and itching of the skin, and muscle pain and stiffness.

retinol n. see vitamin A.

retinopathy n. any of various disorders of the retina resulting in impairment or loss of vision. It is usually due to damage to the blood vessels of the retina, occurring (for example) as a complication of longstanding diabetes (diabetic retinopathy), high blood pressure, or AIDS (AIDS retinopathy). In diabetic retinopathy, haemorrhaging or exudation may occur, either from damaged vessels into the retina or from new abnormal vessels (see neovascularization) into the vitreous humour. The later stages require laser treatment (see photocoagulation). In the UK all people with diabetes are screened using annual digital retinal photography. The warning signs of potentially sight-threatening retinal changes can be spotted and referral to a specialist eye clinic made for further assessment and intervention to prevent a deterioration in vision. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), formerly known as retrolental fibroplasia, is the abnormal growth of developing retinal blood vessels seen in premature infants. It may be mild and resolve spontaneously or severe enough to lead to blindness if untreated.

retinopexy n. any surgical procedure used to repair a *retinal detachment. See pneumoretinopexy; cryoretinopexy.

retinoschisis n. splitting of the layers of the neurosensory retina with accumulation of fluid between the layers. This is usually static or it may progress very slowly compared to other types of *retinal detachment.

retinoscope n. an instrument used to determine the power of spectacle lens required to correct *refractive errors of the eye. It is held in the hand and casts a beam of light into the subject’s eye. The examiner looks along the beam and sees the reflection in the subject’s pupil. By interpreting the way the reflection moves as the instrument is moved, and by altering this by lenses held in the other hand near the subject’s eye, the examiner is able to determine the degree of refractive error. —retinoscopy n.

retinotomy n. a surgical incision into the retina.

retraction n. 1. (in obstetrics) the state of uterine muscle fibres remaining shortened after contracting during labour. This results in a gradual progression of the fetus downwards through the pelvis. The basal portion of the uterus becomes thicker and pulls up the dilating cervix over the presenting part. 2. (in dentistry) the drawing back of one or more teeth into a better position by an *orthodontic appliance. 3. (in dentistry) the stretching of facial tissues to expose only the teeth during dental photography.

retraction ring a depression in the uterine wall marking the junction between the actively contracting muscle fibres of the upper segment of the uterus and the muscle fibres of the lower segment. This depression is not always visible and is normal. In obstructed labour (e.g. contracted pelvis or malposition of the fetus resulting in shoulder presentation), the muscle fibres of the upper segment become shorter and thicker; the muscle fibres of the lower segment, on the other hand, become elongated and thinner. The junction between the two becomes more distinct as it rises into the abdomen from the pelvis. This abnormal ring is known as Bandl’s ring and is a sign of impending rupture of the lower segment of the uterus, which becomes progressively thinner as Bandl’s ring rises upwards. Immediate action to relieve the obstruction is then necessary, usually in the form of Caesarean section.

retractor n. a surgical instrument used to expose the operation site by drawing aside the cut edges of skin, muscle, or other tissues. There are several types of retractors for different operations (see illustration).

Retractors.





retro- prefix denoting at the back or behind. Examples: retrobulbar (at the back of the eyeball); retroperitoneal (behind the peritoneum).

retrobulbar neuritis (optic neuritis) inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eye, causing increasingly blurred vision. When the inflammation involves the first part of the nerve and can be seen at the optic disc, it is called optic papillitis. Retrobulbar neuritis is one of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis but it can also occur as an isolated lesion, in the absence of any other involvement of the nervous system, with the patient recovering vision completely.

retroflexion n. the bending backward of an organ or part of an organ, especially the abnormal bending backward of the upper part of the uterus (i.e. the part furthest from the cervix). Compare anteflexion.

retrograde adj. going backwards, or moving in the opposite direction to the normal. (See pyelography.) Retrograde amnesia is a failure to remember events immediately preceding an illness or injury. Compare antegrade.

retrograde root canal treatment see apicectomy.

retrolental fibroplasia see retinopathy.

retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) a condition in which a dense plaque of fibrous tissue develops behind the peritoneum adjacent to the abdominal aorta. It may be secondary to malignancy, medication (methysergide, beta blockers), aortic aneurysm, or certain infections. The ureters become encased and hence obstructed, causing acute *anuria and renal failure. The obstruction can be relieved by *nephrostomy or the insertion of double J *stents. In the acute phase steroid administration may help, but in established RPF *ureterolysis is required.

retroperitoneal space the region between the posterior parietal *peritoneum and the front of the *lumbar vertebrae. It contains important structures, including the kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, lumbar spinal nerve roots, sympathetic ganglia and nerves, and the abdominal *aorta and its major branches.

retropharyngeal space the region behind the *pharynx and in front of the bones of the neck. Infection in this space can result in a retropharyngeal abscess.

retropulsion n. a compulsive tendency to walk backwards. It is a symptom of *parkinsonism.

retrospective study 1. a review of the characteristics of a group of individuals, some of whom have a specific disease or condition, to investigate possible causes by comparing affected and unaffected individuals in terms of past experience. See also case control study. 2. see cohort study.

retroversion n. an abnormal position of the uterus in which it is tilted backwards, with the base lying in the *pouch of Douglas, against the rectum, instead of on the bladder. It occurs in about 20% of women. Compare anteversion.

retrovirus n. an RNA-containing virus that can convert its genetic material into DNA by means of the enzyme *reverse transcriptase, which enables it to become integrated into the DNA of its host’s cells. Retroviruses have been implicated in the development of some cancers and are associated with conditions characterized by an impaired immune system (*HIV is a retrovirus). They are also used as *vectors in gene therapy.

retrusion n. (in dentistry) 1. backward displacement of the lower jaw (mandible). 2. a malocclusion in which some of the teeth are further back than usual. Compare protrusion.

Rett’s syndrome a disorder affecting young girls, in which stereotyped movements (see stereotypy) and social withdrawal appear during early childhood. Intellectual development is often impaired and special educational help is needed. The condition is inherited as an X-linked (see sex-linked) dominant characteristic. [A. Rett (1924–97), Austrian paediatrician]

revalidation n. the process by which licensed doctors are required to demonstrate to the *General Medical Council on a regular basis that they are up to date and fit to practise medicine. Revalidation aims to give extra confidence to patients that their doctor is being regularly checked by their employer and the GMC. Revalidation started in the UK in December 2012. Licensed doctors usually have to revalidate every five years, by having regular annual appraisals based on the GMC’s core guidance for doctors. Only doctors who have a licence to practise are required to revalidate. See licensing. See also clinical governance.

revascularization n. 1. the regrowth of blood vessels following disease or injury so that normal blood supply to an organ, tissue, or part is restored. 2. the restoration of blood flow to an organ by *angioplasty/*stenting or surgical *bypass grafting. See coronary revascularization.

reverse transcriptase an enzyme, found mainly in *retroviruses, that catalyses the synthesis of DNA from RNA. It enables the viral RNA to be integrated into the host DNA. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are antiviral drugs that inhibit this process; they include *zidovudine and *didanosine, used in the treatment of HIV infection; and lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil, for treating HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B.

Revlimid n. see lenalidomide.

Reye’s syndrome a rare disorder occurring in childhood. It is characterized by the symptoms of *encephalitis combined with evidence of liver failure. Often, the symptoms develop in the apparent recovery phase of a viral infection. Treatment is aimed at controlling cerebral *oedema and correcting metabolic abnormalities in order to allow spontaneous recovery, but there is still a significant mortality and there may be residual brain damage. The cause is not known, but *aspirin has been implicated and this drug should not be used in children below the age of 16 unless specifically indicated. [R. D. K. Reye (1912–77), Australian histopathologist]

RFA see radiofrequency ablation.

rhabdomyolysis n. the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle cells, with the release of myoglobin and other potentially toxic cell components. Blood levels of *creatine kinase are raised. It can result in *hyperkalaemia, *hypovolaemia, *myoglobinuric acute renal failure, and *disseminated intravascular coagulation. Causes include muscle trauma and crush injury, alcohol abuse, seizures, and medications (notably statins).

rhabdomyoma n. a rare benign tumour of skeletal muscle or heart muscle.

rhabdomyosarcoma n. a rare malignant tumour, usually of childhood, originating in, or showing the characteristics of, striated muscle. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma occurs in late middle age, in the muscles of the limbs. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, affecting infants, children, and young adults, are classified as botryoid (in the vagina (see sarcoma botryoides), bladder, ear, etc.), embryonal (most common in the head and neck, particularly the orbit); and alveolar (at the base of the thumb). The pleomorphic and alveolar types respond poorly to treatment; botryoid tumours are treated with a combination of radiotherapy, surgery, and drugs. The embryonal type, if treated at an early stage, can often be cured with a combination of radiotherapy and drugs (including vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide).

rhagades pl. n. cracks or long thin scars in the skin, particularly around the mouth or other areas of the body subjected to constant movement. The fissures around the mouth and nose of babies with congenital syphilis eventually heal to form rhagades.

rhegmatogenous adj. resulting from a break or tear in the retina. For example, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment results as a consequence of a tear in the retina.

rheo- combining form denoting 1. a flow of liquid. 2. an electric current.

rhesus factor (Rh factor) a group of *antigens that may or may not be present on the surface of the red blood cells; it forms the basis of the rhesus blood group system. Most people have the rhesus factor, i.e. they are Rh-positive. People who lack the factor are termed Rh-negative. Incompatibility between Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood is an important cause of blood transfusion reactions and *haemolytic disease of the newborn. See also blood group.

rhesus prophylaxis see anti-D immunoglobulin; haemolytic disease of the newborn.

rheumatic fever (acute rheumatism) a disease affecting mainly children and young adults that arises as a delayed complication of infection of the upper respiratory tract with haemolytic streptococci (see Streptococcus). The main features are fever, arthritis progressing from joint to joint, reddish circular patches on the skin, small painless nodules formed on bony prominences such as the elbow, abnormal involuntary movements of the limbs and head (Sydenham’s *chorea), and inflammation of the heart muscle, its valves, and the membrane surrounding the heart. The condition may progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease, with scarring and chronic inflammation of the heart and its valves leading to heart failure, murmurs, and damage to the valves. The initial infection is treated with antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) and bed rest, with aspirin to relieve the joint pain. Following an acute attack, long-term prophylaxis with penicillin is often recommended to prevent a relapse. Rheumatic fever is now rare in developed countries.

rheumatism n. any disorder in which aches and pains affect the muscles and joints. See rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatic fever; osteoarthritis; gout.

rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of *arthritis (after *osteoarthritis). It typically involves the joints of the fingers, wrists, feet, and ankles, with later involvement of the hips, knees, shoulders, and neck. It is a disease of the synovial lining of joints; the joints are initially painful, swollen, and stiff and are usually affected symmetrically. As the disease progresses the ligaments supporting the joints are damaged and there is erosion of the bone, leading to deformity of the joints. Tendon sheaths can be affected, leading to tendon rupture. Onset can be at any age, and there is a considerable range of severity. Women are at greater risk. Rheumatoid arthritis is an *autoimmune disease, and most patients show the presence of rheumatoid factor or other antibodies in their serum. There are characteristic changes on X-ray. In the early stages there is soft tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis; late stages are characterized by marginal bony erosions, narrowing of the articular space, articular destruction, and joint deformity.

Treatment is with a variety of drugs, including anti-inflammatory analgesics (see NSAID), corticosteroids, *disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and *biological therapies. Surgical treatment is by excision of the synovium in early cases or by *fusion or joint replacement once bony changes have occurred. (See also hip replacement.) The condition may resolve spontaneously, but is usually relapsing and remitting with steady progression. It may finally burn itself out, leaving severely deformed joints.

rheumatology n. the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis and management of disease involving joints, tendons, muscles, ligaments, and associated structures. See also physical medicine. —rheumatologist n.

rhinitis n. inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose. It may be caused by virus infection (acute rhinitis; see cold) or an allergic reaction (allergic rhinitis; see hay fever). In atrophic rhinitis the mucous membrane becomes thinned and fragile. In perennial (or vasomotor) rhinitis there is overgrowth of, and increased secretion by, the membrane.

rhinolith n. a stone (calculus) in the nose, usually formed around a foreign body.

rhinology n. the branch of medicine concerned with disorders of the nose and nasal passages.

rhinomycosis n. fungal infection of the lining of the nose.

rhinorrhoea n. a persistent watery mucous discharge from the nose, as in the common cold.

rhinoscleroma n. the formation of nodules in the interior of the nose and *nasopharynx, which become thickened. It is caused by bacterial infection (with Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis).

rhinoscopy n. examination of the interior of the nose using a speculum or endoscope.

rhinosinusitis n. inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Rhinosinusitis is a common condition caused by allergies, infection, immune deficiencies, *mucociliary transport abnormalities, trauma, drugs, or tumours. Various classifications exist. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012 defined acute rhinosinusitis as lasting up to 12 weeks and chronic rhinosinusitis as lasting 12 or more weeks. Subgroups of the latter include chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Treatment may require steroids (topical or systemic), antibiotics, immunotherapy, or *endoscopic sinus surgery. See rhinitis; sinusitis.

rhinosporidiosis n. an infection of the mucous membranes of the nose, larynx, eyes, and genitals that is caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi and is characterized by the formation of tiny *polyps. It occurs most commonly in Asia.

rhiz- (rhizo-) combining form denoting a root. Example: rhizonychia (the root of a nail).

rhizotomy n. a surgical procedure in which selected nerve roots are cut at the point where they emerge from the spinal cord. In posterior rhizotomy the posterior (sensory) nerve roots are cut for the relief of intractable pain in the organs served by these nerves. An anterior rhizotomy – the cutting of the anterior (motor) nerve roots – is sometimes done for the relief of severe muscle spasm or *dystonia.

Rhodnius n. a genus of large bloodsucking bugs (see reduviid). R. prolixus is important in the transmission of *Chagas’ disease in Central America and the northern part of South America.

rhodopsin (visual purple) n. a pigment in the retina of the eye, within the *rods, consisting of retinal – an aldehyde of retinol (*vitamin A) – and a protein. The presence of rhodopsin is essential for vision in dim light. It is bleached in the presence of light and this stimulates nervous activity in the rods.

rhombencephalon n. see hindbrain.

rhomboid n. either of two muscles (rhomboid major and rhomboid minor) situated in the upper part of the back, between the backbone and shoulder blade. They help to move the shoulder blade backwards and upwards.

rhonchus n. (pl. rhonchi) an abnormal musical noise produced by air passing through narrowed bronchi. It is heard through a stethoscope, usually when the patient breathes out.

rhythm method a contraceptive method in which sexual intercourse is restricted to the safe period at the beginning and end of the *menstrual cycle. The safe period is calculated either on the basis of the length of the menstrual cycle or by reliance on the change of body temperature that occurs at ovulation. A third possible indicator (see Billings method) is the change that occurs with ovulation in the stickiness of the mucus at the neck (cervix) of the uterus. The method depends for its reliability on the woman having uniform regular periods and its failure rate is higher than with mechanical methods, approaching 25 pregnancies per 100 woman-years.

RI reference intake (see Dietary Reference Values).

rib n. a curved, slightly twisted, strip of bone forming part of the skeleton of the thorax, which protects the heart and lungs. There are 12 pairs of ribs. The head of each rib articulates with one of the 12 thoracic vertebrae of the backbone; the other end is attached to a section of cartilage (see costal cartilage). The first seven pairs – the true ribs – are connected directly to the sternum by their costal cartilages. The next three pairs – the false ribs – are attached indirectly: each is connected by its cartilage to the rib above it. The last two pairs of ribs – the floating ribs – end freely in the muscles of the body wall. Anatomical name: costa.

ribavirin n. an antiviral drug effective against a range of DNA and RNA viruses, including the herpes group, *respiratory syncytial virus, and *hepatitis C. Possible side-effects include breathing difficulty, bacterial pneumonia, and *pneumothorax (when inhaled) and haemolytic anaemia (with oral treatment); it also antagonizes the action of *zidovudine against HIV.

riboflavin n. see vitamin B2.

ribonuclease n. an enzyme, located in the *lysosomes of cells, that splits RNA at specific places in the molecule.

ribonucleic acid see RNA.

ribose n. a pentose sugar (i.e. one with free carbon atoms) that is a component of *RNA and several coenzymes. Ribose is also involved in intracellular metabolism.

ribosome n. a particle, consisting of RNA and protein, that occurs in cells and is the site of protein synthesis in the cell (see translation). Ribosomes are either attached to the *endoplasmic reticulum or free in the cytoplasm as *polysomes. —ribosomal adj.

ribozyme n. an RNA molecule that can act as an enzyme, catalysing changes to its own molecular structure (before its discovery it was assumed that all enzymes were proteins). Research into the ability of genetically engineered ribozymes to destroy the RNA of HIV (the AIDS virus) is ongoing.

Richter’s hernia a hernia that contains only part of the circumference of the wall of the intestine. There is no intestinal obstruction, but necrosis of the affected section of bowel can develop rapidly. [A. G. Richter (1742–1812), German surgeon]

ricin n. a highly toxic albumin obtained from castor-oil seeds (Ricinus communis) that inhibits protein synthesis and becomes attached to the surface of cells, resulting in gastroenteritis, hepatic congestion and jaundice, and cardiovascular collapse. It is lethal to most species, even in minute amounts (1 μg/kg body weight); it is most toxic if injected intravenously or inhaled as fine particles. Ricin is being investigated as a treatment for certain lymphomas, which depends on its delivery to the exact site of the tumour in order to avoid destruction of healthy cells (see immunotoxin).

rickets n. a disease of childhood in which the bones do not harden due to a deficiency of *vitamin D. Without vitamin D, not enough calcium salts are deposited in the bones to make them rigid: consequently, they become soft and malformed. This is particularly noticeable in the long bones, which become bowed, and in the front of the ribcage, where a characteristic rickety ‘rosary’ may become apparent. The deficiency of vitamin D may be dietary or due to lack of exposure to sunlight, which is important in the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. In the UK rickets is more common in Asian immigrant families.

Renal rickets is due to impaired kidney function causing bone-forming minerals to be excreted in the urine, which results in softening of the bones.

Sterile Ringer’s solution may be injected intravenously to treat dehydration. [S. Ringer (1835–1910), British physiologist]

ringworm (tinea) n. a fungal infection of the skin, the scalp, or the nails. Ringworm is caused by the dermatophyte fungi – species of Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton – and also affects animals, a source of infection for humans. It can be spread by direct contact or via infected materials. The lesions of ringworm may form partial or complete rings and may cause intense itching. The commonest form of ringworm is athlete’s foot (tinea pedis), which affects the skin between the toes. Another common type is ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis). There is currently an epidemic of scalp ringworm in industrialized nations spread by human-to-human contact. It targets people of African or Afro-Caribbean extraction and is caused by Trichophyton tonsurans. Ringworm also affects the groin and thighs (tinea cruris) and the skin under a beard (tinea barbae). The disease is treated with antifungal agents taken by mouth (such as itraconazole or terbinafine, especially necessary with tinea capitis or nail involvement) or applied locally (for tinea on the body).

sacrocolpopexy n. surgical treatment of *vault prolapse, which can be an abdominal or laparoscopic procedure. It involves suspending the prolapsed vaginal vault to the sacral promontory using a synthetic mesh or biological material; however, it is associated with a significant risk of haemorrhage and mesh erosion. Posterior intravaginal slingplasty (or infracoccygeal sacropexy) is a more recent technique in which a neo-uterosacral ligament (which supports the vagina) is formed. This helps to relocate the vaginal apex and restore the normal vaginal axis. The procedure appears to have similar efficacy to those currently in use but with minimal surgical morbidity.

SAD (seasonal affective disorder) a disorder marked by changes of mood at particular times of the year. Typically, with the onset of winter, there is depression, general slowing of mind and body, excessive sleeping, and overeating. These symptoms resolve with the coming of spring. The phenomenon may partly account for the known seasonal variation in suicide rates. Prevalence increases with latitude and younger people (especially women) are most likely to be affected. There is evidence that mood is related to light, which suppresses the release of the hormone *melatonin from the pineal gland. Exposure to additional light during the day may relieve symptoms.

saddle joint a form of *diarthrosis (freely movable joint) in which the articulating surfaces of the bones are reciprocally saddle-shaped. It occurs at the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.

In Britain this includes legislation, official guidance, and standards laid down by institutions and professional bodies. With its emphasis on pre-empting harm and actively promoting welfare, safeguarding takes a more holistic approach than child protection, which focuses on protecting individual children identified as suffering or likely to suffer significant harm (see child protection register). Adults in need of safeguarding may have mental-health problems, physical disability, or learning difficulties or may be elderly and frail.

safe period the days in each *menstrual cycle when conception is least likely.

salpingectomy n. the surgical removal of a Fallopian tube, most commonly carried out for removal of a tubal pregnancy (see ectopic pregnancy). The operation involving both tubes is a permanent and completely effective method of contraception (see sterilization) since it prevents the egg cells passing from the ovaries to the uterus.

salpingitis n. inflammation of a tube, most commonly applied to inflammation of one or both of the Fallopian tubes caused by bacterial infection spreading from the vagina or uterus or carried in the blood. In acute salpingitis there is a sharp pain in the lower abdomen, which may be mistaken for appendicitis, and the infection may spread to the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (see peritonitis). In severe cases the tubes may become blocked with scar tissue and the patient will be unable to conceive. The condition is treated with antibiotics and later, if necessary, by the surgical removal of the diseased tube(s).

salpingography n. *radiography of one or both Fallopian tubes after a *radiopaque substance has been introduced into them via an injection into the uterus. Standardized selective salpingography enables occluded tubes, visualized by salpingography, to be restored to patency by means of tubal *catheterization.

salpingolysis n. a surgical operation carried out to restore patency to blocked Fallopian tubes; it involves the *division and removal of adhesions around the ovarian ends of the tubes.

salpingo-oophorectomy n. surgical removal of the Fallopian tube and ovary.

salpingo-oophoritis n. inflammation of a Fallopian tube and an ovary.

salpingostomy n. the operation performed to restore free passage through a blocked Fallopian tube. The blocked portion of the tube is removed surgically and the continuity is then restored. It is performed in women who have been sterilized previously by tubal occlusion (see sterilization) and in others whose Fallopian tubes have become blocked as a result of pelvic infection.

salt depletion excessive loss of sodium chloride (common salt) from the body. This may result from sweating, persistent vomiting or diarrhoea, or loss of fluid in wounds. The main symptoms are muscular weakness and cramps. Miners and workers in hot climates are particularly at risk, and salt tablets are often taken as a preventive measure.

Samaritans n. a British voluntary organization providing a telephone service for the suicidal and despairing. Started in 1953 by the Rev. Chad Varah in the cellars of a London church (St Stephen, Walbrook) with one telephone, it now has over 200 branches throughout the country manned by some 22,000 volunteers. It offers a free, nonprofessional, confidential, and (if required) anonymous service at all hours. Samaritans offer little advice, believing that their clients will be helped to make their own decisions by talking to someone who cares.

scabicide n. a drug that kills the mites causing *scabies.

scabies n. a skin infection caused by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is typified by severe itching (particularly at night), red papules, and often secondary infection. The female mite invades the skin to lay her eggs and the newly hatched mites pass from person to person by close prolonged contact. The intense itching represents a true allergic reaction to the mite, its eggs, and its faeces. Commonly infected areas are the penis, nipples, and the finger webs. Treatment is by application of a scabicide, usually *permethrin or *malathion, to all areas of the body from the neck down; benzyl benzoate may be used but is more irritant. All members of a family need treatment, but clothing and bedding need not be disinfested.

scaphoid fracture a fracture of the scaphoid bone in the wrist, usually caused by a fall onto the outstretched hand. There is pain and swelling in the *anatomical snuffbox and movements of the wrist and thumb are painful. If the fracture is suspected but not initially visible on X-ray, advanced imaging (a bone scan, CT scan, or MRI) is now increasingly used to confirm the diagnosis without delay. Treatment is with a cast for an undisplaced fracture and by internal fixation for a displaced fracture. Due to the anatomy of its blood supply, healing can take a long time, and a *bone graft and internal fixation may be required for non-*union.

scapul- (scapulo-) combining form denoting the scapula.

scapula n. (pl. scapulas or scapulae) the shoulder blade: a triangular bone, a pair of which form the back part of the shoulder girdle (see illustration). The spine on its dorsal (back) surface ends at the acromion process at the top of the shoulder. This process turns forward and articulates with the collar bone (*clavicle) at the acromioclavicular joint; it overhangs the glenoid fossa, into which the humerus fits to form the socket of the shoulder joint. The coracoid process curves upwards and forwards from the neck of the scapula and provides attachment for ligaments and muscles. —scapular adj.

Right scapula (dorsal surface).





scar n. a permanent mark left after wound healing. A hypertrophic scar is an abnormal raised scar that tends to settle after a year or so, as distinct from a *keloid, which is not only permanent but tends to extend beyond the original wound.

scarification n. the process of making a series of shallow cuts or scratches in the skin to allow a substance to penetrate the body. This was commonly performed during vaccination against smallpox; the vaccine was administered as a droplet left in contact with the scarified area.

scarlatina n. see scarlet fever.

scarlet fever a highly infectious disease caused by a strain of *Streptococcus bacteria that produces toxins. Symptoms begin 2–4 days after exposure and include fever, tonsillitis, and a characteristic widespread scarlet rash. The tongue is also affected; initially covered by a thick white material, it then becomes bright red (the ‘strawberry tongue’). Treatment with antibiotics shortens the course of the disease and reduces the risk of secondary complications, which include kidney and ear inflammation. Medical name: scarlatina. Compare German measles.

Schatzki (20th century), German-born US physician]

Scheuermann’s disease (adolescent kyphosis) a disorder of spinal growth in which a sequence of three or more vertebrae become slightly wedge-shaped. It arises in adolescence and usually occurs in the thoracic spine, causing poor posture, backache, fatigue, and exaggerated *kyphosis. X-ray findings include *Schmorl’s nodes. [H. W. Scheuermann (1877–1960), Danish surgeon]

Schick test a test to determine whether a person is susceptible to diphtheria. A small quantity of diphtheria toxin is injected under the skin; a patch of reddening and swelling shows that the person has no immunity and – if at particular risk – should be immunized. With safer *toxoids, this test is no longer necessary. [B. Schick (1877–1967), US paediatrician]

S. japonicum is common in the Far East; S. mansoni is widespread in Africa, the West Indies, and South and Central America; and S. haematobium occurs in Africa and the Middle East.

schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) n. a tropical disease caused by blood flukes of the genus *Schistosoma. Eggs present in the stools or urine of infected people undergo part of their larval development within freshwater snails living in water contaminated with human sewage. The disease is contracted when *cercaria larvae, released from the snails, penetrate the skin of anyone bathing in infected water. Adult flukes eventually settle in the blood vessels of the intestine (S. mansoni and S. japonicum) or the bladder (S. haematobium); the release of their spiked eggs causes anaemia, inflammation, and the formation of scar tissue. Additional intestinal symptoms are diarrhoea, dysentery, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and cirrhosis of the liver. If the bladder is affected, blood is passed in the urine and cystitis and cancer of the bladder may develop. The disease is treated with praziquantel.

schiz- (schizo-) combining form denoting a split or division.

schizogony n. a phase of asexual reproduction in the life cycle of a sporozoan (protozoan parasite) that occurs in the liver or red blood cells. The parasite grows and divides many times to form a schizont, which contains many *merozoites. The eventual release of merozoites of *Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, from the blood cells produces fever in the patient.

schizoid personality a personality characterized by solitariness, emotional coldness to others, inability to experience pleasure, lack of response to praise and criticism, withdrawal into a fantasy world, excessive introspection, and eccentricity of behaviour. See personality disorder.

schizont n. one of the stages that occurs during the asexual phase of the life cycle of a sporozoan. See schizogony.

schizonticide n. any agent used for killing *schizonts.

schizophrenia n. a severe *mental illness characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking, of contact with reality, and of emotional responsiveness. *Positive symptoms, such as *delusions and *hallucinations (especially of voices), are common, and any *Schneiderian first-rank symptoms are particularly indicative of the illness. *Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, impairment of ego boundaries, and loss of energy and initiative. Schizophrenia is diagnosed in ICD-11 only if symptoms persist for at least one month. The illness can spontaneously remit, run a course with infrequent or frequent relapses, or become chronic. The prognosis has improved with *antipsychotic drugs and with vigorous psychological and social management and rehabilitation. The many causes include genetic factors, environmental stress, and various triggering factors. —schizophrenic adj.

Schneiderian first- and second-rank symptoms symptoms of *schizophrenia first classified by German psychiatrist Kurt Schneider (1887–1967) in 1938. First-rank symptoms were considered by Schneider to be particularly indicative of schizophrenia; they include all forms of *thought alienation, *delusional perception, *passivity, and third-person auditory *hallucinations in the form of either a running commentary or voices talking about the patient among themselves. Some schizophrenic patients never exhibit first-rank symptoms or only experience them in some psychotic episodes. They may also occur in *mania. Second-rank symptoms are common symptoms of schizophrenia but also often occur in other forms of mental illness. They include *delusions of reference, paranoid and persecutory *delusions, and second-person auditory hallucinations.

Schnitzler’s syndrome a rare disorder characterized by chronic *urticaria, fever, bone or joint pain, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.

sciatica pain radiating from the buttock into the thigh, calf, and occasionally the foot. Although it is in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, sciatica is rarely due to disease of this nerve. Pain felt down the back and lateral aspect of the thigh, leg, and foot is often caused by degeneration or displacement of an intervertebral disc (see prolapsed intervertebral disc), which encroaches upon and irritates a lower lumbar or an upper sacral spinal nerve root. The onset may be sudden, brought on by an awkward lifting or twisting movement that causes a tear in the fibrous coat of the disc, or more gradual, from progressive narrowing secondary to degenerative changes in the disc. The back is often stiff and painful and there may be numbness and weakness in the leg. Bed rest will often relieve the pain but surgical treatment is occasionally necessary (see laminectomy; discectomy; microdiscectomy).

sciatic nerve the major nerve of the leg and the nerve with the largest diameter. It runs down behind the thigh from the lower end of the spine; above the knee joint it divides into two main branches, the tibial and common peroneal nerves, which are distributed to the muscles and skin of the lower leg.

SCID see severe combined immune deficiency.

scintigram n. a diagram showing the distribution of radioactive *tracer in a part of the body, produced by recording the flashes of light given off by a *scintillator as it is struck by radiation of different intensities. This technique is called scintigraphy. By scanning the body, section by section, a ‘map’ of the radioactivity in various regions is built up, aiding the diagnosis of cancer or other disorders. Such a record is known as a scintiscan. These images are now usually obtained using a *gamma camera.

scintillation counter a device to measure and record the fluorescent flashes in a *scintillator exposed to high-energy radiation.

scintillator n. a substance that produces a fluorescent flash when struck by high-energy radiation, such as beta or gamma rays. In medicine the most commonly used scintillator is a crystal of thallium-activated sodium iodide, which forms the basis of a *gamma camera. See also scintigram.

scleritis n. inflammation of the sclera (the white of the eye).

scleroderma n. thickening of the skin, either localized (see morphoea) or generalized, resulting in waxy ivory-coloured areas. Treatment is unsatisfactory, but spontaneous resolution may occur. Scleroderma is thought to be an *autoimmune disease. *Systemic sclerosis is a related multisystem disorder.

scleromalacia n. thinning of the sclera (white of the eye) as a result of inflammation. Sometimes the sclera fades away completely in an area, and the underlying dark-bluish tissue (usually the ciliary body) bulges beneath the conjunctiva. This state is known as scleromalacia perforans.

sclerosis n. hardening of tissue, usually due to scarring (fibrosis) after inflammation or to ageing. It can affect the lateral columns of the spinal cord and the medulla of the brain (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig’s disease), causing progressive muscular paralysis (see motor neuron disease). It can also occur in scattered patches throughout the brain and spinal cord (see multiple sclerosis) or in the walls of the arteries (see arteriosclerosis; atherosclerosis). See also tuberous sclerosis.

sclerotherapy n. an *interventional radiology technique in which a sclerosant is used to obliterate vascular malformations, recurrent cysts, or varicose veins. This is a substance that damages the lining of the structure into which it is injected, hardening the tissue and eventually obliterating the vessel or cavity.

Examples include the *Glasgow Coma Scale (or scoring system) and the *injury scoring system.

scoto- combining form denoting darkness.

scotoma n. (pl. scotomata) an area of abnormally less sensitive or absent vision in the visual field surrounded by normal sight, caused by abnormalities of the visual pathway. There is a normal physiological *blind spot in the visual field of each eye due to the optic disc, which is not sensitive to light.

Examples include newborn blood spot screening, cervical screening, and breast screening. The appropriateness of screening depends on the severity and *epidemiology of the disease and the efficacy and availability of treatment. Other factors to be taken into account are the safety, acceptability, cost, *sensitivity, and specificity of the test. No screening test is perfect, and all screening is associated with *false positives and *false negatives. See also genetic screening; UK National Screening.

scrofula n. *tuberculosis of lymph nodes, usually those in the neck, causing the formation of abscesses. Untreated, these burst through the skin and form running sores, which leave scars when they heal. Treatment with antituberculous drugs is effective. The disease, which is now rare in the developed world, most commonly affects young children. —scrofulous adj.

scrofuloderma n. tuberculosis of the skin in which the skin breaks down over suppurating tuberculous glands, with the formation of irregular-shaped ulcers with blue-tinged edges. Treatment is with antituberculous drugs, to which scrofuloderma responds better than *lupus vulgaris, another type of skin tuberculosis.

scrototomy n. an operation in which the scrotum is surgically explored, usually undertaken to investigate patients with probable obstructive *azoospermia.

scrotum n. the paired sac that holds the testes and epididymides outside the abdominal cavity. Its function is to allow the production and storage of spermatozoa to occur at a lower temperature than that of the abdomen. Further temperature control is achieved by contraction or relaxation of muscles in the scrotum. —scrotal adj.

scrub typhus (tsutsugamushi disease) a disease, widely distributed in SE Asia, caused by the parasitic bacterium Rickettsia tsutsugamushi and transmitted to humans through the bite of mites. Only larval mites of the genus *Trombicula are involved as vectors. Symptoms include headache, chills, high temperature (104°F), a red rash over most of the body, a cough, and delirium. A small ulcer forms at the site of the bite. Scrub typhus is treated with tetracycline and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. See also rickettsiae; typhus.

scrum-pox n. a form of *herpes simplex found in rugby players and wrestlers. It is caused by abrasive contact.

scruple n. a unit of weight used in pharmacy. 1 scruple = 1.295 g (20 grains). 3 scruples = 1 drachm.

SCUAD see severe chronic upper airway disease.

scurvy n. a disease that is caused by a deficiency of *vitamin C (ascorbic acid). It results from a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet (unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it from food). The first sign of scurvy is swollen bleeding gums, and a rash of tiny bleeding spots around the hair follicles is characteristic. This may be followed by subcutaneous bleeding and the opening of previously healed wounds. Treatment is by administering vitamin C.

SDB see sleep disordered breathing.

seasickness n. see motion sickness.

seasonal affective disorder see SAD.

seat-belt syndrome thoracic injuries that arise from violent contact with a restraining seat belt in motor vehicle accidents occurring at high speeds.

sebaceous cyst 1. a pale or flesh-coloured dome-shaped cyst that commonly occurs in adults, especially on the face, neck, or trunk. It is firm, with a central dot, and contains keratin, not sebum; such cysts are therefore more correctly referred to as epidermoid cysts. They are usually removed surgically. 2. a cyst of the sebaceous glands occurring in multiple form in a rare inherited condition, steatocystoma multiplex.

sebaceous gland any of the simple or branched glands in the *skin that secrete an oily substance, *sebum. They open into hair follicles and their secretion is produced by the disintegration of their cells. Some parts of the skin have many sebaceous glands, others few. Activity varies with age: the glands are most active at puberty.

seborrhoea n. excessive secretion of sebum by the *sebaceous glands. The glands are enlarged, especially on the nose and central face. The condition predisposes to acne and is common at puberty, usually lasting for a few years. Seborrhoea may be associated with a kind of *eczema (seborrhoeic eczema). —seborrhoeic adj.

sebum n. the oily substance secreted by the *sebaceous glands and reaching the skin surface through small ducts that lead into the hair follicles. Sebum provides a thin film of fat over the skin, which slows the evaporation of water; it also has an antibacterial effect.

second n. the *SI unit of time, equal to the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This unit is now the basis of all time measurements. Symbol: s.

secondary care health care provided by hospital clinicians for patients whose *primary care was provided by the *general practitioner or other health professional who first assessed, diagnosed, or treated the patient. Secondary care cannot be accessed directly by patients. For example, a general practitioner who assesses a patient with an unusual skin condition may refer the patient to a dermatologist, who then becomes the source of secondary care. Compare tertiary care.

secondary prevention the avoidance or alleviation of disease by early detection and appropriate management. Secondary prevention approaches include population *screening tests that identify disease in asymptomatic people, enabling timely treatment; and *thrombolysis in people who have had a heart attack (*myocardial infarction) or ischaemic *stroke. See also preventive medicine; primary prevention; tertiary prevention.

secondary sexual characteristics the physical characteristics that develop after puberty as a result of sexual maturation. In boys they include the growth of facial and pubic hair and the breaking of the voice. In girls they include the growth of pubic hair and the development of the breasts.

secretion n. 1. the process by which a gland isolates constituents of the blood or tissue fluid and chemically alters them to produce a substance that it discharges for use by the body or excretes. The principal methods of secretion – *apocrine, *holocrine, and *merocrine – are illustrated in the diagram. 2. the substance that is produced by a gland.

Methods of secretion.





secretor n. a person in whose saliva and other body fluids are found traces of the water-soluble A, B, or O agglutinogens that determine *blood group.

section 1. n. (in surgery) the act of cutting (the cut or division made is also called a section). For example, an abdominal section is performed for surgical exploration of the abdomen (see laparotomy). A transverse section is a cut made at right angles to a structure’s long axis. See also Caesarean section. 2. n. (in imaging) a three-dimensional reconstruction of body scans obtained by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. These are reconstituted as transverse, sagittal, and coronal plane sections. 3. n. (in microscopy) a thin slice of the specimen to be examined under a microscope. 4. vb. (in psychiatry) to issue an order for the compulsory admission of a patient to a psychiatric hospital for assessment and/or treatment of a mental disorder under the appropriate provision or section of the *Mental Health Act 1983 as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007. There are formal procedures, such as review and right to appeal, to ensure this legislation is not abused. A patient who otherwise has *capacity may still consent to or refuse treatment for conditions unrelated to the mental disorder for which he or she is detained.

section 30 order (parental order) a court order made under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 that enables a married couple to be regarded as the legal parents of a child born to a *surrogate mother commissioned by that couple. Application must be made within six months of the child’s birth and the child’s home must be with the husband and wife at the time of the application.

section 47 removal a section of the National Assistance Act 1948 that enables a local authority to arrange for the compulsory removal to a place of care of a person who is unwilling to go voluntarily from his or her own home. Individuals who are suffering from a grave chronic disease, or are physically incapacitated, or are living in insanitary conditions because of old age or infirmity can be removed if they are unable to care for themselves and do not receive care and attention from others. A public health consultant and another registered medical practitioner (usually the patient’s general practitioner) must certify that removal is in the interests of the patient or that it would prevent injury to the health of, or serious nuisance to, other people.

sedation n. the production of a restful state of mind, particularly by the use of drugs (see sedative).

sedative n. a drug that has a calming effect, relieving anxiety and tension. Sedatives are *hypnotic drugs administered at lower doses than those needed for sleep (drowsiness is a common side-effect). See also anxiolytic.

sedimentation rate the rate at which solid particles sink in a liquid under the influence of gravity. See also ESR.

see-saw breathing a pattern of breathing seen in complete (or almost complete) airway obstruction. As the patient attempts to breathe, the diaphragm descends, causing the abdomen to lift and the chest to sink. The reverse happens as the diaphragm relaxes. It is almost always associated with use of the *accessory muscles of respiration and drawing in (recession) of the *intercostal muscles of the chest wall.

segment n. (in anatomy) a portion of a tissue or organ, usually distinguishable from other portions by lines of demarcation. For example, the uterus consists of upper and lower segments. The anterior segment of the eye is the front portion, including the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. See also somite.

Seidel sign 1. a sickle-shaped *scotoma appearing as an upward or downward extension of the blind spot. 2. a test to confirm leakage of the aqueous humour. *Fluorescein sodium dye is instilled and viewed with cobalt blue light; a bright green flow of liquid is seen at the site of the leakage.

Seip–Beradinelli syndrome see lipodystrophy. [M. Seip (20th century), Scandinavian physician; W. Beradinelli (1903–56), Argentinian physician]

Seldinger technique a method for introducing a catheter into a blood vessel or cavity. First, a needle is used to puncture the structure, then a *guidewire is passed through the needle. The needle is removed, and the catheter is introduced over the wire. The technique is used in angiography, cardiac catheterization, cannulation of large veins, and drainage of abscesses and other body cavities. [S. I. Seldinger (1921–98), Swedish radiologist]

selective (o)estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) a drug that has oestrogen-like activity in some tissues and an anti-oestrogenic effect in others, depending on the manner of its binding with the oestrogen receptors. *Tamoxifen was the first SERM to be introduced. Because of its activity as an *anti-oestrogen it is used in the treatment of breast cancer, but its oestrogenic activity may cause side-effects. *Raloxifene is used in the treatment of osteoporosis for its oestrogenic effects on bone density.

selective internal radiation therapy see radioembolization.

selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) see trabeculoplasty.

selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor see SNRI.

selenium n. a *trace element that is an essential component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which catalyses the oxidation of *glutathione by hydrogen peroxide. It thus has important *antioxidant properties. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 60 μg/day for women and 70 μg/day for men. Dietary deficiency of selenium results in *cardiomyopathy; vegetarians and vegans can be at risk of deficiency. Symbol: Se.

selenium sulphide a selenium compound with antifungal properties, used to treat *dandruff and scalp infections.

self-inflating bag a device for delivering emergency artificial ventilation by means of a tight-fitting face mask, a *laryngeal mask, or an endotracheal tube (see intubation). It consists of a stiff plastic bag, which is squeezed to deliver its gas contents into the patient’s airway; when the pressure is released, it is reinflated from the atmosphere or an attached oxygen supply. Flow into and out of the bag is controlled by a system of simple valves. With an attached oxygen supply, high concentrations of oxygen can be given.

self-limiting adj. describing a condition that runs a predicted course and is unaffected by any treatment.

sella turcica a depression in the body of the sphenoid bone that encloses the pituitary gland.

Each ejaculate may contain 300–500 million spermatozoa suspended in a fluid secreted by the *prostate gland and *seminal vesicles with a small contribution from *Cowper’s glands. It contains fructose, which provides the spermatozoa with energy, and *prostaglandins, which affect the muscles of the uterus and may therefore assist transport of the spermatozoa. —seminal adj.

semi- prefix denoting half.

semicircular canals three tubes that form part of the membranous *labyrinth of the ear. They are concerned with balance and each canal registers movement in a different plane. At the base of each canal is a small swelling (an ampulla), which contains a *crista. When the head moves the fluid (endolymph) in the canals presses on the cristae, which register the movement and send nerve impulses to the brain.

semilunar cartilage one of a pair of crescent-shaped cartilages in the knee joint situated between the femur and tibia.

semilunar valve either of the two valves in the heart situated at the origin of the aorta (see aortic valve) and the pulmonary artery (see pulmonary valve). Each consists of three flaps (cusps), which maintain the flow of blood in one direction.

seminal analysis analysis of a specimen of semen, which should be obtained after five days of abstinence from coitus, in order to assess male fertility. Normal values are as follows: volume of ejaculate: 2–6.5 ml; liquefaction complete in 30 minutes; sperm concentration: 20–200 million spermatozoa per ml (sperm count refers to the total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate); motility: 60% moving progressively at 30 minutes to 3 hours; abnormal forms: less than 20%. Analysis of three separate specimens is necessary before confirming the presence of an abnormal result.

seminal vesicle either of a pair of male accessory sex glands that open into the vas deferens before it joins the urethra. The seminal vesicles secrete most of the liquid component of *semen.

seminiferous tubule any of the long convoluted tubules that make up the bulk of the *testis.

seminoma n. a malignant tumour of the testis, appearing as a swelling, often painless, in the scrotum. It tends to occur in an older age group than the *teratomas.

senile dementia a *dementia of old age.

senna n. any of various preparations of the dried fruits of certain shrubs of the genus Cassia, used as a stimulant *laxative to relieve constipation. Side-effects do not usually occur, but severe diarrhoea may follow large doses.

sensation n. a feeling: the result of messages from the body’s sensory receptors registering in the brain as information about the environment. Messages from *exteroceptors are interpreted as specific sensations – smell, taste, temperature, pain, etc. – in the conscious mind. Messages from *interoceptors, however, rarely reach the consciousness to produce sensation.

sense n. one of the faculties by which the qualities of the external environment are appreciated – sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch.

sense organ a collection of specialized cells (*receptors), connected to the nervous system, that is capable of responding to a particular stimulus from either outside or inside the body. Sense organs can detect light (the eyes), heat, pain, and touch (the skin), smell (the nose), and taste (the taste buds).

sensibility n. the ability to be affected by, and respond to, changes in the surroundings (see stimulus). Sensibility is a characteristic of cells of the nervous system.

sensitive adj. possessing the ability to respond to a *stimulus. The cells of the retina, for example, are sensitive to the stimulus of light and respond by sending nerve impulses to the brain. Other *receptors are sensitive to different specific stimuli, such as pressure or the presence of chemical substances.

sensitivity n. 1. (in microbiology) the degree to which a disease-causing organism responds to treatment by *antibiotics or other drugs. 2. (in preventive medicine) a measure of the reliability of a *screening test based on the proportion of people with a specific disease who react positively to the test (the higher the sensitivity the fewer *false negatives). This contrasts with specificity, which is the proportion of people free from disease who react negatively to the test (i.e. the higher the specificity the fewer the *false positives). Most screening tests operate such that if the sensitivity is increased the specificity is reduced and the proportion of false positives may rise to unacceptable proportions.

sensitization n. 1. alteration of the responsiveness of the body to the presence of foreign substances. In the development of an *allergy, an individual becomes sensitized to a particular allergen and reaches a state of hypersensitivity. The phenomena of sensitization are due to the production of antibodies. 2. (in behaviour therapy) a form of *aversion therapy in which anxiety-producing stimuli are associated with the unwanted behaviour. In covert sensitization the behaviour and an unpleasant feeling (such as disgust) are evoked simultaneously by verbal cues.

sensory adj. relating to the input division of the nervous system, which carries information from *receptors throughout the body towards the brain and spinal cord.

sensory cortex the region of the *cerebral cortex responsible for receiving incoming information relayed by sensory nerve pathways from all parts of the body. Different areas of cortex correspond to different parts of the body and to the various senses. Compare motor cortex.

sensory deprivation a major reduction in incoming sensory information. The main input sensory channels are the eyes, ears, skin, and nose. If input from all of these is blocked, there is loss of the sense of reality, distortion of time and imagined space, hallucinations, bizarre thought patterns, and other indications of neurological dysfunction. Even minimal sensory deprivation in early childhood can have a serious effect on the personality.

sensory nerve a nerve that carries information inwards, from an outlying part of the body towards the central nervous system. Different sensory nerves convey information about temperature, pain, touch, taste, etc., to the brain. Compare motor nerve.

sentinel lymph node the first lymph node to show evidence of metastasis (spread) of a malignant tumour (e.g. breast cancer) via the lymphatic system. Absence of cancer cells in the sentinel node indicates that more distal lymph nodes will also be free of metastasis. In breast cancer, the change in practice to perform axillary lymph node dissection only if the sentinel node contains metastatic tumour has reduced the risk of arm lymphoedema. Similarly, in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, the sentinel lymph node procedure is used as an alternative to neck dissection.

separation anxiety a state of distress and fear at the prospect of leaving familiar people (e.g. parents) and secure surroundings, such as is experienced by some children when they first go to school. It may be caused by insecure *attachment.

sepsis n. the putrefactive destruction of tissues by disease-causing bacteria or their toxins. Postpartum (or puerperal) sepsis, characterized by *puerperal pyrexia and other signs of serious infection (septic *shock), occurs within six weeks of childbirth. Postpartum sepsis caused by group A β–haemolytic streptococci is an important cause of maternal death in the UK.

sept- (septi-) combining form denoting 1. seven. 2. (septo-) a septum, especially the nasal septum. 3. sepsis.

septal defect a hole in the partition (septum) between the left and right halves of the heart. This abnormal communication is usually congenital due to an abnormality of heart development in the fetus, but can occasionally occur as a complication of *myocardial infarction. It may be found between the two atria (see atrial septal defect) or between the ventricles (see ventricular septal defect). A septal defect permits abnormal circulation of blood from the left side of the heart, where pressures are higher, to the right. This abnormal circulation is called a shunt and results in excessive blood flow through the lungs. *Pulmonary hypertension and *heart failure may occur with large shunts. A heart *murmur is normally present. Large defects are closed surgically or by using percutaneous catheter techniques (see atrial septal defect), but small defects do not require treatment.

septate uterus see arcuate uterus.

septic adj. relating to or affected with *sepsis.

septicaemia n. widespread destruction of tissues due to absorption of disease-causing bacteria or their toxins from the bloodstream. The term is also used loosely for any form of *blood poisoning. Compare pyaemia; sapraemia; toxaemia.

septic arthritis (pyogenic arthritis) infection in a joint. The joint is swollen, hot, and tender, and movement causes severe pain. The infecting organism (usually Staphylococcus aureus) can enter the joint via the bloodstream, from an injection or penetrating injury, or by direct spread from an adjacent area of osteomyelitis. The condition is a surgical emergency as it can lead to rapid destruction of articular cartilage, loss of joint function, and septicaemia. Treatment is by *arthrotomy or irrigation of the joint by arthroscopy, with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

septic shock see shock.

septostomy n. the creation of an opening in a dividing wall or membrane. For example, this procedure may be performed in cases of *twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Using a fine needle, a small hole is made in the membrane dividing the twins to allow amniotic fluid to flow from one twin to the other, thus equalizing the amount of fluid between them.

Septrin n. see co-trimoxazole.

septum n. (pl. septa) a partition or dividing wall within an anatomical structure. For example, the atrioventricular septum divides the atria of the heart from the ventricles. —septal adj. —septate adj.

sequestrectomy n. surgical removal of a *sequestrum.

sequestrum n. (pl. sequestra) a portion of dead bone formed in an infected bone in chronic *osteomyelitis. It is surrounded by an envelope (involucrum) of sclerotic bone and fibrous tissue and can be seen as a dense area within the bone on X-ray. It can cause irritation and the formation of pus, which may discharge through a *sinus, and is usually surgically removed (sequestrectomy).

ser- (sero-) combining form denoting 1. serum. 2. serous membrane.

serine n. see amino acid.

SERM see selective (o)estrogen receptor modulator.

seroconvert vb. to produce specific antibodies in response to the presence of an antigen (e.g. a vaccine or a virus). In HIV-positive patients seroconversion occurs within about two weeks of the initial infection. It is marked by a sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, fever, aches and pains, and fatigue. See AIDS.

serofibrinous adj. describing an exudate of serum that contains a high proportion of the protein fibrin.

serositis n. inflammation of a *serous membrane, such as the lining of the thoracic cavity (pleura). See polyserositis.

serotherapy n. the use of serum containing known antibodies (see antiserum) to treat a patient with an infection or to confer temporary passive *immunity upon a person at special risk. The use of antisera prepared in animals carries its own risks (for example, a patient may become hypersensitive to horse protein); the risk is reduced if the serum is taken from an immune human being.

serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) n. a compound widely distributed in the tissues, particularly in the blood platelets, intestinal wall, and central nervous system. Serotonin is thought to play a role in inflammation similar to that of *histamine and it is involved in the genesis of a migrainous headache. Drugs that act like serotonin are used in the treatment of migraine (see 5HT1 agonist). It also acts as a *neurotransmitter, and its levels in the brain are believed to have an important influence on mood. Drugs that prolong its effects are used as antidepressants (see SNRI; SSRI).

serotype n. a category into which material is placed based on its serological activity, particularly in terms of the antigens it contains or the antibodies that may be produced against it. Thus bacteria of the same species may be subdivided into serotypes that produce slightly different antigens. The serotype of an infective organism is important when treatment or prophylaxis with a vaccine is being considered.

serous adj. 1. relating to or containing serum. 2. resembling serum or producing a fluid resembling serum.

serous membrane (serosa) a smooth transparent membrane, consisting of *mesothelium and underlying elastic fibrous connective tissue, lining certain large cavities of the body. The *peritoneum of the abdomen, *pleura of the chest, and *pericardium of the heart are all serous membranes. Each consists of two portions: the parietal portion lines the walls of the cavity, and the visceral portion covers the organs concerned. The two are continuous, forming a closed sac with the organs essentially outside the sac. The inner surface of the sac is moistened by a thin fluid derived from blood serum, which allows frictionless movement of organs within their cavities. Compare mucous membrane.

serpiginous adj. describing a creeping or extending skin lesion, especially one with a wavy edge.

serratus n. any of several muscles arising from or inserted by a series of processes that resemble the teeth of a saw. An example is the serratus anterior, a muscle situated between the ribs and shoulder blade in the upper and lateral parts of the thorax. It is the chief muscle responsible for pushing and punching movements.

Sertoli cells cells found in the walls of the seminiferous tubules of the *testis. Compared with the germ cells they appear large and pale. They anchor and probably nourish the developing germ cells, especially the *spermatids, which become partly embedded within them. A Sertoli-cell tumour is a rare testicular tumour causing *feminization. [E. Sertoli (1842–1910), Italian histologist]

sertraline n. an antidepressant drug that acts by prolonging the action of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the brain (see SSRI). It is taken for the treatment of depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and panic disorder; side-effects may include dizziness, agitation, tremor, nausea, diarrhoea, and drowsiness.

serum (blood serum) n. the fluid that separates from clotted blood or blood plasma that is allowed to stand. Serum is essentially similar in composition to *plasma but lacks fibrinogen and other substances that are used in the coagulation process.

serum hepatitis see hepatitis.

serum sickness a reaction that sometimes occurs 7–12 days after injection of a quantity of foreign antigen and is characterized by the deposition of large immune complexes. Since the complexes are deposited in the arteries, kidneys, and joints, the symptoms are those of vasculitis, nephritis, and arthritis.

sesamoid bone an oval nodule of bone that lies within a tendon and slides over another bony surface. The patella (kneecap) and certain bones in the hand and foot are sesamoid bones.

sessile adj. (of a tumour) attached directly by its base without a peduncle (stalk).

sestamibi parathyroid scan (in *nuclear medicine) a scan that can help to localize the site of a parathyroid adenoma before surgical removal, to treat primary *hyperparathyroidism. The tracer is technetium-99m-labelled sestamibi (a small protein), which is selectively absorbed by overactive parathyroid glands.

seton n. a form of treatment in which a thread is passed through a *fistula and tied in a loop. The seton acts as a wick to drain off pus and can be tightened to open the track. This method can be used to treat high anal fistulas because it has a reduced risk of causing incontinence.

severe chronic upper airway disease (SCUAD) severe *rhinitis and *rhinosinusitis that has not been fully controlled by optimal pharmacological treatment.

severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) a rare disorder that usually manifests itself within the first three months of life by severe bacterial, fungal, and viral infection and *failure to thrive. It is due to reduced numbers of T and B *lymphocytes – white blood cells necessary for fighting infection. Some cases are caused by *adenosine deaminase deficiency. The only treatment currently available is a bone-marrow transplant, but *gene therapy offers hope for the future.

Sever’s disease *apophysitis caused by pulling at the point of insertion of the Achilles tendon into the calcaneus (heel bone), causing heel pain. [J. W. Sever (20th century), US orthopaedic surgeon]

sevoflurane n. a rapid-acting general *anaesthetic used for inducing and maintaining anaesthesia during surgery.

sexarche n. the age when a person first engages in sexual intercourse.

sex chromatin *chromatin found only in female cells and believed to represent a single X chromosome in a nondividing cell. It can be used to discover the sex of a baby before birth by examination of cells obtained by *amniocentesis or *chorionic villus sampling. There are two main kinds: (1) the Barr body, a small object that stains with basic dyes, found on the edge of the nucleus just inside the nuclear membrane; (2) a drumstick-like appendage to the nucleus in neutrophils (a type of white blood cell).

sex chromosome a chromosome that is involved in the determination of the sex of the individual. Women have two *X chromosomes; men have one X chromosome and one *Y chromosome. Compare autosome.

sex hormone any steroid hormone, produced mainly by the ovaries or testes, that is responsible for controlling sexual development and reproductive function. *Oestrogens and *progesterone are the female sex hormones; *androgens are the male sex hormones.

sex-limited adj. describing characteristics that are expressed differently in the two sexes but are controlled by genes not on the sex chromosomes, e.g. baldness in men.

sex-linked adj. describing genes (or the characteristics controlled by them) that are carried on the sex chromosomes, usually the *X chromosome. The genes for certain disorders, such as *haemophilia, are carried on the X chromosome; these genes and disorders are described as X-linked. Since most of these sex-linked genes are *recessive, men are more likely to have the diseases since they have only one X chromosome; women can carry the genes but their harmful effects are usually masked by the dominant (normal) alleles on their second X chromosome.

sexology n. the study of sexual matters, including anatomy, physiology, behaviour, and techniques.

sex ratio the proportion of males to females in a population, usually expressed as the number of males per 100 females. The primary sex ratio, at the time of fertilization, is in theory 50% male. The secondary sex ratio, found at birth, usually indicates slightly fewer girls than boys.

sex reversal on Y (SRY) see Y chromosome.

sexual abuse see child abuse; paedophilia.

sexual deviation any sexual behaviour regarded as abnormal by society. The deviation may relate to the sexual object (as in *fetishism) or the activity engaged in (for example, *paedophilia, sadism, and exhibitionism). The activity is sexually pleasurable.

The definition of what is normal varies with different cultures and over time, and treatment is appropriate only when the deviation causes suffering. For this reason the term sexual variation is now sometimes preferred. Some people may find that *counselling helps them to adjust to their deviation. Others may wish for treatment to change the deviation: *aversion therapy may be used, also *conditioning normal sexual fantasies to pleasurable behaviour. The only helpful effect of drugs is to reduce sexual drive generally.

sexually transmitted disease (STD) any disease transmitted by sexual intercourse, formerly known as venereal disease. STDs include *AIDS, *syphilis, *gonorrhoea, some *Chlamydia infections, genital *herpes, and *soft sore. The medical specialty concerned with STDs is genitourinary medicine.

Sézary syndrome a form of *cutaneous T-cell lymphoma manifested by generalized *erythroderma, *lymphadenopathy, and abnormal T lymphocytes (Sezary cells) in the blood, skin, and lymph nodes. [A. Sézary (1880–1956), French dermatologist]

SGA see small for gestational age.

SGLT-2 inhibitors a class of *oral hypoglycaemic drugs for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) plays the largest role in glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT-2 leads to an increase in the loss of glucose in the urine, a reduction in blood glucose levels, and a modest degree of weight loss over time due to the increased calorie loss. Two drugs in this class are currently licensed for use in the UK: dapagliflozin (Forxiga) and canagliflozin (Invokana).

SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) see aspartate aminotransferase.

SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) see alanine aminotransferase.

shaking palsy an archaic name for Parkinson’s disease (see parkinsonism).

shaping n. a technique of *behaviour modification used in the teaching of complex skills or in encouraging rare forms of behaviour. At first the therapist rewards actions that are similar to the desired behaviour; thereafter the therapist rewards successively closer approximations, until eventually only the desired behaviour is rewarded and thereby learned.

shared delusion see folie à deux.

S–H classification see Salter–Harris classification.

sheath n. 1. (in anatomy) the layer of connective tissue that envelops structures such as nerves, arteries, tendons, and muscles. 2. a *condom.

Sheehan’s syndrome a condition in which *amenorrhoea and infertility follow a major haemorrhage in pregnancy. It is caused by necrosis (death) of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland as a direct result of the haemorrhage reducing the blood supply to the gland. Compare Asherman syndrome. [H. L. Sheehan (20th century), British pathologist]

sheltered housing specially converted (or adapted) accommodation, designed to meet the special needs of people who are capable of a degree of self-care. A warden is generally in attendance. The extent to which meals and other services are provided on a continuous basis varies; so too in Britain does the per capita payment from the appropriate social service department.

Sheridan–Gardiner test a test for detecting visual impairment in children who are too young to be able to read the *Snellen chart. A series of cards, each marked with a single letter of a specific size, are held up at a distance of 6 metres from the child being tested. The child is provided with an identification card containing a selection of letters and is asked to point to the letter that is the same as the one on the card in the distance. The test is suitable for children between the ages of two and seven.

Shigella n. a genus of nonmotile rodlike Gram-negative bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. They ferment carbohydrates without the formation of gas. Some Shigella species are pathogenic. S. dysenteriae is associated with bacillary *dysentery.

shigellosis n. an infestation of the digestive system by bacteria of the genus Shigella, causing bacillary *dysentery.

shingles n. herpes zoster (see herpes).

shock n. the condition associated with circulatory collapse, when the arterial blood pressure is too low to maintain an adequate supply of blood to the tissues. The patient has a cold sweaty pallid skin, a weak rapid pulse, irregular breathing, dry mouth, dilated pupils, a decreased level of consciousness, and a reduced flow of urine.

Hypovolaemic shock is due to a decrease in the volume of blood, as occurs after internal or external *haemorrhage, burns, dehydration, or severe vomiting or diarrhoea. Cardiogenic shock results from reduced activity of the heart, as in coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. Shock may also be due to widespread dilatation of the blood vessels so that there is insufficient blood to fill them. This is the case in severe *sepsis (septic, bacteraemic, or toxic shock), with a resultant systemic inflammatory response associated with *disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Vasodilatation may also be caused by a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock: see anaphylaxis), overdosage with such drugs as opioids or barbiturates, or the emotional shock due to a personal tragedy or disaster (neurogenic shock). Sometimes shock may result from a combination of any of these causes, as in *peritonitis. The treatment of shock is determined by the cause.

short bowel syndrome intestinal failure that occurs when the small bowel is shortened by surgery or trauma, resulting in reduced absorption of nutrients. Some bowel adaptation does occur, but if under 200 cm of small bowel remain it is likely patients will need long-term *total parenteral nutrition.

short-sightedness n. see myopia.

short-stretch bandage a bandage that exerts low resting pressure. It is inelastic but can stretch by up to 60% of its original length and is used in the treatment of *lymphoedema and venous leg ulcers.

shoulder n. the ball-and-socket joint (see enarthrosis) between the glenoid cavity of the *scapula and the upper end (head) of the humerus. It is a common site of dislocation. The joint is surrounded by a capsule closely associated with many tendons: it is the site of many strains and inflammations (‘cuff injuries’).

shoulder dystocia a difficult birth (see dystocia) in which the anterior or, less commonly, the posterior fetal shoulder impacts on the maternal symphysis or sacral promontory. It is an obstetric emergency and is diagnosed when the shoulders fail to deliver after the fetal head and when gentle downward traction has failed. Additional obstetric manoeuvres (e.g. *McRobert’s manoeuvre) are required to release the shoulders from below the pubic symphysis. It occurs in approximately 1% of vaginal births. There are well-recognized risk factors, such as maternal diabetes and obesity and fetal *macrosomia. There can be a high *perinatal mortality rate and morbidity associated with the condition; the most common fetal injuries are to the brachial plexus, causing an *Erb’s palsy or *Klumpke’s paralysis. Maternal morbidity is also increased, particularly *postpartum haemorrhage.

shoulder girdle (pectoral girdle) the bony structure to which the bones of the upper limbs are attached. It consists of the right and left *scapulas (shoulder blades) and clavicles (collar bones).

shunt n. a passage connecting two anatomical channels or sites, thus diverting blood or other fluid (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid) from one to the other. It may occur as a congenital abnormality (as in *septal defects of the heart) or be surgically created; for example, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is created to transfer excess cerebrospinal fluid in hydrocephalus from the ventricles to the peritoneum. See also anastomosis.

shunt nephritis nephritis associated with infected indwelling shunts. The infection is usually with staphylococci (S. epidermidis) and patients present with anorexia, malaise, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. Purpura, anaemia, and hepatosplenomegaly may be found and urine analysis shows heavy proteinuria, often with a *nephrotic syndrome and haematuria. Treatment usually involves removal of the infected shunt as well as antibiotics.

sialic acid an amino sugar. Sialic acid is a component of some *glycoproteins, *gangliosides, and bacterial cell walls.

sialography n. a technique for X-ray examination of the salivary glands. A series of X-ray images is taken after introducing contrast medium through a cannula into the ducts of the *parotid or *submandibular glands in the mouth. It enables the presence of degenerative disease or stones blocking the ducts to be detected.

sialolith n. a stone (calculus) in a salivary gland or duct, most often the duct of the submandibular gland. The flow of saliva is obstructed, causing swelling and intense pain. Treatment is primarily by surgery to remove the stone or the whole gland but in a few cases *lithotripsy is used.

Siamese twins see conjoined twins.

sib n. see sibling.

sibilant adj. whistling or hissing. The term is applied to certain high-pitched abnormal sounds heard through a stethoscope.

sickle-cell disease (drepanocytosis) a hereditary blood disease that mainly affects people of African ancestry but also occurs in the Mediterranean region and reaches high frequencies in parts of Saudi Arabia and India. It occurs when the sickle-cell gene has been inherited from both parents and is characterized by the production of an abnormal type of *haemoglobin – sickle-cell haemoglobin (Hbs) – which precipitates in the red cells when the blood is deprived of oxygen, forming crystals that distort the cells into the characteristic sickle shape: this process is known as sickling. An excess of sickle cells in the circulation results in blockage of small blood vessels, producing episodes of severe pain (a sickle-cell crisis). Sickle cells are rapidly removed from the circulation, leading to anaemia and jaundice. There is no satisfactory treatment; the highest mortality is in childhood but some patients may live to an age of 60–70 years.

The carrier condition (sickle-cell trait) occurs when the defective gene is inherited from only one parent. It generally causes no symptoms but confers some protection from malaria, which accounts for the high frequency of the gene in malarious areas. If a general anaesthetic is to be given to a patient with this condition, the anaesthetist should be alerted.

sickle-cell nephropathy progressive renal disease developing in 5–8% of patients with *sickle-cell disease. Infarcts in the cortex can occur with sickle-cell crises and present with pain and haematuria. Acute or more insidious damage to the medulla will lead to a urinary concentrating defect and later to papillary necrosis and/or fibrosis. Occlusion of vessels within the glomerular capillary tuft leads to a secondary form of *focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and can present with the *nephrotic syndrome.

SIDE see Coffin–Lowry syndrome.

side-effect n. an effect produced by a drug in addition to its desired therapeutic effects. Adverse effects are often undesirable and may be harmful.

sidero- combining form denoting iron.

sideropenia n. iron deficiency. This may result from dietary inadequacy; increased requirement of iron by the body, as in pregnancy or childhood; or increased loss of iron from the body, usually due to chronic bleeding. The most important manifestation of iron deficiency is *anaemia, which is readily corrected by iron therapy.

siderosis n. the deposition of iron oxide dust in the lungs, occurring in silver finishers, arc welders, and haematite miners. Iron oxide itself is inert, but pulmonary *fibrosis may develop if fibrogenic dusts such as silica are also inhaled.

SIDS see sudden infant death syndrome.

siemens n. the *SI unit of electrical conductance, equal to the conductance between two points on a conductor when a potential difference of 1 volt between these points causes a current of 1 ampere to flow between them. Symbol: S.

sievert n. the *SI unit of dose equivalent, being the dose equivalent when the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation multiplied by the stipulated dimensionless factors is 1 J kg−1. As different types of radiation cause different effects in biological tissue a weighted absorbed dose, called the dose equivalent, is used in which the absorbed dose is modified by multiplying it by dimensionless factors stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The sievert has replaced the *rem. Symbol: Sv.

sigmoid- combining form denoting the sigmoid colon. Example: sigmoidotomy (incision into).

sigmoid colon (sigmoid flexure) the S-shaped terminal part of the descending *colon, which leads to the rectum.

sigmoid colectomy (sigmoidectomy) surgical removal of the sigmoid colon using either an open approach (see laparotomy) or *laparoscopy. It is performed for tumours, severe *diverticular disease, or for an abnormally long sigmoid colon that has become twisted (see volvulus).

sigmoidoscope n. see sigmoidoscopy.

sigmoidoscopy n. an examination of the rectum and sigmoid colon with a device (sigmoidoscope) inserted through the anus. Sigmoidoscopy can be used to identify the causes of diarrhoea and rectal bleeding, such as colitis or cancer. There are two main types of sigmoidoscopy. Rigid sigmoidoscopy utilizes a rigid sigmoidoscope, approximately 30 cm in length, to assess for anorectal disease. It can be readily performed in an outpatient clinic. The second type is flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is more commonly used and utilizes a flexible endoscope to assess the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon up to the splenic flexure.

sign n. an indication of a particular disorder that is detected by a physician while examining a patient but is not apparent to the patient. Compare symptom.

significance n. (in statistics) the degree to which an observed relationship between two test groups is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. An initial assumption is made that there is no meaningful difference between the groups or conditions under investigation (the null hypothesis). This can be tested using various statistical procedures, and a calculation that there is a probability of less than 5% (P value <0.05) is usually considered sufficient to reject the null hypothesis: the observed difference is statistically significant. Some tests are parametric, based on the assumption that observations will be distributed in a normal or Gaussian *distribution, where 95% of observations lie within two *standard deviations of the mean (Student’s t test to compare means). Nonparametric tests (Mann–Whitney U tests) make no assumptions about distribution patterns. See also standard error of the mean.

sign language (signed language) a form of communication that uses movements of the hands and other parts of the body together with facial expressions instead of sound. There are many different forms of sign language throughout the world. British Sign Language (BSL) is the form most commonly used in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, Northern Irish Sign Language (NISL), BSL, and Irish Sign Language (ISL; the most common form in Ireland) are all used.

sign of Dance (Dance’s sign, signe de Dance) a feeling of emptiness on palpation of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, which is thought to be characteristic of *intussusception. [J. B. H. Dance (1797–1832), French physician]

sildenafil n. a drug administered orally for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. By inhibiting the action of the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5, it elevates local *nitric oxide levels, causing smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow to the corpus cavernosum of the penis, which results in erection during sexual stimulation. Sildenafil is also licensed for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Side-effects include headache, facial flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, and dizziness. Because of severe adverse reactions, the drug is contraindicated in patients taking nitrate-based drugs, such as *glyceryl trinitrate. Tadalafil and vardenafil are drugs with similar actions and effects.

silicosis n. a lung disease – a form of *pneumoconiosis – produced by inhaling silica dust particles. It affects workers in hard-rock mining and tunnelling, quarrying, stone dressing, sand blasting, and boiler scaling. Silica stimulates *fibrosis of lung tissue, which produces progressive breathlessness and considerably increased susceptibility to tuberculosis.

silver nitrate a salt of silver with *astringent, *caustic, and *disinfectant properties. It is used to destroy warts and umbilical granulomas.

Silver–Russell syndrome see Russell–Silver syndrome.

simeticone (activated dimeticone) n. a silicone-based material with antifoaming properties, used in the treatment of infantile colic and also incorporated into antacid remedies.

sinistr- (sinistro-) combining form denoting left or the left side.

sino- (sinu-) combining form denoting 1. a sinus. 2. the sinus venosus.

sinoatrial node (SA node) the pacemaker of the heart: a microscopic area of specialized cardiac muscle located in the upper wall of the right atrium near the entry of the vena cava. Fibres of the SA node are self-excitatory, contracting rhythmically at around 70 times per minute. Following each contraction, the impulse spreads throughout the atrial muscle and into fibres connecting the SA node with the *atrioventricular node. The SA node is supplied by fibres of the autonomic nervous system; impulses arriving at the node accelerate or decrease the heart rate.

sinuplasty n. see balloon sinuplasty.

sinus n. 1. an air cavity within a bone, especially any of the cavities within the bones of the face or skull (see paranasal sinuses). 2. any wide channel containing blood, usually venous blood. Venous sinuses occur, for example, in the dura mater and drain blood from the brain. 3. a pocket or bulge in a tubular organ, especially a blood vessel; for example, the *carotid sinus. 4. (sinus tract) an infected blind-ending epithelium-lined tract leading from a focus of infection to the surface of the skin or a hollow organ. See pilonidal sinus.

sinus arrhythmia a normal variation in the heart rate, which accelerates slightly on inspiration and slows on expiration. It is common in young fit individuals.

sinusitis n. inflammation of one or more of the mucous-membrane-lined air spaces in the facial bones that communicate with the nose (the paranasal sinuses). It is often associated with inflammation of the nasal lining (*rhinitis) and may be acute or chronic (see rhinosinusitis). Symptoms may include pain, purulent discharge from the nose, nasal obstruction, and disturbances of the sense of smell. Many cases are self-limiting. Others require treatment with antibiotics, decongestants, or steroid nose drops. A few cases need surgery, such as sinus washouts, *antrostomy, or functional *endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

sinusoid n. a small blood vessel found in certain organs, such as the adrenal gland and liver. Large numbers of sinusoids occur in the liver. They receive oxygen-rich blood from the hepatic artery and nutrients from the intestines via the portal vein. Oxygen and nutrients diffuse through the capillary walls into the liver cells. The sinusoids are drained by the hepatic veins. See also portal system.

sinus rhythm a normal heart rhythm, usually as recorded on an electrocardiogram. The *sinoatrial node, located in the right atrium, normally functions as the natural pacemaker for the heart.

sinus venosus a chamber of the embryonic heart that receives blood from several veins. In the adult heart it becomes part of the right atrium.

siphonage n. the transfer of liquid from one container to another by means of a bent tube. The procedure is used in gastric *lavage, when the stomach is filled with water through a funnel and rubber tube, and the tube is then bent downwards to act as a siphon and empty the stomach of its contents.

Siphunculina n. a genus of flies. S. funicola, the eye fly of India, feeds on the secretions of the tear glands and in landing on or near the eyes contributes to the spread of *conjunctivitis.

Sipple’s syndrome see MENS. [J. H. Sipple (1930– ), US physician]

sirenomelia (mermaid syndrome, symmelia, sympodia) n. a rare and fatal developmental abnormality in which the legs are fused, the kidneys fail to develop, and the sacrum, bladder, and rectum are absent.

sirolimus (rapamycin) n. an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation. Sirolimus was first discovered as a product of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus in a soil sample from Rapa Nui (the Polynesian name for Easter Island), hence the alternative name. It blocks the activation of B and T lymphocytes by *interleukin 2 (IL-2).

SIRT selective internal radiation therapy: see radioembolization.

Sister Mary Joseph nodule a metastatic tumour nodule in the umbilicus that originates from a tumour in the pelvis or abdomen, particularly ovarian and stomach cancer. [Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey (1856–1939), US nurse]

sitagliptin n. see DPP-IV inhibitors.

sito- combining form denoting food.

sitz bath a hip bath in which the person is seated so that water or saline solution soaks only the hips and buttocks. Sitz baths are used to treat haemorrhoids and anal fissures (among other conditions).

SI units (Système International d’Unités) the internationally agreed system of units now in use for all scientific purposes. Based on the metre-kilogram-second system, SI units have seven base units and two supplementary units. Measurements of all other physical quantities are expressed in derived units, consisting of two or more base units. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 (Appendix 1) list the base units and the derived units having special names; all these units are defined in the dictionary.

Decimal multiples of SI units are expressed using specified prefixes; where possible a prefix representing 10 raised to a power that is a multiple of three should be used. Prefixes are listed in Table 1.3 (Appendix 1).

six-category intervention analysis a framework for exploring how care is delivered, based on the idea that there are six main styles of interaction (prescriptive, informative, confronting, cathartic, catalytic, and supportive). The analysis is widely used to help health-care professionals develop an understanding of interpersonal relationships, reflect on their own practice, and enhance their interactions with clients.

Sjögren’s syndrome an autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in a *dry mouth and dryness of the eyes. In the systemic form of the disease other glands may be affected, causing dryness of the airways, vagina, or skin, as well as the joints (producing a relatively mild form of arthritis) and muscles (which ache), and there may be tiredness and lethargy. Sjögren’s syndrome may also occur secondarily to other conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). Symptomatic treatment, including saliva and tear substitutes, is available. Patients are susceptible to dental caries. [H. S. C. Sjögren (1899–1986), Swedish ophthalmologist]

skatole (methyl indole) n. a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan, excreted in the urine and faeces.

skeletal muscle see striated muscle.

skeleton n. the rigid framework of connected *bones that gives form to the body, protects and supports its soft organs and tissues, and provides attachments for muscles and a system of levers essential for locomotion. The 206 named bones of the body are organized into the axial skeleton (of the head and trunk) and the appendicular skeleton (of the limbs). See illustration overleaf. —skeletal adj.

The skeleton.





skew deviation a neurological condition of the eyes in which one eye turns down while the other turns up. It is seen in disorders of the *cerebellum or *brainstem.

skia- combining form denoting shadow.

skier’s thumb (gamekeeper’s thumb) an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb, caused by forced abduction across the metacarpophalangeal joint, at the base of the thumb. Treatment is by splintage or, in the case of severe injuries, by surgical repair of the torn ligament ends.

skin n. the outer covering of the body, consisting of an outer layer, the *epidermis, and an inner layer, the *dermis (see illustration overleaf). Beneath the dermis is a layer of fatty tissue. The skin has several functions. The epidermis protects the body from injury and also from invasion by parasites. It also helps to prevent the body from becoming dehydrated. The combination of erectile hairs, *sweat glands, and blood capillaries in the skin form part of the temperature-regulating mechanism of the body. When the body is too hot, loss of heat is increased by sweating and by the dilation of the capillaries. When the body is too cold the sweat glands are inactive, the capillaries contract, and a layer of air is trapped over the epidermis by the erected hairs. The skin also acts as an organ of excretion (by the secretion of *sweat) and as a sense organ (it contains receptors that are sensitive to heat, cold, touch, and pain). The layer of fat that lies underneath the dermis can act as a reservoir of food and water. Anatomical name: cutis.

Section through the skin.





skin graft a portion of healthy skin cut from one area of the body and used to cover a part that has lost its skin, usually as a result of injury, burns, or operation. A skin graft is normally taken from another part of the body of the same patient (an *autograft), but occasionally skin may be grafted from one person to another as a temporary healing measure (an *allograft). The full thickness of skin may be taken for a graft (see flap) or the surgeon may use three-quarters thickness, thin sheets of skin (see split-skin graft), or a pinch skin graft. The type used depends on the condition and size of the damaged area. The skin graft may be free or attached by a *pedicle.

ski-stick injury a penetrating injury by a ski stick.

skull n. the skeleton of the head and face, which is made up of 22 bones. It can be divided into the cranium, which encloses the brain, and the face (including the lower jaw (mandible). The cranium consists of eight bones. The frontal, parietals (two), occipital, and temporals (two) form the vault of the skull (calvaria) and are made up of two thin layers of compact bone separated by a layer of spongy bone (diploë). The remaining bones of the cranium – the sphenoid and ethmoid – form part of its base. The 14 bones that make up the face are the nasals, lacrimals, inferior nasal conchae, maxillae, zygomatics, and palatines (two of each), the vomer, and the mandible. All the bones of the skull except the mandible are connected to each other by immovable joints (see suture). The skull contains cavities for the eyes (see orbit) and nose (see nasal cavity) and a large opening at its base (foramen magnum) through which the spinal cord passes. See illustration overleaf.

The skull bones (side view).





slapped cheek syndrome see erythema.

SLE systemic lupus erythematosus. See lupus erythematosus.

sleep n. a state of natural unconsciousness, during which the brain’s activity is not apparent (apart from the continued maintenance of basic bodily functions, such as breathing) but can be detected by means of an electroencephalogram (EEG). Different stages of sleep are recognized by different EEG wave patterns. Drowsiness is marked by short irregular waves; as sleep deepens the waves become slower, larger, and more irregular. This slow-wave sleep is periodically interrupted by episodes of paradoxical, or *REM (rapid-eye-movement), sleep, when the EEG pattern is similar to that of an awake and alert person. Dreaming occurs during REM sleep. The two states of sleep alternate in cycles of from 30 to 90 minutes, REM sleep constituting about a quarter of the total sleeping time.

sleep apnoea cessation of breathing during sleep, which may be obstructive, due to frustrated efforts to breathe against blocked upper airways (see obstructive sleep apnoea), or central, in which there is no evidence of any voluntary effort.

sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) see obstructive sleep apnoea.

sleep disordered breathing (SDB) abnormal patterns of respiration seen during sleep. *Obstructive sleep apnoea is the most common SDB; other types include central *sleep apnoea, such as *Cheyne–Stokes respiration.

sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis) a disease of tropical Africa caused by the presence in the blood of the parasitic protozoans *Trypanosoma gambiense or T. rhodesiense. The parasites are transmitted through the bite of *tsetse flies. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, and chills, followed later by enlargement of the lymph nodes, anaemia, and pains in the limbs and joints. After a period of several months or even years, the parasites invade the minute blood vessels supplying the central nervous system. This causes drowsiness and lethargy, and ultimately – if untreated – the patient dies. Rhodesian sleeping sickness is the more virulent form of the disease. Drugs used to treat the acute stage of the disease include eflornithine, pentamidine, and suramin; melarsoprol (a drug containing arsenic) is used after the brain is affected. Eradication of tsetse flies helps prevent spread of the infection.

sleep paralysis a terrifying inability to move or speak while remaining fully alert. It occurs in up to 60% of patients with *narcolepsy and may occur in other conditions, such as severe anxiety.

sleep-walking n. see somnambulism.

sling n. a bandage arranged to support and rest an injured limb so that healing is not hindered by activity. The most common sling is a *triangular bandage tied behind the neck to support the weight of a broken arm. The arm is bent at the elbow and held across the body.

sling procedure any of a group of surgical procedures for treating stress incontinence in women. See colposuspension; pubovaginal sling; tension-free vaginal tape.

slipped capital femoral epiphysis a condition that occurs when the upper (capital) epiphysis of the femur slips in relation to the rest of the femur. It most commonly affects older teenage boys who are overweight. The main symptoms are pain in the hip or knee and limping gait. It can be diagnosed on X-ray. Treatment usually involves surgery to stabilize the epiphysis.

slipped disc a colloquial term for a herniated intervertebral disc (see prolapsed intervertebral disc).

slippery slope argument the claim that a relatively innocuous or small first step will result in seriously harmful or otherwise undesirable consequences that will be difficult, if not impossible, to prevent. When or whether such slippery slopes exist is much argued over in medical ethics, especially in debates about *euthanasia. See also consequentialism.

slit lamp a device for providing a narrow beam of light, used in conjunction with a special microscope. It can be used to examine minutely the structures within the eye, one layer at a time.

slough n. dead tissue, such as skin, that separates from healthy tissue after inflammation or infection.

slow virus one of a group of infective disease agents that resemble *viruses in some of their biological properties but whose physical properties (e.g. sensitivity to radiation) suggest that they may not contain nucleic acid. They are now more commonly known as *prions.

SLT selective laser *trabeculoplasty.

SMA see spinal muscular atrophy.

small-bowel enema (enteroclysis) a radiological technique for examining the jejunum and ileum by passing a tube through the nose, oesophagus, and stomach into the small bowel and directly injecting *barium sulphate. Images are captured in real time as the contrast moves through the small bowel. It produces highly detailed images of the small bowel, making it particularly useful for investigating coeliac disease and Crohn’s disease, as well as strictures, tumours, and obstructions. It can be combined with X-ray imaging, CT, or MRI.

small-bowel meal (barium follow-through) a technique for examining the small bowel, often used when small-bowel enema is not tolerated. The patient swallows dilute *barium sulphate suspension and then a series of abdominal radiographs are taken. A complete examination occurs when contrast reaches the first part of the large bowel (caecum). This technique is particularly useful for investigating small-bowel *Crohn’s disease.

small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) a type of bronchial carcinoma characterized by small cells (or oat cells), small round or oval cells with darkly staining nuclei and scanty indistinct cytoplasm. Small-cell carcinoma is usually related to smoking and accounts for about one-quarter of bronchial carcinomas; it carries a poor prognosis due to early distant spread, typically to bones, liver, and brain. Treatment is primarily with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and paraneoplastic symptoms (see paraneoplastic syndrome) from *ectopic hormone production are common. Compare non-small-cell lung cancer.

small for gestational age (SGA) describing a fetus or baby that has failed to reach the size or birth weight expected for its gestational age. This may be because the fetus or baby is constitutionally small or it may be due to *intrauterine growth restriction in the fetus. In the latter case, the perinatal outcome is less favourable.

small intestinal bacterial overgrowth colonization of the small intestine with excessive concentrations of bacteria. Patients experience nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and symptoms of *malabsorption. Diagnosis is made by identifying bacteria in cultures of small bowel aspirates obtained during endoscopy or by glucose hydrogen breath testing, in which a high concentration of hydrogen in the breath after swallowing glucose indicates bacterial overgrowth. Risk factors include previous abdominal surgery, motility disorders (such as systemic sclerosis), anatomical disruption (such as diverticula, strictures, adhesions, or fistulae), diabetes mellitus, coeliac disease, and Crohn’s disease. Management involves treatment of the underlying condition, nutritional support, and cyclical antibiotics.

smallpox n. an acute infectious virus disease causing high fever and a rash that scars the skin. It is transmitted chiefly by direct contact with a patient. Symptoms commence 8–18 days after exposure and include headache, backache, high fever, and vomiting. On the third day, as the fever subsides, red spots appear on the face and spread to the trunk and extremities. Over the next 8–9 days all the spots (macules) change to pimples (papules), then to pea-sized blisters that are at first watery (vesicles) but soon become pus-filled (pustules). The fever returns, often causing delirium. On the eleventh or twelfth day the rash and fever abate. Scabs formed by drying out of pustules fall off 7–20 days later, leaving permanent scars. The patient remains infectious until all scabs have been shed. Most patients recover but serious complications, such as nephritis or pneumonia, may develop. Treatment with thiosemicarbazone is effective. An attack usually confers immunity; immunization against smallpox has now totally eradicated the disease. Medical name: variola. See also alastrim; cowpox.

smear n. a specimen of tissue or other material taken from part of the body and smeared on a microscope slide for examination. See cervical smear.

smear layer a layer of microcrystalline and organic particle debris that remains on the hard tissues of the teeth whenever they are cut. It may be important in assisting or preventing the penetration of bacteria into the dentinal tubules. The success of root canal treatment depends on the complete removal of the smear layer with a *chelating agent such as EDTA, but its presence may be useful in restorative dentistry.

smegma n. the secretion of the glands of the foreskin (*prepuce), which accumulates under the foreskin and has a white cheesy appearance. It becomes readily infested by a harmless bacterium that resembles the tubercle bacillus.

smooth muscle (involuntary muscle) muscle that produces slow long-term contractions of which the individual is unaware. Smooth muscle occurs in hollow organs, such as the stomach, intestine, blood vessels, and bladder. It consists of spindle-shaped cells within a network of connective tissue (see illustration) and is under the control of the autonomic nervous system. Compare striated muscle.

Smooth muscle cells.

Snellen chart the commonest chart used for testing sharpness of distant vision (see visual acuity). It consists of rows of capital letters, called test types (or optotypes), the letters of each row becoming smaller down the chart. The large letter at the top is of such a size that it can be read by a person with normal sight from a distance of 60 metres. A normally sighted person can read successive lines of letters from 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, and 5 metres respectively. There is sometimes a line for 4 metres. The subject sits 6 metres from the chart and one eye is tested at a time. If he can only read down as far as the 12-metre line the visual acuity is expressed as 6/12. Normally sighted people can read the 6-metre line, i.e. normal acuity is 6/6, and many people read the 5-metre line with ease. A smaller chart on the same principle is available for testing near vision. In North America the test is done at a distance of 20 feet: 20/20 vision is the same as 6/6. See also LogMAR chart. [H. Snellen (1834–1908), Dutch ophthalmologist]

snoring n. noisy breathing while asleep due to vibration of the soft palate, uvula, pharyngeal walls, or epiglottis. In children it is often associated with enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids.

social services advice and practical help with problems associated with social circumstances. Every local authority is responsible for establishing and staffing a social service department. Basic training for social work involves completing an approved degree in social work; there are also social workers with medical and psychiatric training who are seconded for work in hospitals (see hospital social worker) and specialist social workers in areas such as criminal justice. Social workers assess the eligibility of clients for such social services as care assistants and meals on wheels or refer them to the appropriate statutory or voluntary services; difficulties may sometimes arise when the hospital *catchment area is not coterminous with the local authority. In relation to mental health, social workers may obtain court orders for *compulsory admission where necessary and provide surveillance and support for those being treated at home or in designated hostel accommodation, including those discharged from hospital. (See also aftercare.) Case work involves identifying the causes of the client’s problem and, where appropriate, advising how best to correct them and/or adapt to the circumstances.

socket n. (in anatomy) a hollow or depression into which another part fits, such as the cavity in the alveolar bone of the jaws into which the root of a tooth fits. See also dry socket.

sodium n. a mineral element and an important constituent of the human body (average sodium content of the adult body is 4000 mmol). Sodium controls the volume of extracellular fluid in the body and maintains the acid-base balance. It also helps maintain electrical potentials in the nervous system and is thus necessary for the functioning of nerves and muscles. Sodium is contained in most foods and is well absorbed, the average daily intake in the UK being 8.1 g/day. The amount of sodium in the body is controlled by the kidneys. An excess of sodium leads to the condition of hypernatraemia, which often results in *oedema. This can be fatal in newborns, and is more likely to occur in formula-fed infants, particularly if the formula is made up at too high a concentration. Infants are at higher risk as they are less able to remove sodium from the body than adults. Sodium is also implicated in hypertension: a high-sodium diet is thought to increase the risk of hypertension in later life. The UK government target is for adults to consume less than 6 g/day. Symbol: Na.

sodium bicarbonate a salt of sodium that neutralizes acid and is used to treat metabolic acidosis (particularly *renal tubular acidosis) and to reduce the acidity of the urine in mild urinary-tract infections. Sodium bicarbonate is also an ingredient of many *antacid preparations and is used in the form of drops to soften earwax.

sodium channel see ion channel.

sodium chloride common salt: a salt of *sodium that is present in all tissues and is important in maintaining the *electrolyte balance of the body. Sodium chloride infusions are the basis of fluid replacement therapy after operations and for conditions associated with salt depletion, including shock and dehydration (see saline). Sodium chloride is also a basic constituent of *oral rehydration therapy and is used to irrigate the eye (e.g. for intraocular surgery) and to treat infections of the bladder (being instilled) and mouth (as a mouthwash).

somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5, a psychiatric disorder characterized by one or more chronic somatic symptoms about which patients are excessively concerned, preoccupied, or fearful, formerly called somatization disorder. These fears and behaviours cause significant distress and dysfunction, and although patients may make frequent use of health-care services, they are rarely reassured and often feel their medical care has been inadequate. The disorder can disrupt personal and family relationships and lead to unnecessary medical and surgical treatment. It is sometimes treated with *cognitive behavioural therapy, *psychotherapy, and/or *antidepressants.

somatoform disorders a group of disorders in which there is a history of repeated physical complaints with no physical basis. They include *somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder (see hypochondria).

somatomedin n. a protein hormone, produced by the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone, that stimulates protein synthesis and promotes growth. It is biochemically similar to *insulin and has some actions similar to insulin; it is therefore sometimes said to have insulin-like activity (ILA) or is referred to as insulin-like growth factor (IGF).

somatopleure n. the body wall of the early embryo, which consists of a simple layer of ectoderm lined with mesoderm. The amnion is a continuation of this structure outside the embryo. Compare splanchnopleure.

somatostatin (growth-hormone-release inhibiting hormone) a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and some extraneural tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (see islets of Langerhans), that acts to inhibit the secretion of many hormones. For example, in the pituitary gland it inhibits the release of *growth hormone (somatotrophin) and in the pancreas it suppresses secretion of insulin and glucagon. Somatostatin analogues are used to treat *acromegaly (caused by overproduction of growth hormone) and to relieve the symptoms caused by hormone-secreting neuroendocrine tumours, including *carcinoid tumours. They include lanreotide (also licensed for the treatment of thyroid tumours) and octreotide (also used to reduce vomiting in palliative care and to treat *oesophageal varices); gastrointestinal upsets (e.g. nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea) are the most common side-effects.

somatostatinoma n. a rare tumour of the *islets of Langerhans that produces excessive amounts of somatostatin. It is an example of an *apudoma. In severe cases it can cause the somatostatinoma syndrome, consisting of diabetes, gall-bladder disease, and *steatorrhoea due to malabsorption.

sonohysterography n. an examination of the uterus and Fallopian tubes using ultrasound rather than X-rays (as in *hysterosalphingography). In saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) evaluation of the endometrial cavity is augmented by the use of saline, which distends the uterine cavity separating the two layers of endometrium and creating a contrast. This can help identify intracavitary lesions (e.g. submucous *fibroids) and determine the amount of cavity distortion.

sonoplacentography n. see placentography.

soporific n. see hypnotic.

sorafenib n. a drug used in the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma and resistant thyroid cancer. It is an inhibitor of multiple kinases (see protein kinase; tyrosine kinase inhibitor), preventing the mediation of cell growth and proliferation, and blocks *vascular endothelial growth factor receptors on tumour cells, preventing new vessel formation. Side-effects include rash, diarrhoea, and hypertension.

sorbitol n. a sugar (carbohydrate) alcohol with a sweet taste, used as a substitute for cane sugar in foods suitable for diabetics since it is absorbed slowly from the intestine. Excess consumption can cause osmotic diarrhoea.

sordes pl. n. the brownish encrustations that form around the mouth and teeth of patients suffering from fevers.

sore n. a lay term for any ulcer or other open wound of the skin or mucous membranes, which may be caused by injury or infection. See also pressure sore; soft sore.

Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism) a rare inherited disorder resulting in excessive physical growth during the first 2–3 years of life. It presents in childhood with a characteristic facial appearance, a disproportionately large head, large hands and feet, abnormally widely spaced eyes (ocular *hypertelorism), developmental delay, and tall stature for age. Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and taller and heavier, stabilizing after about five years to achieve normal adult height. Most cases occur sporadically, although familial cases have been reported. [J. F. Sotos (1927– ), U.S. paediatrician]

souffle n. a soft blowing sound heard through the stethoscope, usually produced by blood flowing in vessels.

sound (in surgery) 1. n. a long rodlike instrument, often with a curved end, used to explore body cavities (such as the bladder) or to dilate *stricture(s) in the urethra or other canals. 2. vb. to explore a cavity using a sound.

spacer n. a plastic container with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole for an aerosol inhaler at the other. The dose from the inhaler is sprayed into the spacer, from which it can be inhaled without needing to coordinate breathing. It is particularly useful for babies and small children who do not have this coordination. Paediatric spacers also have a small mask that fits onto the mouthpiece of the spacer and is placed over the child’s nose and mouth. Spacers help to deliver a greater proportion of the dose to the airways while reducing the proportion absorbed into the body (which is the usual cause of unwanted side-effects)

Spanish fly the blister beetle, Lytta vesicatoria: source of the irritant and toxic chemical compound cantharidin.

sparganosis n. a disease caused by the migration of certain tapeworm larvae (see sparganum) in the tissues beneath the skin, between the muscles, and occasionally in the viscera and brain. The larvae, which normally develop in frogs and reptiles, are transferred to humans who eat the uncooked flesh of these animals or drink water contaminated with minute crustaceans infected with the tapeworm larvae. The larvae cause inflammation, swelling, and fibrosis of the tissues. Treatment of the condition, common in the Far East, involves surgical removal of the larvae.

sparganum n. the larvae of certain tapeworms, including species of *Diphyllobothrium and Spirometra, which may infect humans (see sparganosis). They are actually *plerocercoids, but the generic name Sparganum is sometimes given to them since they fail to develop into adults and definite classification of the species is not possible from the larvae alone.

spasm n. a sustained involuntary muscular contraction, which may occur either as part of a generalized disorder, such as a spastic paralysis, or as a local response to an otherwise unconnected painful condition. Carpopedal spasm affects the muscles of the hands and feet and is caused by a reduction in the blood calcium level (often transitory, as in hyperventilation). See also main d’accoucheur.

Also known as clasp-knife rigidity, it is a symptom of damage to the *pyramidal system in the brain or spinal cord. It is usually accompanied by weakness in the affected limb (see spastic paralysis). Compare rigidity.

spastic paralysis weakness of a limb or limbs associated with increased reflex activity. This results in resistance to passive movement of the limb (see spasticity). It is caused by disease affecting the nerve fibres of the *pyramidal system, which in health not only initiate movement but also inhibit the stretch reflexes to allow the movements to take place. See also cerebral palsy.

spatula n. an instrument with a blunt blade used to spread ointments or plasters and, particularly in dentistry, to mix materials. A flat spatula is used to depress the tongue during examination of the oropharynx.

Children with SEN can be supported via mainstream schools or may attend a *special school. Children identified as having SEN that cannot be met by a mainstream school should be assessed by their local authority, which may issue a statement of special educational needs. This statement describes the child and the additional help needed.

special health authority a type of NHS trust that provides services across the NHS in England, rather than in a single defined geographical area. There are four special health authorities, which exist as arms-length bodies of the Department of Health and Social Care, independent of government: *NHS Blood and Transplant, *NHS Business Services Authority, *NHS Resolution and *NHS Counter Fraud Authority.

special hospitals (secure hospitals) hospitals for the care of mentally ill patients who are also dangerous and must therefore be kept securely. The level of security can be low, medium, or high. Most (but not all) patients are there compulsorily under a hospital order made by a court according to the *Mental Health Act 1983.

special school (in Britain) an education establishment for children with *special educational needs. The identification and assessment of those needing to attend a special school may occur long before school age. Special schools exist for children with different types of need, including physical disability and hearing impairment. Special education for children with severe disabilities may start as early as two years.

SPECT scanning (single photon emission computing tomography) (in nuclear medicine) a *cross-sectional imaging technique for observing an organ or part of the body using a *gamma camera; images are produced after injecting a radioactive *tracer. The camera is rotated around the patient being scanned. Using a computer reconstruction *algorithm similar to that of a *computerized tomography scanner, multiple ‘slices’ are made through the area of interest. SPECT scanning is used particularly in cardiac nuclear medicine imaging (see MUGA scan). It differs from PET scanning in that radioactive decay gives off only a single gamma ray.

specular reflection (in *ultrasonics) the reflection of sound waves from the surface of an internal structure, which can be used to produce a picture of the surface as a sonogram (see ultrasonography). A specular reflection contrasts with vaguer diffuse echoes produced by minor differences in tissue density.

spermatocele n. a cystic swelling in the scrotum containing sperm. The cyst arises from the epididymis (the duct conveying sperm from the testis) and can be felt as a lump above the testis. Needle *aspiration of the cyst reveals a milky opalescent fluid that contains sperm. Treatment is by surgical removal.

spermatocyte n. a cell produced as an intermediate stage in the formation of spermatozoa (see spermatogenesis). Spermatocytes develop from spermatogonia in the walls of the seminiferous tubules of the testis; they are known as either primary or secondary spermatocytes according to whether they are undergoing the first or second division of meiosis.

spermatogenesis n. the process by which mature spermatozoa are produced in the testis (see illustration). *Spermatogonia, in the outermost layer of the seminiferous tubules, multiply throughout reproductive life. Some of them divide by meiosis into *spermatocytes, which produce haploid *spermatids. These are transformed into mature spermatozoa by the process of spermiogenesis. The whole process takes 70–80 days.

Spermatogenesis.





spermatogonium n. (pl. spermatogonia) a cell produced at an early stage in the formation of spermatozoa (see spermatogenesis). Spermatogonia first appear in the testis of the fetus but do not multiply significantly until after puberty. They act as stem cells in the walls of the seminiferous tubules, dividing continuously by mitosis and giving rise to *spermatocytes.

spermatorrhoea n. the involuntary discharge of semen without orgasm. Semen is usually produced by ejaculation at orgasm and does not normally discharge at other times. If, however, the mechanism of ejaculation is lost, spermatorrhoea may occur.

spermatozoon (sperm) n. (pl. spermatozoa) a mature male sex cell (see gamete). The tail of a sperm enables it to swim, which is important as a means for reaching and fertilizing the ovum (although muscular movements of the uterus may assist its journey from the vagina). See also acrosome; fertilization.

A spermatozoon.





spermaturia n. the presence of spermatozoa in the urine. Spermatozoa are occasionally seen on microscopic examination of the urine and their presence is not abnormal. If present in large numbers, the urine becomes cloudy, usually towards the end of micturition. Abnormal ejaculation into the bladder on orgasm (retrograde ejaculation) may occur after *prostatectomy or other surgical procedures or in neurological conditions that destroy the ability of the bladder neck to close on ejaculation.

sperm bank a facility that collects, freezes, and stores human sperm for future use in *artificial insemination (see cryopreservation). Sperm is donated by men who relinquish legal rights to any future child, and donors’ identities are generally unknown to recipients. In some cases, men store their sperm for their own future use if they are to undergo a medical treatment that might leave them sterile.

sperm count see seminal analysis.

spermicide n. an agent that kills spermatozoa. Creams and jellies containing chemical spermicides are used – in conjunction with a *diaphragm – as contraceptives. —spermicidal adj.

sphygmograph n. an apparatus for producing a continuous record of the pulse in one of the blood vessels, showing the strength and rate of the beats.

sphygmomanometer n. an instrument for measuring *blood pressure in the arteries. It consists of an inflatable cuff connected to a graduated scale gauge calibrated in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The cuff is applied to a limb (usually the arm) and inflated to exert pressure on a large artery until the blood flow stops. The pressure is then slowly released and, with the aid of a stethoscope to listen to the pulse, it is possible to determine both the systolic and diastolic pressures (which can be read on the scale). Automated electronic devices are increasingly used.

sphygmophone n. a device to record the heartbeat or pulse in the form of amplified sound waves played through a loudspeaker or earphones.

sphygmoscope n. a device for showing the heartbeat or pulse as a visible signal, especially a continuous wave signal on a cathode-ray tube.

The symptoms may include paralysis of the legs, incontinence, and learning disabilities from the commonly associated brain defect, *hydrocephalus. Spina bifida is associated with an abnormally high level of *alpha-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid surrounding the embryo. The condition can be diagnosed at about the 16th week of pregnancy by a maternal blood test and confirmed by amniocentesis and ultrasound. The risk of spina bifida is reduced if supplements of *folic acid are taken by women while trying to conceive and during the first three months of pregnancy. See also neural tube defects.

spina bifida occulta a defect in the bony arch of the spine that (unlike spina bifida) has a normal skin covering; there may be an overlying hairy patch. The condition is usually an incidental finding on X-ray and it is not associated with neurological involvement.

spinal accessory nerve see accessory nerve.

spinal anaesthesia 1. suppression of sensation, usually in the lower part of the body, by the injection of a local anaesthetic into the *subarachnoid space. A very fine needle is used to reduce the amount of cerebrospinal fluid that escapes as the needle penetrates the dura. The technique has complications (headache, sepsis, paraplegia). The injection site for spinal anaesthetics is most often in the lumbar region of the vertebral column, the needle being inserted between the vertebrae (anywhere between the second and fifth). The extent of the area anaesthetized depends upon the amount and strength of local anaesthetic injected. Dilute local anaesthetic solutions are used when the sensory nerves are targeted rather than the motor nerves. Spinal anaesthesia is useful in patients whose condition makes them unsuitable for a general anaesthetic, perhaps because of chest infection; to reduce the requirements for general anaesthetic drugs; or in circumstances where a skilled anaesthetist is not readily available to administer a general anaesthetic. 2. loss of sensation in part of the body as a result of injury or disease to the spinal cord. The area of the body affected depends upon the site of the lesion: the lower it is in the cord the less the sensory disability.

spinal column see backbone.

spinal cord the portion of the central nervous system enclosed in the vertebral column, consisting of nerve cells and bundles of nerves connecting all parts of the body with the brain. It contains a core of grey matter surrounded by white matter (see illustration overleaf). It is enveloped in three layers of membrane, the *meninges, and extends from the medulla oblongata in the skull to the level of the second lumbar vertebra. From it arise 31 pairs of *spinal nerves.

The spinal cord (transverse section).





spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) a hereditary condition in which cells of the spinal cord die and the muscles in the arms and legs become progressively weaker. Eventually the respiratory muscles are affected and death usually results from respiratory infection. Most affected individuals are wheelchair-bound by the age of 20 and few survive beyond the age of 30. The gene responsible has been located: in affected children it is inherited as a double *recessive. There are three forms of the disease, based on severity of the symptoms and the age at which they appear. Type 1 (infantile spinal muscular atrophy) is the most acute and aggressive form of the condition (see Werdnig–Hoffmann disease). Type 2 develops between the ages of 6 months and 2 years and type 3 (Kugelberg–Welander disease), the least severe form, appears between 2 and 17 years of age.

spinal nerves the 31 pairs of nerves that leave the spinal cord and are distributed to the body, passing out from the vertebral canal through the spaces between the arches of the vertebrae (see illustration). Each nerve has two *roots, an anterior, carrying motor nerve fibres, and a posterior, carrying sensory fibres. Immediately after the roots leave the spinal cord they merge to form a mixed spinal nerve on each side.

The spinal nerves (one side only).





spinal shock a state of *shock accompanied by temporary paralysis of the lower extremities that results from injury to the spine and is often associated with *ileus. If the spinal cord is transected, permanent motor paralysis persists below the level of spinal-cord division.

spindle n. a collection of fibres seen in a cell when it is dividing. The fibres radiate from the two ends (poles) and meet at the centre (the equator) giving a structure shaped like two cones placed base to base. It plays an important part in chromosome movement in *mitosis and *meiosis and is also involved in division of the cytoplasm.

spine n. 1. a sharp process of a bone. 2. the vertebral column (see backbone). —spinal adj.

spiral bandage a bandage wound round a part of the body, overlapping the previous section at each turn.

spiral CT scanning (helical CT scanning) a development of conventional *computerized tomography (CT) scanning in which the X-ray tube rotates continuously around the patient as he or she passes through the scanner. This allows the acquisition of images throughout a specified volume of tissue much more quickly. Since these images are digitally acquired (see digitization), *post-processing can produce images in numerous planes, without further exposure of the patient to ionizing radiation. See also multidetector computerized tomography.

spiral organ see organ of Corti.

Spirillum n. a genus of highly motile rigid spiral-shaped bacteria usually found in fresh and salt water containing organic matter. They bear tufts of flagella at one or both ends of the cell. Most species are saprophytes, but S. minus causes *rat-bite fever.

spiro- combining form denoting 1. spiral. 2. respiration.

splanchnopleure n. the wall of the embryonic gut, which consists of a layer of endoderm with a layer of mesoderm outside it. The yolk sac is a continuation of this structure. Compare somatopleure.

spleen n. a large dark-red ovoid organ situated on the left side of the body below and behind the stomach. It is enclosed within a fibrous capsule that extends into the spongy interior – the splenic pulp – to form a supportive framework. The pulp consists of aggregates of *lymphoid tissue (white pulp) within a meshwork of *reticular fibres packed with red blood cells (red pulp). The spleen is a major component of the *reticuloendothelial system, producing lymphocytes in the newborn and containing *phagocytes, which remove worn-out red blood cells and other foreign bodies from the bloodstream. It also acts as a reservoir for blood and, in the fetus, as a source of red blood cells. Anatomical name: lien. —splenic adj.

splen- (spleno-) combining form denoting the spleen. Example: splenorenal (relating to the spleen and kidney).

splenectomy n. surgical removal of the spleen. This is sometimes necessary in the emergency treatment of bleeding from a ruptured spleen and in the treatment of some blood diseases. Splenectomy in children may diminish the immune response to infections.

splenitis n. inflammation of the spleen. See also perisplenitis.

splenium n. the thickest part of the *corpus callosum, rounded and protruding backwards over the thalami, the pineal gland, and the midbrain.

splenomegaly n. enlargement of the spleen. It most commonly occurs in *malaria, *schistosomiasis, and other disorders caused by parasites; in infections; in blood disorders, including some forms of anaemia and lack of platelets (*thrombocytopenia); in *leukaemia; and in *Hodgkin’s disease. See also hypersplenism.

splenorenal anastomosis a method of treating *portal hypertension by joining the splenic vein to the left renal vein. Compare portacaval anastomosis.

splenunculus n. a small sphere of splenic tissue occurring at a site other than the spleen. Splenunculi are present in many people.

splint n. a rigid appliance (*orthosis) used to support or hold a limb or digit in position until healing has occurred. Splints can be used to treat fractures and dislocations and to assist in the healing of soft-tissue injuries.

splinter haemorrhage a linear haemorrhage below the nails, usually the result of trauma but also occurring in such conditions as subacute bacterial *endocarditis or severe rheumatoid arthritis.

split-skin graft (SSG, Thiersch’s graft) a type of skin graft in which thin partial thicknesses of skin are used to cover and heal a wound. They are removed from one site on the body, cut into narrow strips or sheets, and placed onto the wound area to be healed.

splitting n. a *defence mechanism by which people deal with an emotional conflict by viewing some people as all good and others as all bad: they fail to integrate themselves or other people into complex but coherent images. It is common in people with an *emotionally unstable personality disorder.

spondyl- (spondylo-) combining form denoting a vertebra or the spine.

spondylitis n. inflammation of the synovial joints of the backbone. Ankylosing spondylitis is a *sero-negative arthritis; 90% of cases carry the tissue-type antigen HLA-B27 (see HLA system). Ankylosing spondylitis predominantly affects young adult Caucasian males and the inflammation affects the joint capsules and their attached ligaments and tendons, principally the intervertebral joints and sacroiliac joints (see sacroiliitis). The resultant pain and stiffness are treated by analgesics (including *NSAIDs), physiotherapy, and biological *disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The disorder can lead to severe deformities of the spine (see kyphosis; ankylosis) and the hip joint, in which case surgical correction or *arthroplasty may be required.

spondyloarthropathy any *sero-negative arthritis that is characterized by the presence of the tissue-type antigen HLA-B27 (see HLA system) and the absence of rheumatoid factor. Spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing *spondylitis, *reactive arthritis, and *psoriatic arthritis.

spondylolisthesis n. a forward shift (slippage) of one vertebra upon another, due to a defect in the bone or in the joints that normally bind them together. This may be congenital or develop after injury. The vertebral displacement is most likely to occur in the lumbar (lower back) or cervical (neck) regions of the backbone. The majority of cases in which pain is present are treated with rest, analgesics, and NSAIDs. In a small minority, showing severe disability, pressure on nerve roots, or slippage of more than 50%, surgical fusion may be required.

spondylolysis n. a bony defect in a vertebra between the *lamina and the *transverse process, thought to be due to a *stress fracture and common in gymnasts.

spondylosis n. a spinal condition resulting from degeneration and flattening of the intervertebral discs in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions. Symptoms include pain and restriction of movement, and in advanced cases tingling, numbness, and weakness may develop due to pressure on nerve roots. Spondylosis produces a characteristic appearance on X-ray, including narrowing of the space occupied by the disc and the presence of *osteophytes; these features of the disease (radiological spondylosis) may not be accompanied by any signs and symptoms. Pain is relieved by analgesics, NSAIDs, and physiotherapy; painful movements are prevented by wearing a neck orthosis (when the neck region is affected) or a lumbosacral corset (for the lower spine). Very severe cases sometimes require surgical fusion.

spondylosyndesis n. surgical fusion of the intervertebral joints of the backbone.

spongiform encephalopathy any one of a group of rapidly progressive degenerative neurological diseases that include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and *kuru, *Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and *Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome in humans. In humans the spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by rapidly progressive dementia associated with myoclonic jerks (see myoclonus); on pathological examination the brains of affected individuals show a characteristic cystic degeneration. The diseases are thought to be caused by unconventional transmissible agents (see prion).

spongioblast n. a type of cell that forms in the early stages of development of the nervous system, giving rise to *astrocytes and *oligodendrocytes.

spontaneous adj. arising without apparent cause or outside aid. The term is applied in medicine to certain conditions, such as pathological fractures, that arise in the absence of outside injury; also to recovery from a disease without the aid of specific treatment.

spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) the presence of infection in the abdominal cavity without an obvious cause (see peritonitis). SBP occurs in patients with liver disease (and occasionally in those with nephrotic syndrome) due to *portal hypertension. This leads to the build-up of large volumes of peritoneal fluid (*ascites) in which infection takes hold and propagates. Patients experience fever, nausea, abdominal pain, further accumulation of ascites, and they may develop *hepatic encephalopathy with rapid deterioration. Diagnosis is made by *paracentesis culture of the ascitic fluid to confirm the presence of bacteria. Treatment includes antibiotics.

spontaneous intracranial hypotension see intracranial hypotension headache.

sporadic adj. describing a disease that occurs only occasionally or in a few isolated places. Compare endemic; epidemic.

spore n. a small reproductive body produced by plants and microorganisms. Some kinds of spores function as dormant stages of the life cycle, enabling the organism to survive adverse conditions. Other spores are the means by which the organism can spread vegetatively. See also endospore.

sporicide n. an agent that kills spores (e.g. bacterial spores). Some disinfectants that liberate chlorine are sporicides, but most other germicides are ineffective since spores are very resistant to chemical action. —sporicidal adj.

sporocyst n. the second-stage larva of a parasitic *fluke, found within the tissues of a freshwater snail. A sporocyst develops from a first stage larva (see miracidium) and gives rise either to the next larval stage (see redia) or daughter sporocysts. The latter develop directly into the final larval stage (see cercaria) without the intermediate redia stage.

sporogony n. the formation of *sporozoites during the life cycle of a sporozoan. The contents of the zygote, formed by the fusion of sex cells, divide repeatedly and eventually release a number of sporozoites. Compare schizogony.

sporotrichosis n. a chronic infection of the skin and superficial lymph nodes that is caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii and results in the formation of abscesses and ulcers. It occurs mainly in the tropics.

Sporozoa n. a group of parasitic protozoans that includes *Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. Most sporozoans do not have cilia or flagella. Sporozoan life cycles are complex and usually involve both sexual and asexual stages. Some sporozoans are parasites of invertebrates, and the parasites are passed to new hosts by means of spores. Sporozoans that parasitize vertebrates are transmitted from host to host by invertebrates, which act as intermediate hosts. For example, the mosquito Anopheles is the intermediate host of Plasmodium.

sporozoite n. one of the many cells formed as a result of *sporogony during the life cycle of a sporozoan. In *Plasmodium sporozoites are formed by repeated divisions of the contents of the *oocyst inside the body of the mosquito. The released sporozoites ultimately pass into the insect’s salivary glands and await transmission to a human host at the next blood meal.

sports injury any injury related to the practice of a sport, often resulting from the overuse and stretching of muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

sports medicine a specialty concerned with the treatment of *sports injuries and measures designed to prevent or minimize them (e.g. in the design of sports equipment).

spotted fever see meningitis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever; typhus.

sprain n. injury to a ligament, caused by sudden overstretching. As the ligament is not severed it gradually heals, but this may take several months. Sprains should be treated by cold compresses (ice-packs) at the time of injury, and later by restriction of activity.

Sprengel’s deformity a congenital abnormality of the scapula (shoulder blade), which is small and positioned high in the shoulder. It is caused by failure of the normal development and descent of this bone. [O. G. K. Sprengel (1852–1915), German surgeon]

sprue (psilosis) n. impaired absorption of food due to disease of the small intestine. Tropical sprue is seen in people from temperate regions who move to the tropics. It is characterized by diarrhoea (usually *steatorrhoea), an inflamed tongue (glossitis), anaemia, and weight loss; the lining of the small intestine becomes inflamed and atrophied, leading to vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies. Its cause is unknown, but infection is most likely. Treatment with antibiotics and *folic acid is usually effective, but the condition often improves spontaneously on return to a temperate climate. See also coeliac disease; malabsorption.

spud n. a blunt needle used for removing foreign bodies embedded in the cornea of the eye.

spur n. a sharp projection, especially one of bone.

sputum n. material coughed up from the respiratory tract. Its characteristics, including colour, consistency, volume, smell, and the appearance of any solid material within it, often provide important information affecting the diagnosis and management of respiratory disease. Pathological examination of sputum for microorganisms and for abnormal cells may add further information.

squalene n. an unsaturated hydrocarbon (a terpene), synthesized in the body, from which *cholesterol is derived.

squama n. (pl. squamae) 1. a thin plate of bone. 2. a scale, such as any of the scales from the cornified layer of the *epidermis.

squamo- combining form denoting 1. the squamous portion of the temporal bone. 2. squamous epithelium.

squamous bone see temporal bone.

squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) any cancer of squamous epithelium, arising from such tissues as the skin and the lining of the upper airways and digestive tract (especially in the head and neck). SCC is the second commonest form of skin cancer (after *basal cell carcinoma), occurring usually in late-middle and old age. Cumulative sun exposure is the commonest cause but other environmental carcinogens may be responsible. Renal transplant patients are at particularly high risk of this tumour. SCC is mainly found on areas exposed to light and is three times more common in men than in women. SCC grows faster than basal cell carcinoma; it spreads locally at first but later may spread to sites distant from its origin (see metastasis). Treatment is usually by surgical excision or radiotherapy.

squamous epithelium see epithelium.

squint n. see strabismus.

SRY sex reversal on Y. See Y chromosome.

SSG see split-skin graft.

SSPE see subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) any one of a group of *antidepressant drugs that exert their action by blocking the reabsorption of the neurotransmitter *serotonin by the nerve endings in the brain. Their effect is to prolong the action of serotonin in the brain. As well as depression, SSRIs are used to treat anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias. The group includes *citalopram, escitalopram, *fluoxetine, *fluvoxamine, *paroxetine, and *sertraline. Nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common side-effects.

stadium n. (pl. stadia) a stage in the course of a disease; for example, the stadium invasionis is the period between exposure to infection and the onset of symptoms.

stage vb. (in oncology) to classify a primary tumour by its size and the presence or absence of metastases. In addition to clinical examination, a variety of imaging and surgical techniques may be employed to provide a more accurate assessment. Staging tumours is of importance in prognosis and defining appropriate treatment. See also TNM classification.

staghorn calculus a branched stone forming a cast of the collecting system of the kidney and therefore filling the calyces and pelvis. The stone is usually associated with infected urine, the commonest organism being Proteus vulgaris. The combination of obstruction and infection can cause *pyonephrosis and, if neglected, a *perinephric abscess. Treatment involves a *percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

stagnant loop syndrome see blind loop syndrome.

stain 1. n. a dye used to colour tissues and other specimens for microscopical examination. In an acid stain the colour is carried by an acid radical and the stain is taken up by parts of the specimen having a basic (alkaline) reaction. In a basic stain the colour, carried by a basic radical, is attracted to parts of the specimen having an acidic reaction. Neutral stains have neither acidic nor basic affinities. A contrast stain is used to give colour to parts of a tissue not affected by a previously applied stain. A differential stain allows different elements in a specimen to be distinguished by staining them in different colours. 2. vb. to treat a specimen for microscopical study with a stain.

stammering (stuttering) n. halting articulation with interruptions to the normal flow of speech and repetition of the initial consonants of words or syllables. It usually first appears in childhood and the symptoms are most severe when the stammerer is under any psychological stress. It is not a symptom of organic disease and it will usually respond to the re-education of speech by a trained therapist. —stammerer n.

standard deviation (in statistics) a measure of the dispersion of data about their arithmetic *mean, which is calculated from the square root of the variance of the readings in the series. The arithmetic sum of the amounts by which each observation varies from the mean must be zero, but if these variations are squared before being summated, a positive value is obtained: the mean of this value is the variance. (In practice a more reliable estimate of variance is obtained by dividing the sum of the squared deviations by one less than the total number of observations.) A large standard deviation indicates that data points vary across a wide range of values, whereas a small standard deviation indicates the opposite. See also significance.

standard error of the mean (SEM) the *standard deviation within a sample of observations divided by the square root of the number of observations comprising that sample. The SEM measures the extent to which the means of several different samples taken repeatedly from the same population would vary. It is therefore an indication of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the mean of the population as a whole.

standardized mortality ratio (SMR) the ratio of observed mortality rate to expected mortality rate (calculated using indirect standardization), expressed as an integer where 100 represents agreement between observed and expected rates. See standardized rates.

standardized rates rates used to summarize the *morbidity or *mortality experience of a population. Age-specific rates and population structures from a study population and a reference or *standard population are used to produce a weighted average. Standardized rates can be used to compare the health experience of populations with different structures. Direct standardization requires application of age-specific rates from a study population to a reference population structure (e.g. the European standard population) to produce a (directly) standardized rate. Indirect standardization requires application of age-specific rates from a standard population (e.g. England and Wales) to a study population structure to produce an expected morbidity or mortality rate. Compare crude rate.

standard population a notional population used in standardization (see standardized rates). The European standard population is a population of two million, with a defined age structure. It is younger than the England population, and has similar age structures for males and females.

stapedectomy n. surgical removal of the third ear ossicle (stapes), enabling it to be replaced with a prosthetic bone in the treatment of *otosclerosis. A modification of this procedure involves creating a small hole in the base (footplate) of the stapes using a microdrill or laser, rather than completely removing the stapes. This allows insertion of the prosthesis through the hole and is referred to as stapedotomy. Most surgeons consider this procedure to be safer than stapedectomy.

stapedial reflex reflex contraction of the stapedius muscle in the middle ear, attached to the *stapes bone, in response to loud sounds. This protects the cochlea from noise damage by limiting the amount of sound that is transmitted via the stapes. The reflex can be measured using a *tympanometer.

stapes n. a stirrup-shaped bone in the middle *ear that articulates with the incus and is attached to the membrane of the fenestra ovalis. See ossicle.

staphylectomy n. see uvulectomy.

staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (Ritter’s disease) a potentially serious condition of young infants (and occasionally seen in adults) in which the skin becomes reddened and tender and then peels off, giving the appearance of a scald. The area of skin loss may be quite extensive and is usually centred on the armpits and groin. The underlying cause is an infection by certain bacteria of the genus *Staphylococcus. It is contagious and may occur in clusters. Treatment is by antibiotics (usually intravenous), but careful nursing is essential to prevent skin damage. Admission to hospital is mandatory for small children.

Staphylococcus n. a genus of Gram-positive nonmotile spherical bacteria occurring in grapelike clusters. Some species are saprophytes; others parasites. Many species produce *exotoxins. The species S. aureus is commonly present on skin and mucous membranes; it causes boils and internal abscesses. More serious infections caused by staphylococci include pneumonia, bacteraemia, osteomyelitis, and enterocolitis. See also MRSA. —staphylococcal adj.

staphyloma n. abnormal bulging of the cornea or sclera (white) of the eye. Anterior staphyloma is a bulging scar in the cornea to which a part of the iris is attached. It is usually the site of a healed corneal ulcer that has penetrated right through the cornea; the iris blocks the hole and prevents the further leakage of fluid from the front chamber of the eye. In ciliary staphyloma the sclera bulges over the ciliary body as a result of high pressure inside the eyeball. A bulging of the sclera at the back of the eye (posterior staphyloma) occurs in some severe cases of short-sightedness.

staphylorrhaphy (palatorrhaphy, uraniscorrhaphy) n. surgical suture of a cleft palate.

staple n. (in surgery) a piece of metal used to join up pieces of tissue. Staples can be used as an alternative to *sutures for an *anastomosis or to bring together the skin edges of an incision; stapling machines have been produced for this purpose. See also endostapler.

starch n. the form in which *carbohydrates are stored in many plants and a major constituent of the diet. Starch consists of linked glucose units and occurs in two forms, α-amylose and amylopectin. In α-amylose the units are in the form of a long unbranched chain; in amylopectin they form a branched chain. The presence of starch can be detected using iodine: α-amylose gives a blue colour with iodine; amylopectin a red colour. Starch is digested by means of the enzyme *amylase. See also dextrin.

Starling’s law a law stating that, within certain limits, a muscle (including the heart muscle) responds to increased stretching at rest by an increased force of contraction when stimulated. [E. H. Starling (1866–1927), British physiologist]

startle reflex see Moro reflex.

starvation n. see malnutrition.

stasis n. stagnation or cessation of flow; for example, of blood or lymph whose flow is obstructed or of the intestinal contents when onward movement (peristalsis) is hindered.

-stasis combining form denoting stoppage of a flow of liquid; stagnation. Example: haemostasis (of blood).

statementing n. the provision by a local authority of a statement of *special educational needs for children attending school who have mental or physical disabilities severe enough to require extra help at school.

statement of fitness for work a medical certificate that replaced forms Med 3 and Med 5 in April 2010 (see Appendix 8).

static reflex the reflex maintenance of muscular tone for posture.

statin n. any one of a class of drugs that inhibit the action of an enzyme involved in the liver’s production of cholesterol (see HMG CoA reductase). Statins can lower the levels of *low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) by 25–45% and are used mainly to treat hypercholesterolaemia but also to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in susceptible patients. Muscle inflammation and breakdown (see rhabdomyolysis) is a rare but serious side-effect of statins. The class includes *atorvastatin, fluvastatin, *pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and *simvastatin.

status asthmaticus a severe attack of asthma, which often follows a period of poorly controlled asthma. Patients are distressed and very breathless and may die from respiratory failure if not vigorously treated with inhaled oxygen, nebulized or intravenous bronchodilators, and corticosteroid therapy; sedatives are absolutely contraindicated. These patients need hospital care in an intensive care unit.

status epilepticus the occurrence of repeated epileptic seizures without any recovery of consciousness between them. Its control is a medical emergency, since prolonged status epilepticus may lead to the patient’s death or long-term disability.

status lymphaticus enlargement of the thymus gland and other parts of the lymphatic system, formerly believed to be a predisposing cause to sudden death in infancy and childhood associated with hypersensitivity to drugs or vaccines.

Statutory Sick Pay benefit payable to employees who are unable to work because of illness.

STD see sexually transmitted disease.

steapsin n. see lipase.

stearic acid see fatty acid.

steat- (steato-) combining form denoting fat; fatty tissue.

steatoma n. any cyst or tumour of a sebaceous gland.

steatopygia n. the accumulation of large quantities of fat in the buttocks.

steatorrhoea n. the passage of excess fat in the faeces (more than 5 g/day) due to reduced absorption of fat by the intestine (see malabsorption). The faeces are pale, malodorous, may look greasy, and are difficult to flush away.

steatosis n. infiltration of *hepatocytes with fat. This may occur in alcoholism, obesity, metabolic syndrome, pregnancy, malnutrition, viral hepatitis, or certain drugs (such as oestrogens or steroids).

Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome see progressive supranuclear palsy. [J. C. Steele and J. C. Richardson (20th century), Canadian neurologists; J. Olszewski (1913–64), Polish-born Canadian neuropathologist]

Stein–Leventhal syndrome see polycystic ovary syndrome. [I. F. Stein and M. L. Leventhal (20th century), U.S. gynaecologists]

stellate fracture a star-shaped fracture of the kneecap caused by a direct blow. The bone may be either split or severely shattered; if the fragments are displaced, the bone may need to be surgically repaired or rarely removed (patellectomy).

stellate ganglion a star-shaped collection of sympathetic nerve cell bodies in the root of the neck, from which sympathetic nerve fibres are distributed to the face and neck and to the blood vessels and organs of the thorax.

Stellwag’s sign apparent widening of the distance between the upper and lower eyelids (the palpebral fissure) due to retraction of the upper lid and protrusion of the eyeball. It is a sign of exophthalmic *goitre. [C. Stellwag von Carion (1823–1904), Austrian ophthalmologist]

stem cell an undifferentiated cell that is able to renew itself and produce specialized cells. Embryonic stem cells at the *blastocyst stage of development can differentiate into almost any cell type (except placental cells); they are described as pluripotent. Embryonic cells preceding the blastocyst, produced by the first 3–4 divisions of the fertilized egg, are capable of producing all the different cell types required by the developing embryo (i.e. they are totipotent). Adult stem cells (also known as somatic stem cells) occur in many tissues and organs, including bone marrow (see haemopoietic stem cell), muscle, liver, pancreas, etc., and can produce the specialized cells needed in the particular tissue or organ in which they arise (i.e. they are multipotent). See also umbilical cord blood banked stem cells.

STEMI S–T elevation *myocardial infarction.

Stemmer’s sign inability to lift and pinch the skin of the base of the second toe, which is characteristic of lymphoedema. [R. Stemmer (1925–2000), French phlebologist]

steno- combining form denoting 1. narrow. Example: stenocephaly (narrowness of the head). 2. constricted.

stenopaeic adj. (in ophthalmology) describing an optical device consisting of an opaque disc punctured with a fine slit or hole (or holes), which is placed in front of the eye in the same position as glasses and enables sharper vision in cases of gross long- or short-sightedness or astigmatism. It sharpens the image formed on the retina because it confines the light reaching the eye to one or more fine beams, which pass through the centre of the lens undeviated by refractive error.

stenosis n. the abnormal narrowing of a passage or opening, such as a blood vessel or heart valve. See aortic stenosis; carotid artery stenosis; mitral stenosis; pulmonary stenosis; pyloric stenosis.

stenostomia (stenostomy) n. the abnormal narrowing of an opening, such as the opening of the bile duct.

Stensen’s duct the long secretory duct of the *parotid salivary gland. [N. Stensen (1838–86), Danish physician]

stent n. a tube placed inside a tubular structure in the body to keep it open. It may be a simple plastic or metal tube; the former are more easily removable, while the latter give a larger lumen for a given outer diameter. Metallic stents are further divided into self-expanding stents, which open up by themselves on deployment, and balloon-expandable stents, which need to be expanded with the use of a balloon. Stents may be used at operation to aid healing of an anastomosis, for example of a ureter. Alternatively they can be placed across an obstruction to maintain an open lumen, for example in obstruction due to tumour in the oesophagus, stomach, bile ducts, colon, or ureter. In an artery after *angioplasty, stents help to prevent recoiling. The stents used in coronary artery disease are balloon-expandable and nowadays are coated with drugs that inhibit growth of the scar tissue (neointimal hyperplasia) responsible for recurrent stenosis. These are known as drug-eluting stents.

stepping reflex a primitive reflex in newborn babies that should disappear by the age of two months. If the baby is held in a ‘walking’ position with the feet touching the ground, the feet move in a ‘stepping’ manner. Persistence of this reflex beyond two months is suggestive of *cerebral palsy.

sterco- combining form denoting faeces.

stercobilin n. a brownish-red pigment formed during the metabolism of the *bile pigments biliverdin and bilirubin, which are derived from haemoglobin. Stercobilin is subsequently excreted in the urine or faeces.

stercolith n. a solid mass of dried compressed faeces.

stereognosis n. the ability to recognize the three-dimensional shape of an object by touch alone. This is a function of the *association areas of the parietal lobe of the brain. See also agnosia.

stereoisomers pl. n. compounds having the same molecular formula but different three-dimensional arrangements of their atoms. The atomic structures of stereoisomers are mirror images of each other.

stereopsis n. see stereoscopic vision.

stereoscopic vision (stereopsis) perception of the shape, depth, and distance of an object as a result of having *binocular vision. The brain receives two distinct images from the eyes, which it interprets as a single three-dimensional image.

stereotactic localization the accurate localization, with the help of scans, of structures within the body by using three-dimensional measurements. It enables the accurate positioning within the body of radiotherapy beams or sources for the treatment of tumours and of localizing wires for the biopsy of small tumours. See also stereotaxy; cyberknife; gamma knife.

stereotaxy (stereotactic surgery) n. a surgical procedure in which a deep-seated area in the brain is operated upon after its position has been established very accurately by three-dimensional measurements using CT or MRI. The operation may be performed using an electrical current or by heat, cold, or mechanical techniques. See also leucotomy.

stereotypy n. the constant repetition of a complex action, which is carried out in the same way each time. It is seen in *catatonia and *autism; sometimes it is an isolated symptom in people with *learning disability. It is more common in patients who live in institutions where they are bored and unstimulated and can sometimes cause physical injury to the patient.

sterile adj. 1. (of a living organism) barren; unable to reproduce its kind (see sterility). 2. (of inanimate objects) completely free from bacteria, fungi, viruses, or other microorganisms that could cause infection.

sterility n. inability to have children, either due to *infertility or (in someone who has been fertile) deliberately induced by surgical procedures as a means of contraception (see sterilization). Sterility may also be an incidental result of an operation or drug treatment undertaken for other reasons, such as removal of the uterus (*hysterectomy) because of cancer.

sterilization n. 1. a surgical operation or any other process that induces *sterility in men or women. In women, hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of both ovaries) are 100% effective and permanent. Alternatively, the Fallopian tubes may be removed (see salpingectomy) or divided and/or ligated. These operations can be performed through the abdomen or the vagina. The modern technique (tubal occlusion) is to occlude (close) permanently the inner (lower) half of the Fallopian tube through a *laparoscope. The occluding device is usually a clip (the Hulka-Clemens or Filshie clips) or a small plastic ring (Falope ring); *diathermy coagulation carries greater dangers (e.g. bowel burns) and is now little used. A more recent method is the use of a rapid-setting plastic introduced into the tubes through a hysteroscope (see hysteroscopy). Men are usually sterilized by *vasectomy. See also castration. 2. the process by which all types of microorganisms (including spores) are destroyed. This is achieved by the use of heat, radiation, chemicals, or filtration. See also autoclave.

sternomastoid tumour a small painless nonmalignant swelling in the lower half of the *sternomastoid muscle, appearing a few days after birth. It occurs when the neck of the fetus is in an abnormal position in the uterus, which interferes with the blood supply to the affected muscle, and it is most common after breech births. The tumour may cause a slight tilt of the head towards the tumour and turning of the face to the other side. This can be corrected by physiotherapy aimed at increasing all movements of the body, but without stretching the neck.

sternotomy n. surgical division of the breastbone (sternum), performed to allow access to the heart and its major vessels.

sternum n. (pl. sterna) the breastbone: a flat bone, 15–20 cm long, extending from the base of the neck to just below the diaphragm and forming the front part of the skeleton of the thorax. The sternum articulates with the collar bones (see clavicle) and the costal cartilages of the first seven pairs of ribs. It consists of three sections: the middle and longest section – the body or gladiolus – is attached to the *manubrium at the top and the *xiphoid (or ensiform) process at the bottom. The manubrium slopes back from the body so that the junction between the two parts forms an angle (angle of Louis or sternal angle). —sternal adj.

steroid n. one of a group of compounds having a common structure based on the steroid nucleus, which consists of three six-membered carbon rings and one five-membered carbon ring. The naturally occurring steroids include the male and female sex hormones (*androgens and *oestrogens), the hormones of the adrenal cortex (see corticosteroid), *progesterone, *bile salts, and *sterols. Synthetic steroids have been produced for therapeutic purposes.

steroid card a card that must be carried by patients taking long-term corticosteroid medication, particularly if high doses are used. The card states that in an emergency treatment with steroids must not be suddenly stopped since this may precipitate an *Addisonian crisis.

sterol n. one of a group of *steroid alcohols. The most important sterols are *cholesterol and *ergosterol.

stertor n. a snoring type of noisy breathing heard in deeply unconscious patients.

steth- (stetho-) combining form denoting the chest.

stethoscope n. an instrument used for listening to sounds within the body, such as those in the heart and lungs (see auscultation). A simple stethoscope usually consists of a diaphragm or an open bell-shaped structure (which is applied to the body) connected by rubber or plastic tubes to earpieces for the examiner. More complicated devices may contain electronic amplification systems to aid diagnosis.

stevia n. a sugar substitute that is 200 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar. Extracted from Stevia rebaudiana, it is used as a low-calorie sweetener.

sthenia n. a state of normal or greater than normal strength. Compare asthenia. —sthenic adj.

stigma n. (pl. stigmata) 1. a mark that characterizes a particular disease, such as the *café au lait spots characteristic of neurofibromatosis. 2. any spot or lesion on the skin. 3. any condition or disposition that makes a person the subject of moral reproach by society and thus creates a potential barrier to access to health care.

stilet (stylet, stylus) n. 1. a slender probe. 2. a wire placed in the lumen of a catheter to give it rigidity while the instrument is passed along a body canal (such as the urethra).

stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death) n. birth of a fetus that shows no evidence of life (heartbeat, respiration, or independent movement) at any time later than 24 weeks after conception. Under the Stillbirth (Definition) Act 1992, there is a legal obligation to notify all stillbirths to the appropriate authority. The number of such births expressed per 1000 births (live and still) is known as the stillbirth rate. In legal terms, viability is deemed to start at the 24th week of pregnancy and a fetus born dead before this time is known as a *miscarriage or *abortion. However, some fetuses born alive before the 24th week may now survive as a result of improved perinatal care. See also confidential enquiries.

stoma n. (pl. stomata) 1. (in anatomy) the mouth or any mouthlike part. 2. (in surgery) the artificial opening of a hollow organ (e.g. the colon or ileum) that has been brought to the abdominal surface (see colostomy; ileostomy). Stoma therapists are nurses specially trained in the care of these artificial openings and the appliances used with them. —stomal adj.

stomach n. a distensible saclike organ that forms part of the alimentary canal between the oesophagus (gullet) and the duodenum (see illustration overleaf). It communicates with the former by means of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), or cardiac sphincter, and with the latter by the pyloric sphincter. The stomach lies just below the diaphragm, to the right of the spleen and partly under the liver. Its function is to continue the process of digestion that begins in the mouth. *Gastric juice, secreted by gastric glands in the mucosa, contains hydrochloric acid and the enzyme *pepsin, which contribute to chemical digestion. This – together with the churning action of the muscular layers of the stomach – reduces the food to a semiliquid partly digested mass that passes on to the duodenum.

Stomach. Regions of the stomach seen from the front (above); layers of the stomach wall (below).





stomach stapling (gastric stapling, vertical banded gastroplasty) restrictive *bariatric surgery in which staples are inserted into the wall of the stomach to form a small pouch, which restricts the amount of food that can be eaten. At the same time a gastric band is applied to limit the size of the opening between the pouch and the rest of the stomach.

strabismus (heterotropia) n. squint: abnormal alignment of the two eyes. The strabismus is most commonly horizontal – convergent strabismus (or esotropia) or divergent strabismus (exotropia) – but it may be vertical (hypertropia, in which the eye looks upwards, or hypotropia, in which it looks downwards). In rare cases both eyes look towards the same point but one is twisted clockwise or anticlockwise in relation to the other (cyclotropia). Usually strabismus is concomitant, i.e. the abnormal alignment of the two eyes remains fairly constant, in whatever direction the person is looking. Strabismus acquired by injury or disease is usually incomitant, i.e. the degree of misalignment varies in different directions of gaze. See also cover test; deviation; divergence; heterophoria.

strain 1. n. excessive stretching or working of a muscle, resulting in pain and swelling of the muscle. Compare sprain. 2. n. a group of organisms, such as bacteria, obtained from a particular source or having special properties distinguishing them from other members of the same species. 3. vb. to damage a muscle by overstretching.

strain gauge a sensitive instrument for measuring tension and alterations in pressure. It is extensively used in medical instruments.

Streptobacillus n. a genus of Gram-negative aerobic nonmotile rodlike bacteria that tend to form filaments. The single species, S. moniliformis, is a normal inhabitant of the respiratory tract of rats but causes *rat-bite fever in humans.

streptococcal toxic shock syndrome a bacterial disease characterized by fever, shock, and multiple organ failure. It is similar to the *toxic shock syndrome caused by staphylococci, but in these cases the infecting organisms are *Streptococcus Type A bacteria. See also necrotizing fasciitis.

Streptococcus n. a genus of Gram-positive nonmotile spherical bacteria occurring in chains. Most species are saprophytes; some are pathogenic. Many pathogenic species are haemolytic, i.e. they have the ability to destroy red blood cells in blood agar. This provides a useful basis for classifying the many different strains. Strains of S. pyogenes (the β-haemolytic streptococci) are associated with many infections, including *scarlet fever, and produce many *exotoxins. Strains of the α-haemolytic streptococci are associated with bacterial *endocarditis. The species S. pneumoniae (formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae) – the pneumococcus – is associated with serious diseases, including pneumonia, pneumococcal *meningitis, and septicaemia; it is also a common bacterial cause of ear infections (see also pneumococcal vaccine). It occurs in pairs, surrounded by a capsule (see quellung reaction). S. mutans has been shown to cause dental caries. See also Lancefield classification; streptokinase. —streptococcal adj.

streptodornase n. an enzyme produced by some haemolytic bacteria of the genus Streptococcus that is capable of liquefying pus. See also streptokinase.

streptokinase n. an enzyme produced by some haemolytic bacteria of the genus *Streptococcus that is capable of liquefying blood clots (see also fibrinolytic). It is given to treat blockage of blood vessels, including deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism (see thrombolysis). Side-effects may include digestive upsets, haemorrhage, and fever.

streptolysin n. an *exotoxin that is produced by strains of Streptococcus bacteria and destroys red blood cells.

Streptomyces n. a genus of aerobic mouldlike bacteria. Most species live in the soil, but some are parasites of animals, humans, and plants; in humans they cause *Madura foot. They are important medically as a source of such antibiotics as *streptomycin, *neomycin, *dactinomycin, and *chloramphenicol.

streptomycin n. an *aminoglycoside antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces griseus, that is used in combination with other drugs for treating tuberculosis and brucellosis. Side-effects causing ear and kidney damage may develop in some patients.

stress n. any factor that threatens the health of the body or has an adverse effect on its functioning, such as injury, disease, overwork, or worry. The existence of one form of stress tends to diminish resistance to other forms. Constant stress brings about changes in the balance of hormones in the body.

stress fracture a fracture occurring in normal bone that has been subjected to excessive and repetitive trauma resulting in cumulative microscopic fractures. Over time, these microfractures exceed the capacity of the normal healing process, resulting in the development of a macroscopic fracture (also known as a fatigue fracture). Patients are usually long-distance runners, ballet dancers, footballers, and others who undergo regular intensive training. Pain, localized tenderness, and swelling gradually develop; initially, X-rays are normal, but a bone scan or MRI will usually allow diagnosis to be made. Treatment includes protected weight bearing, rest, cross-training, and (less commonly) surgery.

stress incontinence see incontinence.

stress test an investigation to seek evidence of cardiac *ischaemia. The heart is stressed by exercise or by the administration of an intravenous drug that increases heart rate (i.e. mimicked exercise). Ischaemia may then be detected by electrocardiography (stress ECG or exercise ECG), *echocardiography (showing the development of impaired function in areas of heart muscle that are ischaemic), *myocardial perfusion scan, or cardiac MRI.

stress ulcers gastric or duodenal ulcers that can be associated with physiological stress from severe head injury (Cushing’s ulcers) or major burns (Curling’s ulcers).

stretch receptor a cell or group of cells found between muscle fibres that responds to stretching of the muscle by transmitting impulses to the central nervous system through the sensory nerves. Stretch receptors are part of the *proprioceptor system necessary for the performance of coordinated muscular activity.

stretch reflex (myotatic reflex) the reflex contraction of a muscle in response to its being stretched.

stria n. (pl. striae) (in anatomy) a streak, line, or thin band. The striae gravidarum (stretch marks) are the lines that appear on the skin of the abdomen of pregnant women, due to excessive stretching of the elastic fibres. Red or purple during pregnancy, they become white after delivery. The stria terminalis is a white band that separates the thalamus from the ventricular surface of the caudate nucleus in the brain.

striated muscle a tissue comprising the bulk of the body’s musculature. It is also known as skeletal muscle, because it is attached to the skeleton and is responsible for the movement of bones, and voluntary muscle, because it is under voluntary control. Striated muscle is composed of parallel bundles of multinucleate fibres (each containing many myofibrils), which reveal cross-banding when viewed under the microscope. This effect is caused by the alternation of actin and myosin protein filaments within each myofibril (see illustration). According to the ‘sliding filament’ theory, when muscle contraction takes place, the two sets of filaments slide past each other, so reducing the length of each unit (sarcomere) of the myofibril. The sliding is caused by a series of cyclic reactions, requiring ATP, resulting in a change in orientation of projections on the myosin filaments; each projection is first attached to an actin filament but contracts and releases it to become reattached at a different site.

Structure of striated muscle.





stricture n. a narrowing of any tubular structure in the body, such as the oesophagus (gullet), biliary tract, bowel, ureter, or urethra. A stricture may result from inflammation, muscular spasm, growth of a tumour within the affected part, or from pressure on it by neighbouring organs. For example, a urethral stricture is a fibrous narrowing of the urethra, usually resulting from injury or inflammation. The patient has increasing difficulty in passing urine and may develop urinary *retention. The site and length of the stricture is assessed by *urethrography and urethroscopy, and treatment is by periodic dilatation of the urethra using *sounds, *urethrotomy, or *urethroplasty. Strictures in the gastrointestinal tract may be dilated by *balloons or treated surgically by *stricturoplasty or division stricturotomy. Symptomatic malignant strictures can be managed by insertion of a *stent to relieve the obstruction, especially in cases of oesophageal, colonic, or biliary strictures.

stricturoplasty n. an operation in which a stricture (usually in the small intestine) is widened by cutting it longitudinally and suturing transversely.

stridor n. the noise heard on breathing in when the trachea or larynx is obstructed. It tends to be louder and harsher than *wheeze.

strobila n. (pl. strobilae) the entire chain of segments that make up the body of an adult *tapeworm.

stroke (apoplexy) n. a sudden attack of weakness usually affecting one side of the body. It is the consequence of an interruption to the flow of blood to the brain. An ischaemic stroke occurs when the flow of blood is prevented by clotting (see thrombosis) or by a detached clot, either from the heart or a large vessel (such as the carotid artery), that lodges in an artery (see embolism). A haemorrhagic stroke results from rupture of an artery wall (see cerebral haemorrhage). Prolonged reduction of blood pressure may result in more diffuse brain damage, as after a cardiorespiratory arrest. A stroke can vary in severity from a passing weakness or tingling in a limb (see transient ischaemic attack) to a profound paralysis, coma, and death.

stroke volume the amount of blood ejected from each ventricle on each contraction, which can be affected by medication, exercise, decreases in the volume of circulating blood, or heart anomalies. In a healthy adult, stroke volume is estimated at 70 ml.

stroma n. the connective tissue basis of an organ, as opposed to the functional tissue (parenchyma). For example, the stroma of the erythrocytes is the spongy framework of protein strands within a red blood cell in which the blood pigment haemoglobin is packed; the stroma of the cornea is the transparent fibrous tissue making up the main body of the cornea.

Strongyloides n. a genus of small slender nematode worms that live as parasites inside the small intestines of mammals. S. stercoralis infects the human small intestine (see strongyloidiasis); its larvae, which are passed out in the stools, develop quickly into infective forms.

strongyloidiasis (strongyloidosis) n. an infestation of the small intestine with the parasitic nematode worm Strongyloides stercoralis, common in humid tropical regions. Larvae, present in soil contaminated with human faeces, penetrate the skin of a human host and may produce an itching rash. They migrate to the lungs, where they cause tissue destruction and bleeding, and then via the windpipe and gullet to the intestine. Adult worms burrow into the intestinal wall and may cause ulceration, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, anaemia, and weakness. Treatment involves use of ivermectin or albendazole.

strontium n. a yellow metallic element, absorption of which causes bone damage when its atoms displace calcium in bone. The radioactive isotope strontium-90, which emits beta rays, is used in radiotherapy for the *contact therapy of skin and eye tumours and in *radioimmunotherapy in combination with *monoclonal antibodies. Another isotope, strontium-89 (Metastron), has an established role in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma: it is given by intravenous injection for the relief of pain due to bone metastases. Symbol: Sr.

struma n. (pl. strumae) a swelling of the thyroid gland (see goitre). See also Riedel’s struma.

struma ovarii a *teratoma of the ovary containing thyroid tissue that becomes overactive and causes thyrotoxicosis. It is diagnosed by radioiodine scanning showing a high uptake in the pelvis; the treatment is surgical removal of the affected ovary.

strychnine n. a poisonous alkaloid produced in the seeds of the East Indian tree Strychnos nux-vomica. In small doses it was formerly widely used in ‘tonics’. Poisoning causes painful muscular spasms similar to those of tetanus; the back becomes arched (the posture known as opisthotonos) and death is likely to occur from spasm in the respiratory muscles.

S–T segment the segment on an *electrocardiogram that represents the interval between the end of ventricular *depolarization (QRS complex) and the beginning of ventricular *repolarization (T wave). The S–T segment is usually depressed by *ischaemia of the heart muscle but raised in the initial phase of myocardial infarction. It is therefore very useful for diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain.

Identification of the site of the aneurysm, upon which decisions about treatment will be based, is achieved by cerebral *angiography.

subarachnoid space the space between the arachnoid and pia *meninges of the brain and spinal cord, containing circulating cerebrospinal fluid and large blood vessels. Several large spaces within it are known as cisternae.

subclavian artery either of two arteries supplying blood to the neck and arms. The right subclavian artery branches from the innominate artery; the left subclavian arises directly from the aortic arch.

subclavian steal syndrome a syndrome produced by proximal narrowing of the subclavian artery. There are no symptoms at rest, but when the affected arm is exercised blood is diverted to the arm down the main subclavian artery, away from smaller branches that arise just beyond the narrowing (i.e. ‘stolen’ from these branches). If branches to the brain are affected, *syncope may result. The syndrome may result in chest pain in people in whom an internal mammary artery branch of the subclavian artery has been used to bypass a coronary narrowing (see coronary artery bypass graft).

substituted judgment a decision made by someone on behalf of a patient lacking capacity that is judged to reflect what the patient would have wanted had he or she had the mental capacity to decide for him- or herself. This judgment is best made by someone close to the patient who has a good knowledge of the patient’s beliefs, opinions, and character, provided that there are no potentially conflicting and partial interests at play. See also power of attorney; proxy decision.

substitution n. 1. (in psychoanalysis) the replacement of one idea by another: a form of *defence mechanism. 2. (symptom substitution) (in psychology) the supposed process whereby removing one psychological symptom leads to another symptom appearing if the basic psychological cause has not been removed. It is controversial whether this happens. 3. the replacement of one addictive and dangerous drug with another that is better controlled and easier to manage, with the aim of harm reduction.

substitution therapy provision of a less harmful alternative to a drug or remedy that a patient has been receiving. It is used when the patient has become addicted to a drug or is placing too much reliance upon a particular remedy.

sucrose n. a carbohydrate consisting of glucose and fructose. Sucrose is the principal constituent of cane sugar and sugar beet; it is the sweetest of the natural dietary carbohydrates. The increasing consumption of sucrose in the last 50 years has coincided with an increase in the incidence of dental caries, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and obesity.

suction n. the use of reduced pressure to remove unwanted fluids or other material through a tube for disposal. Suction is often used to clear secretions from the airways of newly born infants to aid breathing. During surgery, suction tubes are used to remove blood from the area of operation and to decompress the stomach (nasogastric suction) and the pleural space of air and blood (chest suction).

Sudan stains a group of azo compounds used for staining fats. The group includes Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III, Sudan IV, and Sudan black.

sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, cot death) the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than two years old (peak occurrence between two and six months) from an unidentifiable cause. There appear to be many factors involved, the most important of which is the position in which the baby is laid to sleep: babies who sleep on their fronts (the prone position) have an increased risk. Other factors increasing the risk include parental smoking, overheating with bedding, prematurity, and a history of SIDS within the family. About half the affected infants will have had a viral upper respiratory tract infection within the 48 hours preceding their death, many of these being due to the *respiratory syncytial virus.

suicide n. deliberately causing one’s own death. A distinction is usually drawn between attempted suicide, when death is averted although the person concerned intended to kill himself (or herself), and other forms of *deliberate self-harm, when the harm is inflicted for reasons other than actually killing oneself. Following the Suicide Act 1961, suicide is not a criminal offence in the UK, but it remains a criminal offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the suicide of another (see assisted suicide). There is good evidence that asking about suicidal thoughts and especially plans is important in the management of depression: and no mention or attempt should be dismissed without appropriate assessment and help, especially in vulnerable groups, such as teenagers or the isolated elderly. Charities such as Samaritans have a vital role to play. See also autonomy.

sulpha drug see sulphonamide.

sulphonamide (sulpha drug) n. one of a group of drugs, derived from sulphanilamide (a red dye), that prevent the growth of bacteria (i.e. they are bacteriostatic). Sulphonamides are effective against a variety of infections and were formerly widely used; because many of them are rapidly excreted and very soluble in the urine, they were particularly useful in treating infections of the urinary tract.

A variety of side-effects may occur with sulphonamide treatment, including nausea, vomiting, headache, and loss of appetite; more severe effects include *cyanosis, blood disorders, skin rashes, and fever. Because of increasing bacterial resistance to sulphonamides, and with the development of more effective less toxic antibiotics, the clinical use of these drugs has declined. Those still used include *sulfadiazine, *sulfasalazine, and sulfamethoxazole (combined with trimethoprim in *co-trimoxazole).

sulphone n. one of a group of drugs closely related to the *sulphonamides in structure and therapeutic actions. Sulphones possess powerful activity against the bacteria that cause leprosy and tuberculosis. The best known sulphone is *dapsone.

sunburn n. damage to the skin by excessive exposure to the sun’s rays, principally UVB (ultraviolet B), at wavelengths of 290–320 nm. Sunburn may vary from reddening of the skin to the development of large painful fluid-filled blisters, which may cause shock if they cover a large area (see burn). Fair-skinned red-haired people (Fitzpatrick skin phototype I) are more susceptible to sunburn than others. Severe sunburn in childhood is a risk factor for the development of malignant *melanoma and other skin tumours in later life.

sunitinib n. an inhibitor of multiple kinases (see protein kinase; tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that blocks the action of *vascular endothelial growth factor.

superinfection n. an infection arising during the course of another infection and caused by a different microorganism, which is usually resistant to the drugs used to treat the primary infection. The infective agent may be a normally harmless inhabitant of the body that becomes pathogenic when other harmless types are removed by the drugs or it may be a resistant variety of the primary infective agent, such as *MRSA (see also meticillin).

superior adj. (in anatomy) situated uppermost in the body in relation to another structure or surface.

superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) a rare condition characterized by sound- or pressure-induced vertigo (see Tullio phenomenon), hearing loss, *autophony, and a sense of fullness in the affected ear.

swallowing (deglutition) n. the process by which food is transferred from the mouth to the oesophagus (gullet). Voluntary raising of the tongue forces food backwards towards the pharynx. This stimulates reflex actions in which the larynx is closed by the epiglottis and the nasal passages are closed by the soft palate, so that food does not enter the trachea (windpipe). Lastly, food moves down the oesophagus by *peristalsis and gravity.

Swan–Ganz catheter a catheter with an inflatable balloon at its tip, which can be inserted into the pulmonary artery via the right chambers of the heart. Inflation of the balloon enables indirect measurement of pressure in the left atrium. [H. J. C. Swan (1922–2005), US cardiologist; W. Ganz (20th century), US engineer]

sweat n. the watery fluid secreted by the *sweat glands. Its principal constituents in solution are sodium chloride and urea. The secretion of sweat is a means of excreting nitrogenous waste; at the same time it has a role in controlling the temperature of the body – the evaporation of sweat from the surface of the skin has a cooling effect. Therefore an increase in body temperature causes an increase in sweating. Other factors that increase the secretion of sweat include pain, nausea, nervousness, and drugs (*diaphoretics). Sweating is reduced by colds, diarrhoea, and certain drugs. Anatomical name: sudor.

sweat gland a simple coiled tubular *exocrine gland that lies in the dermis of the *skin. A long duct carries its secretion (*sweat) to the surface of the skin. Sweat glands occur over most of the surface of the body; they are particularly abundant in the armpits, on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, and on the forehead.

swine influenza a disease of domesticated pigs, first seen in humans in early 2009, caused by H1N1, a strain of *influenza A virus. Very contagious, the World Health Organization has now declared it to be a pandemic strain in humans. Swine influenza is currently believed not to be as virulent as *avian influenza and it seems to be less severe than the virulent 1918 pandemic, with which it shares antigenic features.

sycosis n. inflammation of the hair follicles caused by infection with Staphylococcus aureus; it commonly affects the beard area (sycosis barbae) of men in their thirties or forties. The infection usually spreads unless treated by applying antibiotic ointments or giving antibiotics by mouth.

Sydenham’s chorea a form of *chorea that mainly affects children and adolescents, especially females. It can occur some months after an infection caused by β-haemolytic streptococci (such as rheumatic fever or scarlet fever), causing uncontrolled movements of the muscles of the shoulders, hips, and face (hence the archaic name, St Vitus’ dance). Formerly a frightening disease, it is now readily cured by antibiotics. [G. Sydenham (1624–89), English physician]

symbolism n. (in psychology) the process of representing an object or an idea by something else. Typically an abstract idea is represented by a simpler and more tangible image. Psychoanalytic theorists hold that conscious ideas frequently act as symbols for unconscious thoughts and that this is particularly evident in dreaming, in *free association, and in the formation of psychological symptoms. According to this theory, a symptom might be a symbolic representation of an unconscious idea. —symbolic adj.

symmelia n. see sirenomelia.

symmetry n. (in anatomy) correspondence of form on either side of a plane or axis. Human bodies are symmetrical around the *sagittal plane.

sympathectomy n. the surgical *division of sympathetic nerve fibres. It is done to minimize the effects of normal or excessive sympathetic activity. Most often it is used to improve the circulation to part of the body; less commonly to inhibit excess sweating or to relieve the *photophobia induced by an abnormally dilated pupil of the eye.

sympathetic nervous system one of the two divisions of the *autonomic nervous system, having fibres that leave the central nervous system, via a chain of ganglia close to the spinal cord, in the thoracic and lumbar regions. Its nerves are distributed to the blood vessels, heart, lungs, intestines and other abdominal organs, sweat glands, salivary glands, and the genitals, whose functions it governs by reflex action, in balance with the *parasympathetic nervous system.

sympathin n. the name given by early physiologists to the substances released from sympathetic nerve endings, now known to be a mixture of *adrenaline and *noradrenaline.

sympathoblast n. one of the small cells formed in the early development of nerve tissue that eventually become the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system.

sympatholytic adj. opposing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. *Guanethidine blocks the transmission of impulses along adrenergic nerves; it is used to treat high blood pressure. *Alpha blockers and *beta blockers are other kinds of sympatholytic drugs.

sympathomimetic adj. having the effect of stimulating the *sympathetic nervous system. The actions of sympathomimetic drugs are adrenergic: they act on alpha or beta *adrenoceptors. Alpha-adrenergic stimulants (alpha agonists) stimulate alpha receptors. They include *vasoconstrictors (e.g. *ephedrine, *phenylephrine, *metaraminol), used to treat nasal congestion and severe hypotension, and the selective α2 agonists *apraclonidine and *brimonidine, which are used in the treatment of glaucoma. Beta-adrenergic stimulants (beta agonists) stimulate β1 and/or β2 adrenoceptors. β2 agonists such as *salbutamol, *salmeterol, and *terbutaline relax bronchial smooth muscle and are used as *bronchodilators. Some β2 agonists, including salbutamol, relax uterine muscle and are sometimes used in the treatment of premature labour (see tocolytic). β1 agonists (e.g. *dobutamine) stimulate β1 receptors in the heart and are therefore used for their *inotropic effects.

sympathy n. (in physiology) a reciprocal influence exercised by different parts of the body on one another.

symphysiotomy n. the operation of cutting through the front of the pelvis at the pubic *symphysis in order to enlarge the diameter of the pelvis and aid delivery of a fetus whose head is too large to pass through the pelvic opening. This procedure is now rarely employed.

symphysis n. 1. a joint in which the bones are separated by fibrocartilage, which minimizes movement and makes the bony structure rigid. Examples are the pubic symphysis (the joint between the pubic bones of the pelvis) and the joints of the backbone, which are separated by intervertebral discs (see illustration). 2. the line that marks the fusion of two bones that were separate at an early stage of development, such as the symphysis of the *mandible. —symphysial or symphyseal adj.

Symphysis between two vertebrae.

symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) pain in the region of the pelvic girdle, most commonly over the pubic bone in the front or in the lower back and usually caused by excessive movement of the symphysis pubis and other pelvic joints. This is common during pregnancy, hence the condition is also called pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP). Treatment is usually with physiotherapy.

sympodia n. see sirenomelia.

symptom n. an indication of a disease or disorder noticed by the patient himself. A presenting symptom is one that leads a patient to consult a doctor. Compare sign.

Serum cortisol is measured before and then 30 minutes (or 5 hours) after an intramuscular injection of 250 μg (or 1 mg) tetracosactide (Synacthen), an analogue of *ACTH. The adrenal glands are considered to be inadequate if there is a low baseline concentration of cortisol or the rise is less than a certain predefined amount.

synaesthesia n. a condition in which a secondary subjective sensation (often colour) is experienced at the same time as the sensory response normally evoked by the stimulus. For example, the sound of the word ‘cat’ might evoke the colour purple.

synalgia n. see referred pain.

synapse n. the minute gap across which *nerve impulses pass from one neuron to the next, at the end of a nerve fibre. Reaching a synapse, an impulse causes the release of a *neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the gap and triggers an electrical impulse in the next neuron. Some brain cells have more than 15,000 synapses. See also neuromuscular junction.

It usually occurs at the back of the thumb (de Quervain’s tendovaginitis) and results in pain on using the wrists. Treatment is by rest, injection of cortisone into the tendon sheath, and, if these fail, surgical incision of the sheath.

tenecteplase n. see fibrinolytic; tissue-type plasminogen activator.

tenesmus n. a sensation of the desire to defecate or urinate, associated with straining and the passage of minimal volumes of faeces or urine or none at all. Rectal tenesmus may be due to *proctitis, prolapse of the rectum, rectal tumour, or *irritable bowel syndrome.

tennis elbow a painful condition causing degeneration of the origin of the common extensor tendon on the lateral epicondyle of the *humerus, due to overuse of the forearm muscles. Treatment is by rest, massage, and local corticosteroid injection. If the symptoms do not settle, surgery may be required. See also tendinitis. Compare golfer’s elbow.

Tenon’s capsule the fibrous tissue that lines the orbit and surrounds the eyeball. [J. R. Tenon (1724–1816), French surgeon]

tenoplasty n. surgical repair of a ruptured or severed tendon.

tenorrhaphy n. the surgical operation of uniting the ends of divided tendons by suture.

tenosynovitis (peritendinitis) n. inflammation of a tendon sheath, producing pain, swelling, and an audible creaking on movement. It may result from a bacterial infection or occur as part of a rheumatic disease causing *synovitis.

tenotomy n. surgical *division of a tendon. This may be necessary to correct a joint deformity caused by tendon shortening or to reduce the imbalance of forces caused by an overactive muscle in a spastic limb. Tenotomy of the tensor tympani muscle is sometimes used in the treatment of *middle ear myoclonus. See also scissor leg.

tenovaginitis n. see tendovaginitis.

TENS see transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

tension-free vaginal tape (transvaginal tape, TVT) a surgical sling procedure for treating stress incontinence in women that uses a tape made of polypropylene mesh. The tape is inserted under the mid-urethra (rather than the bladder neck, as in a *pubovaginal sling), passing through the retropubic space on either side, and is fixed to the abdominal wall just internal to the pubic symphysis. The transobturator tape (TOT) procedure is similar, but in this technique a tunnel is created out to the *obturator foramen on either side, lessening the risk of vascular and bladder injuries. Tape procedures have lower morbidity rates than *colposuspension and have gradually replaced the latter as the surgical procedure of choice for treating female stress incontinence, but there may be complications associated with nonabsorbable mesh.

tensor n. any muscle that causes stretching or tensing of a part of the body.

tensor tympani see tonic tensor tympani syndrome.

tent n. 1. an enclosure of material (usually transparent plastic) around a patient in bed, into which a gas or vapour can be passed as part of treatment. An oxygen tent is relatively inefficient as a means of administering oxygen; a face mask or intranasal oxygen are used where possible. 2. a piece of dried vegetable material, usually a seaweed stem, shaped to fit into an orifice, such as the cervical canal. As it absorbs moisture it expands, providing a slow but forceful means of dilating the orifice.

tented diaphragm the radiological sign of a raised diaphragm, which is observed in many conditions including *subphrenic abscess, previous abdominal surgery, *peritonitis, damage to the nerve innervating the diaphragm (the phrenic nerve), and various lung-related disease processes.

teratoma n. a tumour composed of a number of tissues that are not usually found at that site and are derived from all three embryonic *germ layers. Teratomas most frequently occur in the testis and ovary (see dermoid cyst), possibly derived from remnants of embryonic cells that have the ability to differentiate into many types of tissue; in most malignant teratomas, cells from all three *germ layers are present. Malignant teratoma of the testis is found in young men: it is more common in patients with a history of undescended testis. Like *seminoma, it frequently occurs as a painless swelling of one testis (pain is not a good indication that the swelling is benign). Treatment is by *orchidectomy avoiding an incision into the scrotum. The tumour can spread to lymph nodes, lungs, and bone, treatment of which may involve the use of chemotherapy drugs, such as vinblastine, bleomycin, cisplatin, and etoposide, with a high cure rate even in metastatic disease.

Teratomas often produce *alpha-fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, or both; the presence of these substances (*tumour markers) in the blood is a useful indication of the amount of tumour and the effect of treatment.

teratospermia n. see oligospermia.

terbinafine n. an antifungal drug used to treat infections of the nails and ringworm. Possible side-effects with oral treatment include nausea, abdominal pain, and allergic skin rashes.

testicular feminization syndrome see androgen insensitivity syndrome.

testis n. (pl. testes) either of the pair of male sex organs that produce spermatozoa and secrete the male sex hormone *androgen under the control of *gonadotrophins from the pituitary gland. The testes of the fetus form within the abdomen but descend into the *scrotum in order to maintain a lower temperature that favours the production and storage of spermatozoa. The bulk of the testis is made up of long convoluted seminiferous tubules (see illustration), in which the spermatozoa develop (see spermatogenesis). The tubules also contain *Sertoli cells, which may nourish developing sperm cells. Spermatozoa pass from the testis to the *epididymis to complete their development. The interstitial (Leydig) cells, between the tubules, are the major producers of androgens.

Testis (longitudinal section).





test meal a standard meal given to stimulate secretion of digestive juices, which can then be withdrawn by tube and measured as a test of digestive function. A fractional test meal was a gruel preparation to stimulate gastric secretion, whose acid content was measured. This has been replaced by tests using secretory stimulants. The Lundh test meal is a meal of oil and protein to stimulate pancreatic secretion, which is withdrawn from the duodenum and its trypsin content measured as a test of pancreatic function.

testosterone n. the principal male sex hormone (see androgen). Formed from androstenedione within the interstitial cells of the *testis, it is converted in target cells to *dihydrotestosterone, which mediates most of its actions. Preparations of testosterone are used for replacement therapy in males with testosterone deficiency; they can be administered orally, by intramuscular depot injection, or topically (in the form of skin patches or gels).

tetanus (lockjaw) n. an acute infectious disease, affecting the nervous system, caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Infection occurs by contamination of wounds by bacterial spores. Bacteria multiply at the site of infection and produce a toxin that irritates nerves so that they cause spasmodic contraction of muscles. Symptoms appear 4–25 days after infection and consist of muscle stiffness, spasm, and subsequent rigidity, first in the jaw and neck then in the back, chest, abdomen, and limbs; in severe cases the spasm may affect the whole body, which is arched backwards (see opisthotonos). High fever, convulsions, and extreme pain are common. If respiratory muscles are affected, a *tracheostomy or intubation and ventilation is essential to avoid death from asphyxia. Mortality is high in untreated cases but prompt treatment is effective. An attack does not necessarily confer complete immunity. Immunization against tetanus is effective but temporary. —tetanic adj.

tetany n. spasm and twitching of the muscles, particularly those of the face, hands, and feet. Tetany is usually caused by a reduction in the blood calcium level, which may be due to underactive parathyroid glands, rickets, or *alkalosis.

They are usually given to treat various conditions, including infections caused by *Chlamydia species, respiratory-tract infections, and acne. Side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are fairly common. In addition, suppression of normal intestinal bacteria may make the patient susceptible to infection with tetracycline-resistant organisms. Tetracyclines should not be administered after the fourth month of pregnancy and their use should be avoided in children under 12 to prevent unsightly staining of the permanent teeth.

It has been used to control psychiatric symptoms of severe anxiety and distress, in which cases the lesion is made in the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, which connects with the frontal lobe. It is now extremely rarely used. See also psychosurgery.

thalamus n. (pl. thalami) one of two egg-shaped masses of grey matter that lie deep in the cerebral hemispheres in each side of the forebrain. The thalami are relay stations for all the sensory messages that enter the brain, before they are transmitted to the cortex. All sensory pathways, except that for the sense of smell, are linked to nuclei within the thalamus, and it is here that the conscious awareness of messages as sensations – temperature, pain, touch, etc. – probably begins.

thalassaemia (Cooley’s anaemia) n. a hereditary blood disease, widespread in the Mediterranean countries, Asia, and Africa, in which there is an abnormality in the protein part of the *haemoglobin molecule. The affected red cells cannot function normally, leading to anaemia. Other symptoms include enlargement of the spleen and abnormalities of the bone marrow. Individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are severely affected (thalassaemia major), but those inheriting it from only one parent are usually symptom-free. Patients with the major disease are treated with repeated blood transfusions or bone marrow transplantation. The disease can be detected by prenatal diagnosis.

thalidomide n. a drug that was formerly used as a sedative. If taken during the first three months of pregnancy, it was found to cause fetal abnormalities involving limb malformation and was withdrawn as a sedative in 1962. Recently, however, thalidomide has been found to be effective in treating myeloma and severe reactions in leprosy. It appears to act in various ways, including as an immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory agent, and angiogenesis inhibitor. Side-effects include constipation, drowsiness, and (with long-term use) peripheral neuropathy. It should not be used in women who are pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant.

thallium-technetium isotope subtraction imaging a technique to image the parathyroid glands. Technetium is taken up only by the thyroid gland, but thallium is taken up by both the thyroid and parathyroid glands. *Digital subtraction of the two isotopes leaves an image of the parathyroid glands alone. It is an accurate technique (90%) for the identification of adenomas of the parathyroid glands secreting excess hormone.

theca n. a sheathlike surrounding tissue. For example, the theca folliculi is the outer wall of a *Graafian follicle.

theine n. the active volatile principle found in tea (see caffeine).

therapeutic misconception a common misunderstanding on the part of patients involved in a research trial that they themselves will benefit from its findings. Researchers and recruiters for research have an ethical duty to check for this misunderstanding and to correct it wherever possible. If they do not, the principle of *informed consent may be breached.

therapeutic privilege the entitlement of a doctor to withhold information from a patient when it is feared that disclosure could cause immediate and serious harm to the patient (e.g. because he or she is suffering from severe depression). In exceptional cases, the need to withhold information may be considered to override the requirement to obtain informed *consent before proceeding with treatment. In such a case therapeutic privilege could be used as a legal defence against the charge of *battery or *negligence. If doctors are intending to invoke the concept of therapeutic privilege they must be prepared to justify their decision. Furthermore, while it was once quite common for doctors to withhold bad news or upsetting information from patients for *paternalistic motives, it is now considered a breach of the patient’s *autonomy and the ethicolegal justification for invoking therapeutic privilege where a patient has *capacity is, if it exists at all, extremely limited.

therapeutics n. the branch of medicine that deals with different methods of treatment and healing (therapy), particularly the use of drugs in the cure of disease.

thermocoagulation n. the coagulation and destruction of tissues by cautery.

thermography n. a technique for measuring and recording the heat produced by different parts of the body by using photographic film sensitive to infrared radiation. The picture produced is called a thermogram. The heat radiated from the body varies in different parts according to the flow of blood through the vessels; thus areas of poor circulation produce less heat. On the other hand a tumour with an abnormally increased blood supply may be revealed on the thermogram as a ‘hot spot’. The technique was formerly used in the diagnosis of tumours of the breast (mammothermography) before the development of more sensitive techniques (see mammography).

thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) a radiation *dosimeter that utilizes the ability of activated sodium fluoride to luminesce in proportion to the radiation dose to which it is exposed when it is heated. It is now a common form of radiation dosimeter for personnel monitoring.

thermolysis n. (in physiology) the dissipation of body heat by such processes as the evaporation of sweat from the skin surface.

thermometer n. a device for registering temperature. A clinical thermometer consists of a sealed narrow-bore glass tube with a bulb at one end. It contains mercury, which expands when heated and rises up the tube. The tube is calibrated in degrees, and is designed to register temperatures between 35°C (95°F) and 43.5°C (110°F). An oral thermometer is placed in the mouth; a rectal thermometer is inserted into the rectum.

Thiazolidinediones should not be used in patients with heart failure or bladder cancer or with a history of these.

Thiersch’s graft see split-skin graft. [K. Thiersch (1822–95), German surgeon]

thin membrane disease an inherited disease of the kidneys in which the glomerular basement membrane, which filters waste material from the blood, is too thin, allowing small amounts of blood to pass across it. This can be a cause of benign familial haematuria and thin membrane disease is a common finding in renal biopsy series where the procedure has been carried out as part of the investigation of *haematuria. Thin membranes are also found in other conditions, e.g. in some cases of *Alport’s syndrome and *Berger’s nephropathy.

Thought block is a common symptom in severe mental illness but may also arise in the context of *psychosis, severe anxiety, or depression.

thought broadcast a symptom of psychosis in which the patient feels that his or her thoughts are being distributed into other people’s thoughts. It must be differentiated from a mere idea that others can read one’s mind, which is common. Thought broadcast requires the conviction of an active transmission of thoughts. This is a *Schneiderian first-rank symptom, highly indicative of schizophrenia.

thought echo (echo de la pensée) a symptom of psychosis in which the patient has a hallucination of hearing aloud his or her own thoughts a short time after thinking them. Similar to the experience of thought echo is that of Gedankenlautwerden, in which the patients hear their own thoughts aloud at the time they think them. The latter was an original *Schneiderian first-rank symptom, but has been left out of most translations of Schneider’s work into English.

thought insertion a symptom of psychosis in which the patient feels that thoughts are inserted into his or her own head by an outside force or agency. This is a *Schneiderian first-rank symptom, highly indicative of schizophrenia.

thought-stopping n. a technique of *behaviour therapy used in the treatment of obsessional thoughts. Attention is voluntarily withdrawn from these thoughts and focused on some other vivid image or engrossing activity.

threadworm (pinworm) n. a parasitic nematode worm of the genus Enterobius (Oxyuris), which lives in the upper part of the human large intestine. The threadlike female worm, some 12 mm long, is larger than the male; it emerges from the anus in the evening to deposit its eggs, and later dies. If the eggs are swallowed and reach the intestine they develop directly into adult worms. Threadworms cause *enterobiasis, a disease common in children throughout the world.

3-D magnetic imager an instrument that harnesses magnetic technology to give a virtual image of an endoscope during colonoscopy. It aids steering and minimalizes looping of the endoscope.

threonine n. an *essential amino acid. See also amino acid.

threshold n. (in neurology) the point at which a stimulus begins to evoke a response, and therefore a measure of the sensitivity of a system under particular conditions. A *thermoreceptor that responds to an increase in temperature of only two degrees is said to have a much lower threshold than one that will only respond to a change in temperature of ten degrees or more. In this example the threshold can be measured directly in terms of degrees.

thrill n. a vibration felt on placing the hand on the body. A heart murmur that is felt by placing the hand on the chest wall is said to be accompanied by a thrill.

thromboangiitis obliterans see Buerger’s disease.

thrombocyte n. see platelet.

thrombocythaemia n. a disease in which there is an abnormal proliferation of the cells that produce blood *platelets (*megakaryocytes), leading to an increased number of platelets in the blood. This may result in an increased tendency to form clots within blood vessels (thrombosis); alternatively the function of the platelets may be abnormal, leading to an increased tendency to bleed. Treatment is by radiotherapy, *cytotoxic drugs, *interferon, or drugs that inhibit *megakaryocyte maturation.

thrombocytopenia n. a reduction in the number of *platelets in the blood. This results in bleeding into the skin (see purpura), spontaneous bruising, and prolonged bleeding after injury. Thrombocytopenia may result from failure of platelet production or excessive destruction of platelets. —thrombocytopenic adj.

thrombocytosis n. an increase in the number of *platelets in the blood. It may occur in a variety of diseases, including chronic infections, cancers, and certain blood diseases and is likely to cause an increased tendency to form blood clots within vessels (thrombosis).

thromboembolism n. the condition in which a blood clot (thrombus), formed at one point in the circulation, becomes detached and lodges at another point. It is most commonly applied to the association of phlebothrombosis and *pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thromboembolic disease).

thromboendarterectomy n. see endarterectomy.

thromboendarteritis n. thrombosis complicating *endarteritis, seen in temporal *arteritis, *polyarteritis nodosa, and syphilis. It may cause death of part of the organ supplied by the affected artery.

Inherited thrombophilias are established causes of systemic thrombosis due to defects in proteins involved in regulating *blood coagulation. Causes include *Factor V Leiden gene mutation, a *prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in proteins C and S and antithrombin III, and hyperhomocysteinaemia (see homocysteine). —thrombophilic adj.

thrombophlebitis n. inflammation of the wall of a vein (see phlebitis) with secondary thrombosis occurring within the affected segment of vein. Pregnant women are more prone to thrombophlebitis because of physiological changes in the blood and the effects of pressure within the abdomen. It may involve superficial or deep veins of the legs (the latter being less common in pregnancy than the former). Deep vein *thrombosis may precede *pulmonary embolism.

thromboplastin (tissue factor, Factor III, thrombokinase) n. a substance formed during the earlier stages of *blood coagulation. It acts as an enzyme, converting the inactive substance prothrombin to the enzyme *thrombin.

thrombopoiesis n. the process of blood *platelet production. Platelets are formed as fragments of cytoplasm shed from giant cells (*megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow by a budding process.

thromboprophylaxis n. measures taken to reduce the risk of venous *thrombosis and therefore avoid *thromboembolism during hospitalization. Techniques include tight support stockings to minimize venous stasis and subcutaneous injections of a *low-molecular-weight heparin to thin the blood.

thrombosis n. a condition in which the blood changes from a liquid to a solid state within the cardiovascular system during life and produces a mass of coagulated blood (thrombus). Thrombosis may occur within a blood vessel in diseased states. Thrombosis in an artery obstructs the blood flow to the tissue it supplies: obstruction of an artery to the brain is one of the causes of a *stroke and thrombosis in an artery supplying the heart – *coronary thrombosis – results in a heart attack (see myocardial infarction). Thrombosis can also occur in a vein (deep vein thrombosis; see phlebothrombosis), and it may be associated with inflammation (see thrombophlebitis). The thrombus may become detached from its site of formation and carried in the blood to lodge in another part (see embolism).

thrombotic microangiopathy the formation of thrombi in arterioles and capillaries, leading to haemolytic anaemia and *thrombocytopenia. The term encompasses primary *haemolytic uraemic syndrome and *thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as the microangiopathies that can complicate pregnancy (pregnancy-related haemolytic uraemic syndrome, *HELLP syndrome), *malignant hypertension, *scleroderma, *antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, organ transplantation, and cancer.

thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) a rare disorder of coagulation caused by deficiency or inhibition of *ADAMTS13, a protein that is responsible for breaking down von Willebrand factor (see von Willebrand’s disease). This results in haemolytic *anaemia, *thrombocytopenia, and fluctuating neurological abnormalities. It is treated by *plasmapheresis.

thromboxane A2 (TXA2) a substance related to prostaglandins that is released by platelets activated by local tissue injury and promotes blood clotting and vasconstriction. See platelet activation. Compare prostacyclin.

The thymus is enclosed in a capsule and divided internally by cross walls into many lobules, each full of T lymphocytes (white blood cells associated with antibody production). In relation to body size the thymus is largest at birth. It doubles in size by puberty, after which it gradually shrinks, its functional tissue being replaced by fatty tissue. In infancy the thymus controls the development of *lymphoid tissue and the immune response to microbes and foreign proteins (accounting for allergic response, autoimmunity, and the rejection of organ transplants). T lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they mature and differentiate until activated by antigen. —thymic adj.

These have characteristic presentations and degrees of malignancy, ranging from the papillary tumours, which tend to be relatively low-grade and in some cases can be treated by surgery and thyroxine suppression, to highly aggressive anaplastic tumours, which tend to present with locally advanced disease that is inoperable and unresponsive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. See also Hürthle cell tumour.

thyroid cartilage the main cartilage of the *larynx, consisting of two broad plates that join at the front to form a V-shaped structure. The thyroid cartilage forms the Adam’s apple in front of the larynx.

It often follows infections, childbirth, nonthyroid surgery, or trauma but can occur without an obvious cause. The presenting features are a fever, severe agitation, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pains. An accelerated heart rate and irregularity of the heart rhythm can cause heart failure, and psychotic episodes or coma can result. Blood tests will reveal hyperthyroidism and may also show altered liver function, high blood sugar, high calcium levels, a high white blood cell count, and often anaemia. Treatment is with intravenous fluids, oxygen, antithyroid drugs (such as *carbimazole or *propylthiouracil), high-dose iodide solution (see Lugol’s solution), high-dose steroids, and beta blockers. The patient must be cooled and given antipyretics, such as paracetamol. Any underlying cause must also be treated.

thyroidectomy n. surgical removal of the thyroid gland. In partial thyroidectomy, only the diseased part of the gland is removed (e.g. one lobe); in subtotal thyroidectomy, a method of treating *thyrotoxicosis due to Graves’ disease, the surgeon removes approximately 90% of the gland.

thyroid gland a large *endocrine gland situated in the base of the neck (see illustration). It consists of two lobes, one on either side of the trachea, that are joined by an isthmus (sometimes a third lobe extends upwards from the isthmus). The thyroid gland consists of a large number of closed follicles inside which is a jelly-like colloid, which contains *thyroglobulin and the principal active substances that are secreted by the gland. The thyroid gland is concerned with regulation of the metabolic rate by the secretion of *thyroid hormone, which is stimulated by *thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland and requires trace amounts of iodine. The *C cells of the thyroid gland secrete *calcitonin.

Position of the thyroid gland.





thyroid hormone an iodine-containing substance, synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland, that is essential for normal metabolic processes and mental and physical development. There are two thyroid hormones, *triiodothyronine and *thyroxine, which are formed from *thyroglobulin. Lack of these hormones gives rise to *cretinism in infants and *myxoedema in adults. Excessive production of thyroid hormones gives rise to *thyrotoxicosis.

thyroiditis n. inflammation of the thyroid gland. Acute thyroiditis is due to bacterial infection, and subacute (or de Quervain’s) thyroiditis is caused by a viral infection. Chronic thyroiditis is commonly caused by an abnormal immune response (see autoimmunity) in which lymphocytes invade the tissues of the gland. See Hashimoto’s disease.

thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine, T4) n. the principal hormone synthesized and secreted into the bloodstream by the thyroid gland (see thyroid hormone). Most of it is converted to a more metabolically active form, *triiodothyronine, within the peripheral tissues. Both hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate. A preparation of thyroxine (levothyroxine sodium) can be administered by mouth to treat underactivity of the thyroid gland.

Tinel’s sign a method for checking the regeneration of a nerve: usually used in patients with *carpal tunnel syndrome. Direct tapping over the sheath of the nerve elicits a distal tingling sensation (see paraesthesia), which indicates the beginning of regeneration. [J. Tinel (1879–1952), French neurosurgeon]

tinnitus n. the sensation of sounds in the ears, head, or around the head in the absence of an external sound source. It can occur with any form of hearing loss or with normal hearing. It is thought to be due to a misinterpretation of signals in the central auditory pathways of the brain. The signals that are misinterpreted can arise in any part of the auditory system: the cochlea, cochlear nerve, or within the brain itself. Treatment includes the correction of any underlying condition, counselling, *cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness meditation, acceptance and commitment therapy, relaxation techniques, sound therapy (see white noise instrument), and use of *hearing aids. A unified method of treatment that makes use of several of these components is referred to as *tinnitus retraining therapy. See also musical tinnitus; pulsatile tinnitus.

It consists of a body and a root, which is attached by muscles to the hyoid bone below, the styloid process behind, and the palate above. It is covered by mucous membrane, which is continuous with that of the mouth and pharynx. On the undersurface of the tongue a fold of mucous membrane, the frenulum linguae, connects the midline of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The surface of the tongue is covered with minute projections (papillae), which give it a furred appearance (see illustration). *Taste buds are arranged in grooves around the papillae, particularly the fungiform and circumvallate papillae. The tongue has three main functions.

It is usually a side-effect of medication but may also occur in patients with severe deficiency of potassium or magnesium or inherited abnormalities of the cardiac electrical system. See long QT syndrome.

torsion n. twisting. Abnormal twisting of a testis within the scrotum or of a loop of bowel in the abdomen may impair blood and nerve supplies to these parts and cause severe damage.

torticollis (wryneck) n. an irresistible turning movement of the head that becomes more persistent, so that eventually the head is held continually to one side. This is a form of *dystonia; the spasm of the muscles is often painful. It may be caused by a birth injury to the sternomastoid muscle (see sternomastoid tumour).

Tourette’s syndrome (TS, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome) a condition characterized by the simultaneous appearance of verbal and motor *tics within one year. Motor tics can be simple (eye rolling, flicking, incomplete movements) or complex (involuntary movements consisting of several components, mostly involving the arms). Verbal tics can be simple (grunts, throat clearing) or complex (uttering of words or, in 30% of patients, involuntary obscene speech). Rarely, the patient may also involuntarily repeat the words or imitate the actions of others (see palilalia). The condition usually starts in childhood and commonly improves with age. The prevalence is about 1% with a male preponderance. There is a strong hereditary element. Drug treatment and psychological support are sometimes helpful. [G. Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), French neurologist]

tourniquet n. a device to press upon an artery and prevent flow of blood through it, usually a cord, rubber tube, or tight bandage bound around a limb. Tourniquets are no longer recommended as a first-aid measure to stop bleeding from a wound because of the danger of reducing the supply of oxygen to other tissues (direct pressure on the wound itself is considered less harmful). However, a temporary tourniquet to increase the distension of veins when a sample of blood is being taken does no harm.

tow n. the teased-out short fibres of flax, hemp or jute, used in swabs for cleaning, in *packs or *stupes for the application of poultices, and for a variety of other purposes.

toxicosis n. the deleterious effects of a toxin; poisoning: includes any disease caused by the toxic effects of any substances.

toxic shock syndrome a state of acute *shock due to *septicaemia. The commonest cause is a retained foreign body (e.g. a tampon or IUCD) combined with the presence of staphylococci (see also streptococcal toxic shock syndrome). The condition can be life-threatening if not treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care (including fluid and electrolyte replacement).

toxin n. a poison produced by a living organism, especially by a bacterium (see endotoxin; exotoxin). In the body toxins act as *antigens, and special *antibodies (antitoxins) are formed to neutralize their effects.

Toxocara n. a genus of large nematode worms that are intestinal parasites of vertebrates. T. canis and T. cati, the common roundworms of dogs and cats respectively, have life cycles similar to that of the human roundworm, *Ascaris lumbricoides. See toxocariasis.

toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans) n. an infestation with the larvae of the dog and cat roundworms, Toxocara canis and T. cati. Humans, who are not the normal hosts, become infected on swallowing eggs of Toxocara present on hands or in food and drink contaminated with the faeces of infected domestic pets. The larvae, which migrate around the body, cause destruction of various tissues; the liver becomes enlarged and the lungs inflamed (see pneumonitis). Symptoms may include fever, joint and muscle pains, vomiting, an irritating rash, and convulsions. Larvae can also lodge in the retina of the eye where they cause inflammation and *granuloma. The disease, widely distributed throughout the world, primarily affects children. Treatment is with mebendazole.

toxoid n. a poisonous material (toxin), such as that produced by tetanus and diphtheria agents, that has been rendered harmless by chemical treatment while retaining its antigenic activity. Toxoids are used in *vaccines.

Toxoplasma n. a genus of crescent-shaped sporozoans that live as parasites within the cells of various tissues and organs of vertebrate animals, especially birds and mammals, and complete their life cycle in a single host, the cat. T. gondii infects sheep, cattle, dogs, and humans, sometimes provoking an acute illness (see toxoplasmosis).

toxoplasmosis n. a disease of mammals and birds caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, which is usually transmitted to humans through ingesting undercooked meat or food or drink contaminated with the faeces of infected cats. Generally symptoms are mild (swollen lymph nodes and an influenza-like illness), but the disease can be serious in immunocompromised patients and requires treatment with a combination of *pyrimethamine and *sulfadiazine. Infection usually confers lifelong immunity. If acquired during pregnancy it can cause congenital toxoplasmosis in the unborn baby. Although most babies are unaffected or have very mild disease, some can have severe malformations of the skull and eyes or active infection in the liver. It can also cause stillbirth. Infection can be detected by blood tests in the mother; if the diagnosis is confirmed, the mother can be treated with spiramycin.

tPA (TPA) see tissue-type plasminogen activator.

TPN see total parenteral nutrition.

Tpot an acronym for the potential doubling time, the time taken for a tumour to double its cells in the absence of cell loss (i.e. by radiation). It is related to the rate constant for cell production (kP), where kP = log2/Tpot, and enables direct measurement of the rate of cell proliferation by tumours.

trabecula n. (pl. trabeculae) 1. any of the bands of tissue that pass from the outer part of an organ to its interior, dividing it into separate chambers. For example, trabeculae occur in the penis. 2. any of the thin bars of bony tissue in spongy *bone. 3. the hypertrophied bands of bladder-wall muscle that are found in bladder outlet obstruction.

—trabecular adj.

trabecular meshwork the tissue, located in the anterior chamber of the eye at the angle between the cornea and iris, that consists of a group of tiny canals through which aqueous fluid drains into *Schlemm’s canal and exits the anterior chamber.

trabeculectomy n. an operation for glaucoma in which a part of the *trabecular meshwork is removed. This allows aqueous fluid to filter out of the eye under the conjunctiva, thus reducing the pressure inside the eye.

trabeculoplasty n. a method used to selectively destroy parts of the *trabecular meshwork and hence reduce intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma. This may be achieved by means of a laser, as in argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT; see argon laser) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), in which a YAG laser is used to selectively target melanin within the pigmented trabecular meshwork cells to achieve lowering of the intraocular pressure.

trace element an element that is required in minute concentrations for normal growth and development; the body contains a total of <5 g of the element. Trace elements include fluorine (see fluoride), manganese, *zinc, copper, *iodine, cobalt, *selenium, molybdenum, *chromium, and silicon. They may serve as *cofactors or as constituents of complex molecules (e.g. cobalt in vitamin B12).

tracer n. a substance that is introduced into the body and whose progress can subsequently be followed so that information is gained about metabolic processes. Radioactive tracers, which are substances labelled with *radionuclides, give off radiation that can be detected on a *scintigram or with a *gamma camera. They are used for a variety of purposes in *nuclear medicine. See MUGA scan; positron emission tomography; SPECT scanning.

trache- (tracheo-) combining form denoting the trachea.

trachea n. the windpipe: the part of the air passage between the *larynx and the main *bronchi, i.e. from just below the Adam’s apple, passing behind the notch of the *sternum (breastbone) to behind the angle of the sternum. The upper part of the trachea lies just below the skin, except where the thyroid gland is wrapped around it. —tracheal adj.

tracheal tugging a sign that is indicative of an *aneurysm of the aortic arch: a pulsatile downward tug is felt on the windpipe when the finger is placed in the midline at the root of the neck.

tracheitis n. inflammation of the *trachea, usually secondary to bacterial or viral infection in the nose or throat. Tracheitis causes soreness in the chest and a painful cough and is often associated with bronchitis. In babies it can cause asphyxia, particularly in *diphtheria. Treatment includes appropriate antibacterial drugs, humidification of the inhaled air or oxygen, and mild sedation to relieve exhaustion due to persistent coughing.

trachelectomy n. radical removal of the cervix in cases of cervical cancer when the women have not completed childbearing.

tracheoplasty n. a surgical procedure to widen the trachea in patients who have narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea.

tracheostomy (tracheotomy) n. a surgical operation in which a hole is made into the *trachea through the neck to relieve obstruction to breathing, as in diphtheria. A curved metal, plastic, or rubber tube is usually inserted through the hole and held in position by tapes tied round the neck. It may be possible for the patient to speak by occluding the opening with the fingers. The tube must be kept clean and unblocked. Tracheostomy is also used in conjunction with artificial respiration, when it serves not only to secure the airway but also provides a route for sucking out secretions and protects the airway against the inhalation of pharyngeal contents. See also minitracheostomy.

tracheotomy n. see tracheostomy.

trachoma n. a chronic contagious eye disease – a severe form of *conjunctivitis – caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis; it is common in some hot countries. The conjunctiva of the eyelids becomes inflamed, leading to discharge of pus. If untreated, the conjunctiva becomes scarred and shrinks, causing the eyelids to turn inwards so that the eyelashes scratch the cornea (*trichiasis); blindness can be a late complication. Treatment with tetracyclines is effective in the early stages of the disease.

tract n. 1. a group of nerve fibres passing from one part of the brain or spinal cord to another, forming a distinct pathway, e.g. the spinothalamic tract, pyramidal tract, and corticospinal tract. 2. an organ or collection of organs providing for the passage of something, e.g. the digestive tract.

traction n. the application of a pulling force, especially as a means of counteracting the natural tension in the tissues surrounding a broken bone (see countertraction), to produce correct alignment of the fragments. Considerable force, exerted with weights, ropes, and pulleys, may be necessary to ensure that a broken femur is kept correctly positioned during the early stages of healing. Traction is also used for the treatment of back pain by physiotherapists.

tractography n. a *magnetic resonance imaging technique using *diffusion tensor imaging to show the direction of the main nerve tracts in the brain and their connections.

tractotomy n. a neurosurgical operation for the relief of intractable pain. The nerve fibres that carry painful sensation to consciousness travel from the spinal cord through the brainstem in the spinothalamic tracts. This procedure is designed to sever the tracts within the medulla oblongata. See also cordotomy.

tragus n. the projection of cartilage in the *pinna of the outer ear that extends back over the opening of the external auditory meatus. It is used as a reference point in orthodontic measurements.

tramadol n. an opioid analgesic (see opiate) used for the relief of moderate or severe pain. It causes less respiratory depression, constipation, and likelihood of dependence than other opioids.

TRAM flap transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous *flap: a piece of tissue (skin, muscle, and fat) dissected from the abdomen, between the umbilicus and pubis, and used to reconstruct the breast after mastectomy. The flap of tissue is dissected along with its blood supply and moved into its new position on this pedicle.

trance n. a state in which reaction to the environment is diminished although awareness is not impaired. It can be caused by hypnosis, meditation, catatonia, conversion disorder, drugs (such as hallucinogens), and religious ecstasy.

tranexamic acid a drug that prevents the breakdown of blood clots in the circulation (*fibrinolysis) by blocking the activation of plasminogen to form *plasmin, i.e. it is an antifibrinolytic drug. It is administered as an antidote to overdosage by *fibrinolytic drugs and to control severe bleeding, for example after surgery or to treat menorrhagia. Possible side-effects include nausea and vomiting.

tranquillizer n. a drug that produces a calming effect, relieving anxiety and tension. *Antipsychotic drugs (formerly known as major tranquillizers) have this effect and are used to treat severe mental disorders (psychoses), including schizophrenia and mania. *Anxiolytic drugs (formerly known as minor tranquillizers) are used to relieve anxiety and tension due to various causes.

trans- prefix denoting through or across. Example: transurethral (through the urethra).

transaminase n. an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an α-keto acid in the process of *transamination. Examples include *aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which catalyses the transamination of glutamate and oxaloacetate to α-ketoglutarate and aspartate, and *alanine aminotransferase (ALT), converting glutamate and pyruvate to α-ketoglutarate and alanine.

transamination n. a process involved in the metabolism of amino acids in which amino groups (–NH2) are transferred from amino acids to certain α-keto acids, with the production of a second keto acid and amino acid. The reaction is catalysed by enzymes (see transaminase), which require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme.

transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) a minimally invasive surgical procedure for rectal polyps not suitable for colonoscopic resection. For early rectal cancer it can be an alternative to lower anterior resection of the rectum. The procedure is performed through the anus and rectum using an *operating microscope and microsurgical instruments.

transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) an *interventional radiology procedure to treat liver cancer in which a chemotherapeutic agent (usually doxyrubicin) loaded onto tiny beads is directly delivered to the cancerous area. This involves passing a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin and selectively placing it into the hepatic artery. A minute catheter (microcatheter) is then placed through the existing catheter and advanced more selectively into the area of cancer. Thus, the chemotherapy-loaded beads can be administered directly to the cancer, where they can not only treat it but also block the blood supply to that area (*embolization).

transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) replacement of the aortic valve in patients with *aortic stenosis using a catheter-delivered prosthesis rather than open heart surgery. Usually the catheter is passed via the femoral artery, but sometimes it can be passed via the subclavian artery or through the wall of the left ventricle via a localized *thoracotomy.

transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) an operation, which is performed under local anaesthetic, in which the membrane lining the uterus (see endometrium) is cut away by a form of *electrosurgery using a *resectoscope, which is introduced through the cervix. Like *endometrial ablation, TCRE is used as an alternative to hysterectomy to treat abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding as it results in fewer complications and shorter stays in hospital.

transcoelomic spread a route of tumour *metastasis across a body cavity, such as the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cavity. Transcoelomic spread commonly occurs in advanced cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, ovary, and endometrium. It may be associated with the development of a malignant *effusion.

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimulation of the brain by strong magnetic fields that induce electric currents in the underlying brain tissue. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), consisting of a series of TMS pulses, is used to treat depression. Its clinical utility is controversial, with inconsistent research results regarding its efficacy. Although there have been some small studies regarding its use with other conditions, such as OCD, rTMS is not currently used routinely in the treatment for any illness other than depression.

transcription n. the process in which the information contained in the *genetic code is transferred from DNA to RNA: the first step in the manufacture of proteins in cells. See messenger RNA; translation.

transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) the introduction of pulses of low-voltage electricity into tissue for the relief of pain. It is effected by means of a small portable battery-operated unit with leads connected to electrodes attached to the skin; the strength and frequency of the pulses, which prevent the passage of pain impulses to the brain, can be adjusted by the patient. TENS is used mainly for the relief of rheumatic pain and as analgesia during labour.

transducer n. a device used to convert one form of signal into another, allowing its measurement or display to be made appropriately. For example, an *ultrasound probe converts reflected ultrasound waves into electronic impulses, which can be displayed on a TV monitor.

transduction n. the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another by means of a *bacteriophage (phage). Some bacterial DNA is incorporated into the phage. When the host bacterium is destroyed the phage infects another bacterium and introduces the DNA from its previous host, which may become incorporated into the new host’s DNA.

transection n. 1. a cross section of a piece of tissue. 2. cutting across the tissue of an organ (see also section).

transfection n. the direct transfer of DNA molecules into a cell.

transferase n. an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a group (other than hydrogen) between a pair of substrates.

transference n. (in psychoanalysis) the process by which a patient comes to feel and act towards the therapist as though he or she were somebody from the patient’s past life, especially a powerful parent. The patient’s transference feelings may be of love or of hatred, but they are inappropriate to the actual person of the therapist. Countertransference is the reaction of the therapist to the patient, which is similarly based on past relationships.

transferrin (siderophilin) n. a *glycoprotein, found in the blood plasma, that is capable of binding iron and thus acts as a carrier for iron in the bloodstream.

transfer RNA a type of RNA whose function is to attach the correct amino acid to the protein chain being synthesized at a *ribosome. See also translation.

transformation zone the area of the *cervix of the uterus where the squamous epithelium, which covers the vaginal portion of the cervix, joins with the columnar epithelium, which forms the lining (endocervix) of the cervical canal.

transforming growth factor (TGF) a protein – a *cytokine – that controls growth, proliferation, and other functions in most cells. It plays a role in asthma and other respiratory diseases and is also involved in diseases elsewhere in the body. There are two classes: TGF-α and TGF-β.

transfusion n. 1. the injection of a volume of blood obtained from a healthy person (the donor) into the circulation of a patient (the recipient) whose blood is deficient in quantity or quality, through accident or disease. Direct transfusion from one person to another is rarely performed; usually packs of carefully stored blood of different *blood groups are kept in *blood banks for use as necessary. Before a blood transfusion the recipient’s blood type is tested so that only blood that is compatible will be transfused to reduce potentially life-threatening transfusion reactions. During transfusion the blood is allowed to drip, under gravity, through a needle inserted into one of the recipient’s veins. Blood transfusion is routine during major surgical operations in which much blood is likely to be lost. 2. the administration of any fluid, such as plasma or saline solution, into a patient’s vein by means of a *drip. See also autotransfusion.

transgender adj. describing the condition of one who firmly believes that he or she belongs to the gender opposite to his or her biological sex. A transgender person will often seek gender reassignment, i.e. to be legally recognized as belonging to the gender opposite to that on his or her birth certificate. The transition may involve hormone treatment and/or surgery but there is no requirement for this. Under current UK law, the person must supply evidence that he or she has been medically diagnosed with *gender dysphoria, has lived in his or her acquired gender for the past two years, and intends to remain in it until death. A proposed reform to the law would replace this process with one of simple self-declaration (although this idea has aroused some opposition). ‘Transgender’ is now preferred to the older term transsexual, as this refers more narrowly to those who have undergone surgery to change gender. See also gender dysphoria.

transhepatic adj. through the liver: describing a procedure or investigation in which access to the biliary system is gained by this route (e.g. *percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography).

transient ischaemic attack (TIA) the result of temporary disruption of the circulation to part of the brain due to *embolism, *thrombosis to brain arteries, or spasm of the vessel walls (see stroke). The most common symptoms are transient loss of vision in one eye and weakness or numbness in one limb or part of a limb. Patients recover within 24 hours.

transillumination n. the technique of shining a bright light through part of the body to examine its structure. Transillumination of the sinuses of the skull is a means of detecting abnormalities.

transitional cell carcinoma a form of cancer that affects the urothelium, which lines the urinary collecting system of the kidney, ureters, bladder, and the proximal part of the urethra. It is the most common type of bladder cancer.

transjugular adj. through the jugular vein: a route commonly taken to gain access to the venous system to place lines or undertake interventions (e.g. IVC filter insertion and transjugular liver biopsies).

translation n. (in cell biology) the manufacture of proteins in a cell, which takes place at the ribosomes. The information for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in the protein is carried to the ribosomes by *messenger RNA, and the amino acids are brought to their correct position in the protein by *transfer RNA.

translational research a type of scientific enquiry that focuses on developing practical application from the findings from basic scientific research. The field of translational research is sometimes described as comprising T1 research and T2 research. The former focuses on developing novel clinical treatments from laboratory-based basic science; the latter on embedding the findings of clinical trials into everyday practice. See also academic health science network.

translocation n. (in genetics) a type of chromosome mutation in which a part of a chromosome is transferred to another part of the same chromosome or to a different chromosome. This changes the order of the genes on the chromosomes and can lead to serious genetic disorders, e.g. chronic myeloid leukaemia.

transmethylation n. the process whereby an amino acid donates its terminal methyl (−CH3) group for the methylation of other compounds. Methionine is the principal methyl donor in the body and the donated methyl group may subsequently be involved in the synthesis of such compounds as choline or creatinine or in detoxification processes.

transmigration n. the act of passing through or across, e.g. the passage of blood cells through the intact walls of capillaries and venules (see diapedesis).

transmural myocardial infarction a *myocardial infarction that involves the full thickness of the left ventricular wall.

transobturator tape (TOT) see tension-free vaginal tape.

transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) see echocardiography.

trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) a form of robot-assisted surgery used for treating difficult-to-access tumours of the pharynx and larynx.

transplantation n. the implantation of an organ or tissue (see graft) from one part of the body to another or from one person (the donor) to another (the recipient). Success for transplantation depends on the degree of compatibility between donor and graft: it is greatest for *autografts (self-grafts), less for *allografts (between individuals of the same species), and least for *xenografts (between different species; see xenotransplantation). Skin and bone grafting are examples of transplantation techniques in the same individual. A kidney transplant involves the grafting of a healthy kidney from a donor to replace the diseased kidney of the recipient: renal transplantation is the second commonest example of human transplant surgery using allografts (after corneal grafts – see keratoplasty). Bone-marrow, blood-stem-cell, heart, heart–lung, pancreatic, and liver transplants are also very successful. Patients have undergone laryngeal transplantation following *laryngectomy. Transplanting organs or tissues between individuals is a difficult procedure because the recipient’s immune system perceives the transplant as a foreign object and rejects it. Special treatment (e.g. with *immunosuppressant drugs) is needed to prevent transplant rejection, and the less common but equally devastating effects of an attack by the graft’s immune cells on the host.

Ethical questions arise over donated organs. If the donor is living, is the organ properly a *gift? If the donor has recently died, how has the death been judged and has *consent been given explicitly by the patient or surviving relatives (opting in) or is it assumed if the donor has not forbidden it (opting out)?

transposition n. the abnormal positioning of a part of the body such that it is on the opposite side to its normal site in the body. For example, it may involve the heart (see dextrocardia).

transposition of the great vessels a congenital abnormality of the heart in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. Life is impossible unless there is an additional abnormality, such as a septal defect, that permits the mixing of blood between the pulmonary and systemic (aortic) circulations. Few of those untreated survive infancy and childhood, but the defect may be improved or corrected surgically. In congenitally corrected transposition, it is in fact the ventricles that are transposed rather than the great vessels. Thus the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, as in uncorrected transposition, but in this case the blood flow in the systemic and pulmonary circulations follows the normal routes.

transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) an *ultrasonography technique for examination of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by placing an ultrasound probe through the anus to lie directly behind these structures in the rectum. Because of the close proximity of the probe, excellent detail is seen. The technique enables transrectal or transperineal biopsies of the prostate to be taken in a systematic manner in the diagnosis of cancer. See also vesiculography.

transseptal puncture a procedure in which, under X-ray guidance, a sharp-tipped catheter positioned in the heart is used to create a small hole in the partition (septum) separating the atria. This allows other catheters to be passed from the right to the left atrium for the purposes of pressure measurement, *ablation, or *valvuloplasty.

transsexual n. see transgender.

transthoracic impedance resistance to the flow of electricity through the heart muscle during *defibrillation due to the thoracic structures lying between the defibrillation paddles and the heart. These structures include the skin and soft subcutaneous tissues, the ribs and sternum, the lungs, and the pericardium. The best way to reduce the impedance, and thus to deliver the maximum available current to the heart, is to use defibrillation gel pads (see coupling agents), to deliver the shock when the lungs are empty of air, or to press firmly down if using hand-held paddles. Transthoracic impedance is usually between 70 and 80 ohms.

transtympanic adj. across the eardrum. This can refer to the injection of medication through the eardrum into the middle ear cavity (see intratympanic) to treat conditions of the inner ear or the insertion of an electrode through the eardrum to perform *electrocochleography.

transudation n. the passage of a liquid through a membrane, especially of blood through the wall of a capillary vessel. The liquid is called the transudate.

transuretero-ureterostomy n. the operation of connecting one ureter to the other in the abdomen. The damaged/obstructed ureter is cut above the diseased or damaged segment and joined end-to-side to the other ureter.

transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) see resection.

transurethral vaporization of the prostate (TUVP) a technique that vaporizes (rather than resects) prostate tissue; it is associated with less bleeding during the procedure. TUVP is used to treat *lower urinary tract symptoms thought to be due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see prostate gland) or urinary retention.

transvaginal tape (TVT) see tension-free vaginal tape.

transvaginal ultrasonography an *ultrasonography technique for examination of the female pelvis using a vaginal probe instead of an abdominal transducer. It allows the use of a higher frequency, thus providing superior resolution and therefore a more detailed anatomy of the female pelvis and an earlier and more accurate identification of fetal structures.

transverse adj. (in anatomy) situated at right angles to the long axis of the body or an organ.

transverse process the long projection from the base of the neural arch of a *vertebra.

transvestism (cross-dressing) n. dressing in clothes normally associated with the opposite sex, which may occur in both heterosexual and homosexual people. Cross-dressing may be practised by transsexuals (see transgender), in whom it is not sexually arousing. Other transvestites are fetishistic, and in these cross-dressing is sexually arousing and may lead to masturbatory or other sexual behaviour. Treatment may be by behavioural techniques, such as *aversion therapy, but is not always needed. See also sexual deviation. —transvestite n.

Trantas dots slightly elevated greyish-white dots consisting of clumps of degenerating eosinophils and epithelial cells, seen on the conjunctiva at the junction of the cornea and sclera in cases of allergic conjunctivitis. [A. Trantas (1867–1960), Greek ophthalmologist]

tranylcypromine n. see MAO inhibitor.

trapezium n. a bone of the wrist (see carpus). It articulates with the scaphoid bone behind, with the first metacarpal in front, and with the trapezoid and second metatarsal on either side.

Left trapezius muscle.





trapezoid bone a bone of the wrist (see carpus). It articulates with the second metatarsal bone in front, with the scaphoid bone behind, and with the trapezium and capitate bones on either side.

trash foot a condition resulting from occlusion of the small arteries of the foot by atherosclerotic debris (see atheroma). This occurs during abdominal aortic surgery or catheter manipulation, for example during coronary angiography. Clinically it presents with pain and eventually patchy ulceration and gangrene of the whole or part of the foot.

trastuzumab n. a *monoclonal antibody used to treat types of breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer that are positive for *HER2: the drug binds to these receptors on the tumour. Side-effects include damage to the heart, chills, fever, and allergic reactions.

trauma n. 1. a physical wound or injury, such as a fracture or blow. Trauma scores are numerical systems for assessing the severity and prognosis of serious injuries. 2. (in psychology) an emotionally painful and harmful event. *Post-traumatic stress disorder may follow an overwhelmingly stressful event, such as battle, assault, or serious injury.

—traumatic adj.

traumatic brain injury (TBI) injury to the brain due to external force, such as occurs following falls, road traffic accidents, and violence. It is a major cause of death and chronic disability worldwide, especially in young males.

traumatic fever a fever resulting from a serious injury.

traumatology n. accident surgery: the branch of surgery that deals with wounds and disabilities arising from injuries.

travel sickness see motion sickness.

trazodone n. a drug, related to the tricyclic *antidepressants, that is used in the treatment of depression, particularly in agitated and anxious patients, and anxiety. Side-effects are milder than with tricyclic antidepressants.

Treacher Collins syndrome (Treacher Collins deformity) a hereditary disorder of facial development. It is characterized by underdevelopment of the jaw and zygomatic (cheek) bones and the precursors of the ear fail to develop, which results in a variety of ear and facial malformations. The ear abnormality may cause deafness. [E. Treacher Collins (1862–1919), British ophthalmologist]

treatment bias the making of decisions by a health-care provider based on (sometimes unconscious) nonmedical criteria. Examples include assuming that a woman’s physical complaints are ‘all in her head’ and neglecting to consider depression as a possible diagnosis in a man.

treatment field n. (in radiotherapy) an area of the body selected for treatment with radiotherapy. For example, a mantle field comprises the neck, armpits, and central chest, for the radiotherapy of Hodgkin’s disease. Radiation is administered to the defined area by focusing the beam of particles emitted by the radiotherapy machine and shielding the surrounding area of the body.

Treg cell see regulatory T cell.

trematode n. see fluke.

tremor n. a rhythmical and alternating movement that may affect any part of the body. The physiological tremor is a feature of the normal mechanism for maintaining posture. It may be more apparent in states of fatigue or anxiety or when the thyroid gland is overactive. Essential tremor is slower and particularly affects the hands and arms when held out or holding a teacup. It can be embarrassing and inconvenient but it is not accompanied by any other symptoms. A similar tremor may also occur in several members of one family and also in elderly people. Alcohol reduces the intensity of essential tremor. Treatment is with beta blockers, such as propanolol. Primary orthostatic tremor affects the legs when standing still, causing unsteadiness if the position is maintained. Resting tremor is a prominent symptom of *parkinsonism. An intention tremor occurs when a patient with disease of the cerebellum tries to touch an object. The closer the object is approached the wilder become the movements.

trench fever an infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Bartonella quintana and transmitted by body lice (*Pediculus humanus corporis). It was prevalent among soldiers during both World Wars and is now seen mainly in homeless people. Symptoms include variable fewer and persistent pain in the shins and other bones.

trench foot (immersion foot) blackening of the toes and the skin of the foot due to death of the superficial tissues and caused by prolonged immersion in cold water or exposure to damp and cold.

Trendelenburg position a special operating-table posture for patients undergoing surgery of the pelvis or for patients suffering from shock to reduce blood loss in operations on the legs. The patient is laid on his or her back with the pelvis higher than the head, inclined at an angle of about 45°. [F. Trendelenburg (1844–1924), German surgeon]

Trendelenburg’s test (Trendelenburg’s sign) a test for detecting dysfunction of the hip joint. Normally when a leg is lifted off the ground, the pelvis on the same side is raised by the hip abductor muscles on the other side. If these muscles cannot raise the pelvis against body weight, the pelvis will tilt downwards and the test is positive, indicating arthritis, paralysis of the muscles due to superior gluteal nerve injury, or other hip pathology (e.g. congenital hip dislocation). [F. Trendelenburg]

trephine n. a surgical instrument used to remove a circular area of tissue, usually from the cornea of the eye (in the operation of penetrating *keratoplasty) or from bone (for microscopical examination). It consists of a hollow tube with a serrated cutting edge. It is used during the preliminary stages of craniotomy.

Treponema n. a genus of anaerobic spirochaete bacteria. All species are parasitic and some cause disease in animals and humans: T. carateum causes *pinta, T. pallidum *syphilis, and T. pertenue *yaws.

treponematosis n. any infection caused by spirochaete bacteria of the genus Treponema. See pinta; syphilis; yaws.

trespass against the person see battery.

tretinoin n. a *retinoid drug applied as a solution for the treatment of acne and sun-damaged skin; side-effects include redness and burning of the skin and increased sensitivity to sunlight. It is also taken by mouth to treat acute promyelocytic leukaemia; side-effects may include fever, breathlessness, flushing, headache, and fetal abnormalities (it should not be taken during pregnancy).

triad n. (in medicine) a group of three united or closely associated structures or three symptoms or effects that occur together. A portal triad in a portal canal of the liver consists of a branch of the portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery, and an interlobular bile tubule.

triage n. a system whereby patients are evaluated and categorized according to the seriousness of their injuries or illnesses with a view to prioritizing treatment and other resources. In emergency situations it is designed to maximize the number of survivors.

triamcinolone n. a synthetic corticosteroid hormone that reduces inflammation but does not cause salt and water retention.

tuberculoma n. a mass of cheeselike material resembling a tumour, seen in some cases of *tuberculosis. Tuberculomas are found in a variety of sites, including the lung or brain, and a single mass may be the only clinical evidence of disease. Treatment is by surgical excision, together with antituberculous drugs.

tuberculosis (TB) n. an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (first identified by Koch in 1882) and characterized by the formation of nodular lesions (tubercles) in the tissues.

In pulmonary tuberculosis – formerly known as consumption and phthisis (wasting) – the bacillus is inhaled into the lungs where it sets up a primary tubercle and spreads to the nearest lymph nodes (the primary complex). Natural immune defences may heal it at this stage; alternatively the disease may smoulder for months or years and fluctuate with the patient’s resistance. Many people become infected but show no symptoms. Others develop a chronic infection and can transmit the bacillus by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms of the active disease include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and the spitting of blood. In some cases the bacilli spread from the lungs to the bloodstream, setting up millions of tiny tubercles throughout the body (miliary tuberculosis), or migrate to the meninges to cause tuberculous *meningitis. Bacilli entering by the mouth, usually in infected cows’ milk, set up a primary complex in abdominal lymph nodes, leading to *peritonitis, and sometimes spread to other organs, joints, and bones (see Pott’s disease).

Tuberculosis is curable by various combinations of the antibiotics *streptomycin, *ethambutol, *isoniazid (INH), *rifampicin, and *pyrazinamide. Preventive measures in the UK include the detection of cases by X-ray screening of vulnerable populations and vaccination with *BCG vaccine of those with no immunity to the disease (the *tuberculin test identifies which people require vaccination). The childhood immunization schedule no longer includes BCG vaccination at 10–14 years of age; vaccination now targets high-risk groups, such as immigrants from countries with a high incidence of TB. There has been a resurgence of tuberculosis in recent years in association with HIV infection. The number of patients with multidrug resistant TB has also increased due to patients not completing drug courses. Many centres have introduced directly observed therapy (DOT), in which nurse practitioners watch patients taking their drugs or administer the drugs.

tularaemia (rabbit fever) n. a disease of rodents and rabbits, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, that is transmitted to humans by deer flies (see Chrysops), by direct contact with infected animals, by contamination of wounds, or by drinking contaminated water. Symptoms include an ulcer at the site of infection, inflamed and ulcerating lymph nodes, headache, aching pains, loss of weight, and a fever lasting several weeks. Treatment with chloramphenicol, streptomycin, or tetracycline is effective.

tumbu fly a large non-bloodsucking fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga, widely distributed in tropical Africa. The female fly lays its eggs on ground contaminated with urine or excreta or on clothing tainted with sweat or urine. The maggots are normally parasites of rats, but if they come into contact with humans they penetrate the skin, producing boil-like swellings (see also myiasis). The maggots can be gently eased out by applying oil to the swellings.

twins pl. n. two individuals who are born at the same time and of the same parents. Fraternal (or dizygotic) twins are the result of the simultaneous fertilization of two egg cells; they may be of different sexes and are no more alike than ordinary siblings. Identical (or monozygotic) twins result from the fertilization of a single egg cell that subsequently divides to give two separate fetuses. They are of the same sex and otherwise genetically identical; any differences in their appearance are due to environmental influences. All dizygotic twins and about one-third of monozygotic twins are dichorionic (i.e. they develop within separate chorionic membranes). About two-thirds of monozygotic twins are monochorionic, sharing a chorion. See chorionicity. See also conjoined twins.

twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) a condition in which communicating vessels in the shared placenta of monochorionic twins (see chorionicity) divert blood to one fetus (the recipient) from the other (the donor), resulting in one fetus with increased blood volume and one anaemic fetus. It complicates 15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, and a system of ultrasound staging has been developed to assess the severity of the syndrome. TTTS is associated with a high perinatal mortality rate. There is significant morbidity and poor neurodevelopmental outcome in surviving infants due to complications of the disease itself and the high preterm birth rate that invariably accompanies this condition. A range of treatments, including *amnioreduction, *septostomy, and laser ablation of the communicating vessels, have led to an improvement in overall perinatal survival rates.

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.

It is formed from the outer wall of the lining of the tympanic cavity and the skin that lines the external auditory meatus. When sound waves reach the ear the tympanum vibrates, transmitting these vibrations to the malleus – one of the auditory *ossicles in the middle ear – to which it is attached.

tympanites (meteorism) n. distension of the abdomen with air or gas: the abdomen is resonant (drumlike) on *percussion. Causes include intestinal obstruction, functional bowel disorder, and *aerophagia.

tympanogram n. the graphic record of a test of middle ear function carried out on a *tympanometer.

tympanometer n. an apparatus for testing the pressure in the middle ear and the mobility of the *tympanic membrane. It is used in the diagnosis of *glue ear. —tympanometry n.

tympanoplasty n. surgical repair of defects of the eardrum and middle ear ossicles. See myringoplasty.

tympanotomy n. a surgical operation to expose the middle ear and allow access to the ossicles. It is usually performed by incising around the eardrum and turning it forwards.

tympanum n. the *middle ear (tympanic cavity) and/or the eardrum (*tympanic membrane).

typho- combining form denoting 1. typhoid fever. 2. typhus.

typhoid fever an infection of the digestive system by the bacterium Salmonella typhi, causing general weakness, headache, high fever, a rash (rose spots) on the chest and abdomen, chills, and sweating. In serious cases inflammation of the spleen and bones, delirium, and intestinal haemorrhage may occur. It is transmitted through food or drinking water contaminated by the faeces or urine of patients or carriers. Often recovery occurs naturally but relapses are common. Treatment is usually with antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone. Vaccines that provide temporary immunity are available. Compare paratyphoid fever.

typhus (spotted fever) n. any one of a group of infections caused by *rickettsiae and characterized by severe headache, a widespread rash, prolonged high fever, and delirium. They all respond to treatment with chloramphenicol or tetracyclines. Epidemic typhus (also known as classical or louse-borne typhus) is caused by infection with Rickettsia prowazekii transmitted by lice. It was formerly very prevalent in overcrowded insanitary conditions (as during wars and famines), with a mortality rate approaching 100%. Endemic typhus (murine or flea-borne typhus) is a disease of rats due to Rickettsia mooseri; it can be transmitted to humans by rat fleas, causing a mild typhus fever. There are in addition several kinds of tick typhus (in which the rickettsiae are transmitted by ticks), including *Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and typhus transmitted by mites (see rickettsial pox; scrub typhus).

tyramine n. an amine naturally occurring in cheese. It has a similar effect in the body to that of *adrenaline. This effect can be dangerous in patients taking *MAO inhibitors (antidepressants), in whom blood pressure may become very high. Cheese is therefore not advised when such drugs are prescribed.

Tyroglyphus n. see Acarus.

tyrosine n. see amino acid.

tyrosine kinase inhibitor any one of a class of drugs that interfere with cell growth in a variety of different ways by inhibiting the action of tyrosine kinases. This family of enzymes, which occur both within cells and as components of cell-membrane receptor sites, have an important role in cell division and cell growth. Many tumour cells have been shown to have both intracellular enzymes and extracellular receptor sites, and a variety of anticancer agents have been developed to inhibit enzyme activity at these sites. Among these drugs are *imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, used for treating chronic myeloid leukaemia; *sunitinib, for treating renal cell carcinoma; and erlotinib, for treating pancreatic cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. See also epidermal growth factor receptor.

tyrosinosis n. an inborn defect of metabolism of the amino acid tyrosine that causes excessive excretion of parahydroxyphenylpyruvic acid in the urine. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness.





u


ubiquinone n. a *coenzyme that acts as an electron transfer agent in the mitochondria of cells (see electron transport chain).

uE3 see unconjugated oestriol.

UGH syndrome *uveitis associated with *glaucoma and *hyphaema. This is an uncommon inflammatory condition occurring as a complication of intraocular lens *implants.

Uhthoff phenomenon the worsening of neurological symptoms, including vision, in demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis, when the body becomes overheated in hot weather or by exercise, fever, or saunas and hot tubs. [W. Uhthoff (1853–1927), German ophthalmologist]

UICC Union international contre le cancer: an international body promoting cancer prevention and treatment. It produces respected texts on the most important types of cancer, particularly on tumour staging classifications.

UIP usual *interstitial pneumonia. See also idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

UK National Screening Committee (NSC) the body responsible for advising the NHS, the ministers of the UK government, and the three devolved governments in the UK about all aspects of screening. The NSC also has responsibility for overseeing all noncancer screening programmes in the NHS in England and monitoring their quality and effectiveness. It was formed in 1996 and became part of *Public Health England in 2013. See screening test.

ulcer n. 1. a break in an epithelial surface. See also dendritic ulcer. 2. a break in the skin extending to all its layers, or a break in the mucous membrane lining the alimentary tract, that fails to heal and is often accompanied by inflammation. Of the many types of skin ulcer, the most common is the venous (or hypostatic) ulcer of the leg, known incorrectly as a varicose ulcer, which is caused by increased venous pressure and usually occurs in older women. See also arterial ulcer; pressure sore.

For ulcers of the alimentary tract, see aphthous ulcer; duodenal ulcer; gastric ulcer; peptic ulcer; stress ulcers.

ulcerative colitis inflammation and ulceration of the colon, initially starting in the rectum (see proctitis) but ascending to include a part or the whole of the colon (see colitis). Its cause is unknown. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rectal bleeding. Acute severe colitis requires urgent in-patient admission for intravenous steroids. Patients who fail to respond to these should be treated with second-line agents (such as infliximab or ciclosporin) or by surgical colectomy.

ulcerative gingivitis acute painful gingivitis with ulceration, in which the tissues of the gums are rapidly destroyed. Occurring mainly in debilitated patients, it is associated with anaerobic microorganisms (see Fusobacterium; Bacteroides) and is accompanied by an unpleasant odour. Treatment is with *metronidazole and a careful and thorough regime of oral hygiene supplemented with oxidizing mouthwashes. In the past ulcerative gingivitis has been called acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), Vincent stomatitis, or Vincent’s angina. A rare complication of severe ulcerative gingivitis is a *noma.

ule- (ulo-) combining form denoting 1. scars; scar tissue. 2. the gums.

ulipristal n. a synthetic female sex hormone – a *progestogen – used for *postcoital contraception. Because it blocks the action of progesterone, ulipristal is also taken orally to treat *fibroids.

ulna n. the inner and longer bone of the forearm (see illustration). It articulates with the humerus and radius above and with the radius and indirectly with the wrist bones below. At its upper end is the *olecranon process and *coronoid process; at the lower end is a cone-shaped styloid process. —ulnar adj.

Right ulna and radius (front view).





ulnar artery a branch of the brachial artery arising at the elbow and running deep within the muscles of the medial side of the forearm. It passes into the palm of the hand, where it unites with the arch of the radial artery and gives off branches to the hand and fingers.

ulnar nerve one of the major nerves of the arm. It originates in the neck, from spinal roots of the last cervical and first thoracic divisions, and runs down the inner side of the upper arm to behind the elbow. In the forearm it supplies the muscles with motor nerves; lower down it divides into branches that supply the skin of the palm and fourth and fifth fingers.

ultra- prefix denoting 1. beyond. 2. an extreme degree (e.g. of large or small size).

ultracentrifuge n. a *centrifuge that works at extremely high speeds of rotation: used for separating large molecules, such as proteins.

ultradian adj. denoting a biological rhythm or cycle that occurs more frequently than once in 24 hours. Compare circadian, nyctohemeral.

ultrafiltration n. filtration under pressure. In the kidney, blood is subjected to ultrafiltration to remove the unwanted water, urea, and other waste material that goes to make up urine.

ultramicroscope n. a microscope for examining particles suspended in a gas or liquid under intense illumination from one side. Light is scattered or reflected from the particles, which can be seen through the eyepiece as bright objects against a dark background.

ultramicrotome n. an instrument for cutting extremely thin sections of tissue (not more than 0.1 μm thick) for electron microscopy. See also microtome.

ultrasonics n. the study of the uses and properties of sound waves of very high frequency (see ultrasound). —ultrasonic adj.

ultrasonography (sonography) n. the use of *ultrasound to produce images of structures in the human body. The ultrasound probe sends out a short pulse of high-frequency sound and detects the reflected waves (echoes) occurring at interfaces within the organs. The direction of the pulse can then be moved across the area of interest with each pulse to build up a complete image. Scans may produce a single stationary image similar to a photograph (static) or multiple sequential images similar to a video (*real-time imaging). The ultrasound waves are transmitted from – and echoes detected by – piezoelectric crystals contained within the scanning probe (see transducer). As far as is known, there are no significant adverse effects from the use of ultrasound at diagnostic energies. Ultrasound waves are blocked by gas, as in the lungs and bowel, which can obscure underlying structures. The detail seen increases with the frequency of the ultrasound but the depth of penetration decreases. Ultrasonography is extensively used in obstetrics, including the diagnosis of pregnancy, assessment of gestational age, diagnosis of *malpresentations, ectopic pregnancies, and *hydatidiform moles, and detection of structural fetal abnormalities (see also transvaginal ultrasonography). It is also used to examine the abdominal organs, urinary tract, blood vessels, muscles, and tendons. More specialized techniques include *echocardiography, *transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), and endoscopic ultrasound examinations. See also Doppler ultrasound.

ultrasound (ultrasonic waves) n. sound waves of high frequency (above 20 kHz), inaudible to the human ear. Ultrasound in the range 2–20 MHz can be used to produce images of the interior of the human body as the waves reflect off structures back to the probe (see ultrasonography). Ultrasound waves have the advantage over X-rays of not being ionizing and are therefore much less harmful, particularly at energy levels used for diagnosis. The vibratory effect of ultrasound can also be used to break up stones in the body (see lithotripsy) and in the treatment of rheumatic conditions and cataract (see phacoemulsification). Ultrasonic instruments are used in dentistry to remove *calculus from the surfaces of teeth and to remove debris from the root canals of teeth in *root canal treatment. High-intensity focused ultrasound (see HIFU) can be used to destroy tissue, such as tumours. Keepsake ultrasound is the provision of ultrasound images of a fetus to the parents for nonmedical purposes; it is said by its proponents to help with bonding and to strengthen relationships in the family. See also endoscopic ultrasound.

ultrasound marker the appearance, on *ultrasonography of a pregnant woman, of a feature suggesting an abnormality in the fetus. Such markers can be classified as major fetal structural abnormalities or minor ultrasound features called soft markers. The latter are usually transient and may resolve spontaneously, but they may indicate the risk of a serious chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. An example is increased nuchal translucency (see nuchal translucency scanning).

ultraviolet rays invisible short-wavelength radiation beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum. Sunlight contains ultraviolet rays, which are responsible for the production of both suntan and – on overexposure – *sunburn. The dust and gases of the earth’s atmosphere absorb most of the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight (see ozone). If this did not happen, the intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun would be lethal to living organisms.

umbilical cord the strand of tissue connecting the fetus to the placenta. It contains two arteries that carry blood to the placenta and one vein that returns it to the fetus. It also contains remnants of the *allantois and *yolk sac and becomes ensheathed by the *amnion.

umbilical cord blood banked stem cells haemopoietic *stem cells collected from umbilical cord blood donated at birth, which can be stored indefinitely and used if a sibling or any other blood-compatible baby develops an illness (such as leukaemia) that could only be treated by cord-blood stem-cell transplantation. This facility is now available in the UK and the USA.

umbilical granuloma an overgrowth of tissue during the healing process of the umbilicus (belly button). It is a moist fleshy red lump of tissue seen in some babies in the first few weeks of life after the umbilical cord remnant has dried and fallen off. It can sometimes be seen in adults after navel piercings. If left untreated, the granuloma can take months to resolve.

umbilical hernia see exomphalos.

umbilicus (omphalus) n. the navel: a circular depression in the centre of the abdomen marking the site of attachment of the *umbilical cord in the fetus. —umbilical adj.

umbo n. a projecting centre of a round surface, especially the projection of the inner surface of the eardrum to which the malleus is attached.

uncertainty n. the situation in which no diagnostic conclusion can (yet) be reached but the patient remains ill. Professionals vary in their ability to cope with this uncertainty: the best clinical practice is to accept the lack of clarity, to continue to support the patient, and to use the situation creatively in his or her *best interest in the interim.

unciform bone see hamate bone.

uncinate fits a form of temporal lobe *epilepsy in which hallucinations of taste and smell and inappropriate chewing movements are prominent features.

unconjugated oestriol (uE3) a product of the placenta, levels of which are reduced in pregnancies affected by Down’s syndrome. It is one of the markers used in *prenatal screening tests (see triple test).

unconscious adj. 1. in a state of unconsciousness. 2. describing those mental processes of which a person is not aware. 3. (in psychoanalysis) denoting the part of the mind that includes memories, motives, and intentions that are not accessible to awareness and cannot be made conscious without overcoming resistances. In addition to the individual unconscious, Jung postulated the existence of a *collective unconscious. Compare subconscious.

unconsciousness n. a condition of being unaware of one’s surroundings, as in sleep, or of being unresponsive to stimulation. An unnatural state of unconsciousness may be caused by factors that produce reduced brain activity, such as lack of oxygen, *head injuries, poisoning, blood loss, and many diseases, or it may be brought about deliberately during general *anaesthesia. See also coma.

uncus n. any hook-shaped structure, especially a projection of the lower surface of the cerebral hemisphere that is composed of cortex belonging to the temporal lobe.

undecenoic acid an antifungal agent, applied to the skin for the treatment of athlete’s foot.

undine n. a small rounded container, usually made of glass, for solutions used to wash out the eye. It has a small neck for filling and a long tapering spout with a narrow outlet to deliver a fine stream of fluid to the eye.

undulant fever see brucellosis.

ungual adj. relating to the fingernails or toenails (ungues).

unguentum n. (in pharmacy) an ointment.

unguis n. a fingernail or toenail. See nail.

uni- combining form denoting one.

unicellular adj. describing organisms or tissues that consist of a single cell. Unicellular organisms include the protozoans, most bacteria, and some fungi.

unilateral adj. (in anatomy) relating to or affecting one side of the body or one side of an organ or other part.

union n. (in a fractured bone) the successful result of healing of a fracture, in which the previously separated bone ends have become firmly united by newly formed bone. Failure of union (non-union) may result if the bone ends are not immobilized or from infection or bone diseases. Compare malunion.

Union international contre le cancer see UICC.

unipolar adj. (in neurology) describing a neuron that has one main process extending from the cell body. Compare bipolar.

universal credit a welfare benefit in the UK that is due to replace six mean-tested benefits and tax credits, with the intention of simplifying the benefits system and strengthening incentives to work. Rollout of universal credit began in 2013 and is ongoing with a forecast completion date of 2022. It has been criticized by some for its focus on the centralization of administration, particularly the requirement for most claimants to file claims online rather than face-to-face, as well as for delays to the rollout, which was originally supposed to be complete in 2017.

unsaturated fatty acid a *fatty acid in which one (monounsaturated) or many (polyunsaturated) of the carbon atoms are linked by double bonds that are easily split in chemical reactions so that other substances can connect to them. These fats occur in fish and plant-derived foods, and a diet high in unsaturated fats is associated with low serum cholesterol levels. Compare saturated fatty acid.

uPM3 see PCA3.

UPPP n. see uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.

urachus n. the remains of the cavity of the *allantois, which usually disappears during embryonic development. In the adult it normally exists in the form of a solid fibrous cord connecting the bladder with the umbilicus, but it may persist abnormally as a patent duct. —urachal adj.

uracil n. one of the nitrogen-containing bases (see pyrimidine) occurring in the nucleic acid RNA.

uraemia n. the presence of excessive amounts of urea and other nitrogenous waste compounds in the blood. These waste products are normally excreted by the kidneys in urine; their accumulation in the blood occurs in kidney failure and results in nausea, vomiting, lethargy, drowsiness, and eventually (if untreated) death. Treatment may require dialysis or transplantation. —uraemic adj.

uran- (urano-) combining form denoting the palate.

urataemia n. the presence in the blood of sodium urate and other urates, formed by the reaction of uric acid with bases. In *gout, urataemia leads to deposition of urates in various parts of the body.

uraturia n. the presence in the urine of urates (salts of uric acid). Abnormally high concentrations of urates in urine occur in *gout.

urea n. the main breakdown product of protein metabolism. It is the chemical form in which unrequired nitrogen is excreted by the body in the urine. Urea is formed in the liver from ammonia and carbon dioxide in a series of enzyme-mediated reactions (the urea cycle). Accumulation of urea in the bloodstream together with other nitrogenous compounds is due to kidney failure and gives rise to *uraemia.

urease n. an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide.

urecchysis n. the escape of uric acid from the blood into spaces in the connective tissue.

ureter n. either of a pair of tubes, 25–30 cm long, that conduct urine from the pelvis of kidneys to the bladder. The walls of the ureters contain thick layers of smooth muscle, which contract to force urine into the bladder, between an outer fibrous coat and an inner mucous layer. —ureteral, ureteric adj.

ureter- (uretero-) combining form denoting the ureter(s). Example: ureterovaginal (relating to the ureters and vagina).

ureterectomy n. surgical removal of a ureter. This usually includes removal of the associated kidney as well (see nephroureterectomy). If previous nephrectomy has been performed to remove a kidney that has been destroyed by *vesicoureteric reflux or because of a tumour of the renal pelvis, subsequent ureterectomy may be necessary to cure reflux into the stump of the ureter or tumour in the ureter, respectively. Less commonly, in certain cases an isolated segment of a ureter may be removed for a short ureteric stricture or ureteric tumour.

ureteritis n. inflammation of the ureter. This usually occurs in association with inflammation of the bladder (see cystitis), particularly if caused by *vesicoureteric reflux. Tuberculosis of the urinary tract can also cause ureteritis, which progresses to *stricture formation.

ureterocele n. a cystic swelling of the wall of the ureter at the point where it passes into the bladder. It may be associated with stenosis of the opening of the ureter and it may cause impaired drainage of the kidney with dilatation of the ureter and *hydronephrosis. Ureteroceles may also be complicated by infection, prolapse, and bladder outflow obstruction.

ureteroenterostomy n. an artificial communication, surgically created, between the ureter and the bowel. In this form of urinary diversion, which bypasses the bladder, the ureters are attached to the sigmoid colon (see ureterosigmoidostomy).

ureterolithotomy n. the surgical removal of a stone from the ureter (see calculus). The operative approach depends upon the position of the stone within the ureter. If the stone occupies the lower portion of the ureter, it may be extracted by *cystoscopy, thus avoiding open surgery.

ureterolysis n. an operation to free one or both ureters from surrounding abnormal adhesions or fibrous tissue (e.g. retroperitoneal fibrosis). It may also be performed prior to pelvic surgery to avoid intraoperative ureteric injury.

ureteroneocystostomy n. the surgical reimplantation of a ureter into the bladder. This is most commonly performed to cure *vesicoureteric reflux. The ureter is reimplanted obliquely through the bladder wall to act as a valve and prevent subsequent reflux. The operation is usually referred to as an antireflux procedure or simply reimplantation of ureter.

ureteronephrectomy n. see nephroureterectomy.

ureteroplasty n. surgical reconstruction of the ureter using a segment of bowel or a tube of bladder (see Boari flap). This is necessary if a segment of ureter is damaged by disease or injury.

ureteropyelonephritis n. inflammation involving both the ureter and the renal pelvis (see ureteritis; pyelitis).

ureteroscope n. a rigid or flexible instrument that can be passed into the ureter and up into the pelvis of the kidney. It is most commonly used to visualize a stone in the ureter and remove it safely under direct vision with a stone basket or forceps. Larger stones need to be fragmented before removal with an ultrasound probe, lithoclast, or lasers. Ureteroscopy can also be used to visualize tumours in the ureter, and a flexible ureteroscope can be passed into the kidney to visualize and treat tumours or stones.

ureteroscopy n. the inspection of the lumen of the ureter with a *ureteroscope.

ureterosigmoidostomy n. the operation of implanting the ureters into the sigmoid colon (see ureteroenterostomy). This method of permanent urinary diversion may be used after *cystectomy or to bypass a diseased or damaged bladder. The urine is passed together with the faeces, and continence depends upon a normal anal sphincter. The main advantage of this form of diversion is the avoidance of an external opening and appliance to collect the urine; the disadvantages include possible kidney infection, acidosis, and long-term development of cancer of the colon 20–30 years after the procedure.

ureterostomy n. the surgical creation of an external opening from the ureter. This usually involves bringing the ureter to the skin surface through the abdominal wall so that the urine can drain into a suitable appliance (cutaneous ureterostomy). The divided dilated ureter can be brought through the skin to form a spout, but ureters of a normal size need to be implanted into a segment of bowel used for this purpose (see ileal conduit) to avoid narrowing and obstruction.

ureterotomy n. surgical incision into the ureter. The commonest reason for performing this is to allow removal of a stone (see ureterolithotomy).

urethr- (urethro-) combining form denoting the urethra.

urethra n. the tube that conducts urine from the bladder to the exterior. The female urethra is quite short (about 3.5 cm) and opens just within the *vulva, between the clitoris and vagina. The male urethra is longer (about 20 cm) and runs through the penis. As well as urine, it receives the secretions of the male accessory sex glands (prostate and Cowper’s glands and seminal vesicles) and spermatozoa from the *vas deferens; thus it also serves as the ejaculatory duct.

urethritis n. inflammation of the urethra. This may be due to gonorrhoea (specific urethritis), another sexually transmitted infection such as infection with *Chlamydia trachomatis (nongonococcal urethritis, NGU; or nonspecific urethritis, NSU), or to the presence of a catheter in the urethra. The symptoms are those of urethral discharge with painful or difficult urination (*dysuria). Treatment of urethritis due to infection is by administration of appropriate antibiotics after the causative organisms have been isolated from the discharge. Untreated or severe urethritis results in a urethral *stricture.

urethrocele n. prolapse of the urethra into the vaginal wall, which may be small and does not cause any symptoms or may cause a bulbous swelling to appear in the vagina, particularly on straining. The condition is associated with previous childbirth. Treatment is not required for small urethroceles, otherwise surgical repair of the lax tissues gives better support to the urethra and the vaginal wall.

urethrography n. a technique for X-ray examination of the urethra. *Contrast medium is introduced into the urethra so that its outline and any narrowing or other abnormalities may be observed in X-ray images (urethrograms). In ascending (or antegrade) urethrography contrast medium is injected up the urethra using a special syringe and penile clamp. In descending urethrography (or micturating cystourethrography, MCU), X-rays of the urethra can be taken during the passing of water-soluble contrast material previously instilled into the bladder in order to demonstrate abnormal urethral narrowing or disorders of micturition, particularly bladder emptying.

urethroplasty n. surgical repair of the urethra, especially a urethral *stricture. Anastomotic urethroplasty is used for a short stricture: the area of narrowing is excised and the two adjacent ends are then joined directly to each other. A substitution urethroplasty entails the insertion of a flap or patch of skin from the scrotum or a buccal mucosal graft into the urethra at the site of the stricture, which is laid widely open. The operation can be performed in one stage, although two stages are usual in the reconstruction of a posterior urethral stricture (see urethrostomy). Transpubic urethroplasty is performed to repair a ruptured posterior urethra following a fractured pelvis. Access to the damaged urethra is achieved by partial removal of the pubic bone.

urethrorrhaphy n. surgical restoration of the continuity of the urethra. This may be required following laceration of the urethra.

urethrorrhoea n. a discharge from the urethra. This is a symptom of *urethritis.

urethroscope n. an *endoscope, consisting of a fine tube fitted with a light and lenses, for examination of the interior of the male urethra, including the prostate region. —urethroscopy n.

urethrostenosis n. a *stricture of the urethra.

urethrostomy n. the operation of creating an opening of the urethra in the perineum in men. This can be permanent, to bypass a severe *stricture of the urethra in the penis, or it can form the first stage of an operation to cure a stricture of the posterior section of the urethra (*urethroplasty).

urethrotomy n. the operation of cutting a short *stricture in the urethra. It is performed under direct vision with a urethrotome. This instrument, a type of *endoscope, consists of a sheath down which is passed a fine knife, which is operated by the surgeon viewing the stricture down an illuminated telescope.

urge incontinence see incontinence.

urgency n. a *lower urinary tract symptom in which there is a compelling desire to pass urine immediately; this may or may not be associated with incontinence (urge incontinence).

urgent treatment centre see NHS walk-in centre.

-uria combining form denoting 1. a condition of urine or urination. Example: polyuria (passage of excess urine). 2. the presence of a specified substance in the urine. Example: haematuria (blood in).

uric acid a nitrogen-containing organic acid that is the end-product of nucleic acid metabolism and is a component of the urine. Crystals of uric acid are deposited in the joints of people suffering from *gout.

uricosuric drug a drug, such as *probenecid or *sulfinpyrazone, that increases the amount of *uric acid excreted in the urine.

uridine n. a compound containing uracil and the sugar ribose. See also nucleoside.

uridrosis n. the presence of excessive amounts of urea in the sweat; when the sweat dries, a white flaky deposit of urea may remain on the skin. The phenomenon occurs in *uraemia.

urin- (urino-, uro-) combining form denoting urine or the urinary system.

urinalysis n. the analysis of *urine, using physical, chemical, and microscopical tests, to determine the proportions of its normal constituents and to detect alcohol, drugs, sugar, blood, protein, or other abnormal constituents.

urinary bladder see bladder.

urinary diversion any of various techniques for the collection and diversion of urine away from its usual excretory channels, after the bladder has been removed (see cystectomy) or bypassed. These techniques include *ureterosigmoidostomy and the construction of an *ileal conduit. Continent diversion, usually after cystectomy, may be achieved by constructing a reservoir or pouch from a section of small or large intestine or a combination of both. This can be emptied by catheterization via a small *stoma and has the advantage over an ileal conduit in not requiring a urinary drainage bag.

urinary tract the entire system of ducts and channels that conduct urine from the kidneys to the exterior. It includes the ureters, the bladder, and the urethra.

urination (micturition) n. the periodic discharge of urine from the bladder through the urethra. It is initiated by voluntary relaxation of the sphincter muscle below the bladder and maintained by reflex contraction of the muscles of the bladder wall.

urine n. the fluid excreted by the kidneys, which contains many of the body’s waste products. It is the major route by which the end-products of nitrogen metabolism – *urea, *uric acid, and *creatinine – are excreted. The other major constituent is sodium chloride. Over 100 other substances are usually present, but only in trace amounts. Analysis of urine (see urinalysis) is commonly used in the diagnosis of diseases (for example, there are high levels of urinary glucose in diabetes and of ketone bodies in ketonuria); immunological analysis of urine is the basis of most *pregnancy tests. See Appendix 3.

urine output see vital signs.

uriniferous tubule see renal tubule.

urinogenital (urogenital) adj. of or relating to the organs and tissues concerned with both excretion and reproduction, which are anatomically closely associated.

urinogenital sinus the duct in the embryo that receives the ureter and the Wolffian and Müllerian ducts and opens to the exterior. The innermost portion forms most of the bladder and the remainder forms the urethra with its associated glands. Part of it may also contribute towards the vagina.

urinometer n. a hydrometer for measuring the specific gravity of urine.

urobilinogen n. a colourless product of the reduction of the *bile pigment bilirubin. Urobilinogen is formed from bilirubin in the intestine by bacterial action. Part of it is reabsorbed and returned to the liver; part of it is excreted in the faeces (a trace may also appear in the urine). When exposed to air, urobilinogen is oxidized to a brown pigment, urobilin.

urocele n. a cystic swelling in the scrotum, containing urine that has escaped from the urethra. This may arise following urethral injury. Immediate treatment is to divert the urine by suprapubic *cystotomy, local drainage of the swelling, and antibiotic administration.

urochesia n. the passage of urine through the rectum. This may follow a penetrating injury involving both the lower urinary tract and the bowel.

urodynamics n. the investigation of the function of the lower urinary tract. It involves the recording of pressures within the bladder during filling and voiding by the use of special equipment that can also record urethral sphincter pressures. Simultaneously, abdominal pressure is usually recorded with a catheter in the rectum, vagina, or ileal conduit. It is an essential investigation in the study of urinary incontinence. In some men, urodynamic studies are necessary to determine if their *lower urinary tract symptoms are caused by bladder outlet obstruction or *detrusor instability.

urofollitropin n. see human menopausal gonadotrophins.

urogenital adj. see urinogenital.

urogram n. an X-ray of the urinary tract or any part of it. It is usually obtained after the intravenous injection of a radiopaque substance, as in *intravenous urography, but the contrast medium can also be introduced percutaneously or, in the case of the bladder, transurethrally (for a cystogram; see cystography).

urography n. radiological examination of the urinary tract. This traditionally involves the injection of radiopaque contrast material and observation of the flow with X-rays (see cystography; intravenous urography; pyelography; urethrography). In CT urography contrast is injected in the vein and CT of the urinary tract acquired when the contrast arrives there. The technique is used in *haematuria to exclude the presence of a tumour within the renal pelvis, ureter, or bladder. MR urography is used to visualize the urinary tract by *magnetic resonance imaging. An MR contrast medium is injected into a peripheral vein and passes to the kidneys and ureters, when images of thin sections can be obtained. These can be manipulated by computer to reveal the anatomy and any pathology (e.g. stones, tumours) of the imaged structures. MR urography is particularly useful in children.

urokinase n. an enzyme produced in the kidney and also present in blood and urine that is capable of breaking up blood clots. It activates *plasminogen directly to plasmin, which dissolves blood clots (see plasminogen activators). Urokinase is administered to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

urolith n. a stone in the urinary tract. See calculus.

urology n. the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of diseases of the urinary tract. —urological adj. —urologist n.

uroporphyrin n. a porphyrin that plays an intermediate role in the synthesis of *protoporphyrin IX. It is excreted in significant amounts in the urine in porphyria.

ursodeoxycholic acid a drug (a *bile acid) used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones and to treat primary biliary cirrhosis. Side-effects are infrequent but include diarrhoea and indigestion.

urticaria (nettle rash, hives) n. an itchy rash resulting partly from the release of *histamine by *mast cells. This causes either short-lived itchy *weals, deeper swellings (angio-oedema), or both. Individual weals typically appear rapidly and resolve spontaneously within hours. Acute urticaria is common and represents an immediate response to such allergens as seafood or nuts; it has been linked with upper respiratory tract infections, although many cases remain unexplained. Chronic urticaria is not an allergic condition and may persist for years. Angio-oedema occurs when the weals involve the deeper levels of the skin, resulting in swelling of the lips, eyes, or tongue, which may constitute a medical emergency. Urticaria can be treated by taking antihistamines regularly, but sometimes immunosuppressant treatment is needed, especially in autoimmune subtypes. Cholinergic urticaria is a condition in which very small weals are brought on by heat, exercise, or emotion; treatment is with antihistamines, but other drugs, including danazol, may be used for severe cases.

usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) see interstitial pneumonia; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

uter- (utero-) combining form denoting the uterus. Examples: uterocervical (relating to the cervix (neck) of the uterus); uterovaginal (relating to the uterus and vagina); uterovesical (relating to the uterus and bladder).

uterine adj. of or relating to the uterus.

uterine artery embolization a method of embolizing the uterine artery under radiodiagnostic control (see embolization). It has been successful in controlling postpartum haemorrhage and can also be used in treating fibroids, correcting arterial or venous malformations of the genital tract, and terminating abdominal and cervical pregnancies.

uteroplacental insufficiency the most common cause of *intrauterine growth restriction, due to abnormalities in placental development and *trophoblast invasion. The exact cause may be unknown or due to a number of recognizable causes, e.g. pre-eclampsia, inherited *thrombophilias causing placental infarction or thrombosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may lead to stillbirth.

uterosacral suspension (vaginal vault suspension) suturing the uterosacral ligament (attaching the cervix to the sacrum) to the apex of the vagina, which is performed vaginally, laparoscopically, or abdominally to prevent or treat *vault prolapse following hysterectomy.

uterus (womb) n. the part of the female reproductive tract that is specialized to allow the embryo to become implanted in its inner wall and to nourish the growing fetus from the maternal blood. The nonpregnant uterus is a pear-shaped organ, about 7.5 cm long. It is suspended in the pelvic cavity by means of peritoneal folds (ligaments) and fibrous bands. The upper two-thirds of the uterus (body) is connected to the two *Fallopian tubes, and the narrower lower third (*cervix, or neck) projects at its lower end into the vagina. The uterus has an inner mucous lining (*endometrium) and a thick wall of smooth muscle (*myometrium). During childbirth the myometrium undergoes strong contractions to expel the fetus through the cervix and vagina. In the absence of pregnancy the endometrium undergoes periodic development and degeneration (see menstrual cycle). —uterine adj.

uterus didelphys (double uterus) a congenital condition resulting from the incomplete midline fusion of the two *Müllerian ducts during early embryonic development. The usual result is a double uterus with one or two cervices and a single vagina. Complete failure of fusion results in a double uterus with double cervices and two separate vaginae.

utilitarianism n. the consequentialist theory that maximizing utility (the greatest good or happiness or preferences of the greatest number) has priority over other ethical considerations. Developed in the 19th century by the British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, and thereafter influential in social planning, unadulterated utilitarian policies may threaten the rights (and duties) of individuals and therefore need to be balanced by considerations of *deontology. —utilitarian adj.

utilization behaviour the correct use of an object at an inappropriate time or in an inappropriate situation: such behaviour is indicative of frontal lobe lesions.

utricle (utriculus) n. 1. the larger of the two membranous sacs within the vestibule of the ear: it forms part of the membranous *labyrinth. It is filled with fluid (endolymph) and contains a *macula. This responds to gravity and relays information to the brain about the position of the head. 2. a small sac (the prostatic utricle) extending out of the urethra of the male into the substance of the prostate gland.

uvea (uveal tract) n. the vascular pigmented layer of the eye, which lies beneath the outer layer (sclera). It consists of the *choroid, *ciliary body, and *iris. —uveal adj.

uveal tract see uvea.

uveitis n. inflammation of any part of the uveal tract of the eye, either the iris (iritis), ciliary body (cyclitis), or choroid (choroiditis). Inflammation confined to the iris and ciliary body, which are commonly inflamed together, is called anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis (see also Fuchs’ heterochromic cyclitis); that confined to the choroid is termed posterior uveitis. In general, the causes of anterior and posterior uveitis are different; anterior uveitis (unlike choroiditis) is usually painful, with clusters of inflammatory cells (keratic precipitates) adhering to the inner surface of the cornea. All types may lead to visual impairment, and uveitis is an important cause of blindness. In most cases the disease appears to originate in the uveal tract itself, but it may occur secondarily to disease of other parts of the eye, particularly of the cornea and sclera.

Treatment consists of the use of drugs that suppress the inflammation, combined with measures to relieve the discomfort and more specific drug treatment if a specific cause of the uveitis is found. The drugs may be given as drops, injections, or tablets, often in combination.

uveoparotitis (uveoparotid fever) n. inflammation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid regions of the eye (the uvea) and swelling of the parotid salivary gland: one of the mani-festations of the chronic disease *sarcoidosis.

UVPP see uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.

uvula n. a small soft extension of the soft palate that hangs from the roof of the mouth above the root of the tongue. It is composed of muscle, connective tissue, and mucous membrane.

uvulectomy (staphylectomy) n. surgical removal of the uvula.

uvulitis n. inflammation of the uvula.

uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (uvulopharyngopalatoplasty, UPPP, uvulovelopharyngoplasty, UVPP) n. a surgical operation to remove the uvula, part of the soft palate, and the tonsils in the treatment of snoring and *obstructive sleep apnoea.





v


vaccination n. a means of producing immunity to a disease by using a *vaccine, or a special preparation of antigenic material, to stimulate the formation of appropriate antibodies. The name was applied originally only to treatment with vaccinia (cowpox) virus, which gives protection not only against cowpox itself but also against the related smallpox. However, it is now used synonymously with inoculation as a method of *immunization against any disease. Vaccination is often carried out in two or three stages, as separate doses are less likely to cause unpleasant side-effects. A vaccine is usually given by injection but may be introduced into the skin through light scratches; for some diseases (such as polio), oral vaccines are available.

vaccine n. a special preparation of antigenic material that can be used to stimulate the development of antibodies and thus confer active *immunity against a specific disease or number of diseases. Many vaccines are produced by culturing bacteria or viruses under conditions that lead to a loss of their virulence but not of their antigenic nature. Examples of live but attenuated (weakened) organisms in vaccines are those against measles, mumps, and rubella (the MMR vaccine) and tuberculosis. Other vaccines consist of specially treated toxins (*toxoids) or dead bacteria that are still antigenic. Precipitated toxoids are used against diphtheria and tetanus; dead organisms are used against cholera and typhoid. Extensive experimental study continues in the search for cancer vaccines, especially against melanoma and prostate cancer. See immunization.

vaccinia n. see cowpox.

vaccinoid adj. resembling a local infection with vaccinia (cowpox) virus. A vaccinoid reaction is one of the possible results of vaccination against smallpox in individuals who already have partial immunity. The swelling, reddening, and blistering are considerably less than the so-called primary reaction that occurs after the inoculation of a person with no immunity against smallpox.

vacuole n. a space within the cytoplasm of a cell, formed by infolding of the cell membrane, that contains material taken in by the cell. White blood cells form vacuoles when they surround and digest bacteria and other foreign material.

vacuum aspiration the removal by suction of the products of conception to terminate a pregnancy or evacuate the uterus following miscarriage. Carried out under local anaesthetic up to the 12th week of pregnancy, it uses a hand-held syringe (manual vacuum aspiration, MVA) or an electric pump (electric vacuum aspiration, EVA) to create suction.

vacuum extractor see ventouse.

VAD see ventricular assist device.

vagin- (vagino-) combining form denoting the vagina.

vagina n. the lower part of the female reproductive tract: a muscular tube, lined with mucous membrane, connecting the cervix of the uterus to the exterior. It receives the erect penis during coitus: semen is ejaculated into the upper part of the vagina and from there the sperms must pass through the cervix and uterus in order to fertilize an ovum in the Fallopian tube. The wall of the vagina is sufficiently elastic to allow the passage of the newborn child. —vaginal adj.

vaginal adenosis the presence of glandular tissue in or under the vaginal epithelium that undergoes squamous *metaplasia. It may be associated with intrauterine *diethylstilbestrol exposure. See also clear-cell carcinoma.

vaginal agenesis congenital absence of part or all of the vagina. See Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome.

vaginectomy n. surgical excision of the vagina in cases of vaginal cancer.

vaginismus n. painful spasm of the muscles surrounding the vagina, usually in response to the *vulva or vagina being touched. Sexual intercourse may be impossible, and the condition may be associated with fear of or aversion to coitus. Other causative factors include vaginal infection and atrophic *vaginitis.

vaginitis n. inflammation of the vagina, which may be caused by infection (most commonly with *Trichomonas vaginalis), dietary deficiency, or poor hygiene. There is often itching (see pruritus), increased vaginal discharge, and pain on passing urine. Vaginitis may indicate the presence of sexually transmitted disease. Atrophic vaginitis is postmenopausal thinning of the vagina caused by a reduction in the circulating levels of oestrogens. It is a common cause of vaginal dryness and postmenopausal bleeding.

vaginoplasty (colpoplasty) n. 1. a tissue-grafting operation on the vagina. 2. surgical reconstruction of the vagina, for example by using a loop of bowel brought through the *pouch of Douglas.

vaginosis n. see bacterial vaginosis.

vago- combining form denoting the vagus nerve.

vagotomy n. the surgical cutting of any of the branches of the vagus nerve. This is usually performed to reduce secretion of acid and pepsin by the stomach in order to treat a peptic ulcer. Truncal vagotomy is the cutting of the main trunks of the vagus nerve; in selective vagotomy the branches of the nerve to the gall bladder and pancreas are left intact. Highly selective (or proximal) vagotomy is the cutting of the branches of the vagus nerve to the body of the stomach, leaving the branches to the outlet (pylorus) intact: this makes additional surgery to permit emptying of the stomach contents unnecessary. Following surgery, patients may experience postvagotomy diarrhoea after a meal (compare dumping syndrome). Since the introduction of proton-pump inhibitors for the treatment of peptic-ulcer disease, these operations are rarely performed.

vagus nerve the tenth *cranial nerve (X), which supplies motor nerve fibres to the muscles of swallowing and parasympathetic fibres to the heart and organs of the chest cavity and abdomen. Sensory branches of the vagus carry impulses from the viscera and the sensation of taste from the mouth.

VAIN (vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia) preinvasive disease of the vagina, which has histological features and terminology similar to those of *cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

valaciclovir n. an antiviral drug taken by mouth to treat *herpes infections. Like aciclovir, it is a *DNA polymerase inhibitor. Trade name: Valtrex.

valgus adj. describing any deformity that displaces the distal end of a limb away from the midline. See club-foot; hallux valgus; knock-knee. Compare varus.

validity n. an indication of the extent to which a measure (e.g. a clinical sign or test) is a true indicator of what it purports to measure (e.g. disease). Reduced validity can arise if the test produces different results when conducted several times on the same person under identical conditions (i.e. reduced reproducibility, reliability, or repeatability). This may be because the same observer gets different results on successive occasions (intraobserver error) or because a series of different observers fail to obtain the same result (interobserver error). Such errors may arise because of a true difference in observation and/or interpretation or because of a preconceived notion (often unconscious) by the observer, which influences his or her behaviour.

valine n. an *essential amino acid. See also amino acid.

vallecula n. a furrow or depression in an organ or other part. On the undersurface of the cerebellum a vallecula separates the two hemispheres.

valproic acid see sodium valproate.

Valsalva manoeuvre an attempt by a person to exhale forcibly with a closed glottis while pinching the nose and keeping the mouth closed, so that no air exits through the mouth or nose, as when straining during a bowel movement or lifting a heavy weight. The resulting increased pressure transplants air through the Eustachian tube, thus equalizing the negative pressure in the middle ear. This manoeuvre can often relieve the ear pain associated with flying, which is usually associated with changes in pressure particularly occurring during takeoff and landing. [A. M. Valsalva (1666–1723), Italian anatomist]

valsartan n. see angiotensin II antagonist.

value judgment a judgment of the worth, desirability, acceptability, or merit of something, as distinct from a claim about fact or neutral description.

values pl. n. (in ethics) the moral standards and principles that govern personal and institutional behaviour. They derive from asking first what makes a good clinician or caring institution and then identifying the attributes, behaviours, actions, and aims appropriate to this end. They include concepts such as truthfulness, kindness, tolerance, and *integrity.

valve n. a structure found in some tubular organs or parts that restricts the flow of fluid within them to one direction only. Valves are important structures in the heart, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Such a valve consists of two or three *cusps fastened like pockets to the walls of the vessel. Blood flowing in the right direction flattens the cusps to the walls, but when flow is reversed the cusps become filled with blood or lymph and dilate to block the opening (see illustration). See also aortic valve; mitral valve; pulmonary valve; tricuspid valve.

Valve. (A) Cut vein showing the two cusps of a valve; (B) action of a venous valve.





valvoplasty n. see valvuloplasty.

valvotomy (valvulotomy) n. surgical cutting through a valve. The term is usually used to describe an operation to relieve obstruction caused by stenosed valves in the heart (see valvuloplasty).

valvula n. (pl. valvulae) a small valve. The valvulae conniventes are circular folds of mucous membrane in the small intestine.

valvulitis n. inflammation of one or more valves, particularly the heart valves. This may be acute or chronic and is most often due to rheumatic fever (see endocarditis).

valvuloplasty (valvoplasty) n. therapeutic dilatation of a narrowed heart valve. This used to be done by open heart surgery, but is now performed using balloon catheters threaded into the heart via the venous or arterial system (balloon valvuloplasty). It is most commonly used for treatment of *mitral stenosis (using an Inoue balloon) or pulmonary stenosis, and sometimes used as a temporary measure for severe aortic stenosis.

vancomycin n. an antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces orientalis, that is effective against most Gram-positive organisms (e.g. streptococci and staphylococci). Used for treating serious infections (including endocarditis and *MRSA) due to strains that are resistant to other antibiotics, it usually has a low toxicity but may cause deafness and blood disorders. Vancomycin and teicoplanin (a related drug with similar uses) are known as glycopeptide antibiotics.

van den Bergh’s test a test to determine whether excess bilirubin in the blood is conjugated or unconjugated, and therefore whether jaundice in a patient is due to *haemolysis or to disease of the liver or bile duct. A sample of serum is mixed with sulphanilic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite. The immediate appearance of a violet colour is called a direct reaction and indicates that the jaundice is due to liver damage or obstruction of the bile duct. If the colour appears only when alcohol is added, this is an indirect reaction and points to haemolytic jaundice or a congenital unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (see Gilbert’s syndrome). [A. A. H. van den Bergh (1869–1943), Dutch physician]

vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) a metabolite of *catecholamines excreted in abnormal amounts in the urine in conditions of excess catecholamine production, such as *phaeochromocytoma. The measurement of VMA levels in a 24-hour urine sample was formerly used as a screening test for this condition, but in the UK it has been largely superseded by the urinary metanephrine test (see metanephrine and normetanephrine).

vaporizer n. a piece of equipment for producing an extremely fine mist of liquid droplets by forcing a jet of liquid through a narrow nozzle with a jet of air. Vaporizers are used to produce aerosols of various medications for use in inhalation therapy.

Vaquez–Osler disease see polycythaemia vera. [L. H. Vaquez (1860–1936), French physician; Sir W. Osler (1849–1919), Canadian physician]

vardenafil n. see sildenafil.

variable n. (in statistics) any characteristic (e.g. age, lifestyle, or habit) relating to an individual or group that can take a number of different values. Categorical or qualitative variables are descriptive characteristics, such as sex, race, or occupation; quantitative variables relate to a numerical scale and are subdivided into discrete variables, found only at fixed points (e.g. number of children), and continuous variables, found at any point on a scale (e.g. weight). See also confounding; correlation.

variable positive airways pressure see BiPAP.

variance n. see standard deviation.

variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) see Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

varicectomy n. see phlebectomy.

varicella n. see chickenpox.

varices pl. n. see varicose veins.

varicocele n. a collection of dilated veins in the spermatic cord. Approximately 90%, affect the left side rather than the right. It usually produces no symptoms apart from occasional aching discomfort. In some cases varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy or a poor sperm count (see oligospermia) sufficient to cause infertility. Surgical correction or radiological embolization of the varicocele in such patients (varicocelectomy) usually results in a considerable improvement in the quality and motility of the sperm, but may or may not improve the number of pregnancies and live births thereafter. A renal cancer should be excluded in men presenting with a left-sided varicocele.

varicose veins veins that are distended, lengthened, and tortuous. The superficial veins (saphenous veins) of the legs are most commonly affected; other sites include the oesophagus (see oesophageal varices) and testes (*varicocele). There is an inherited tendency to varicose veins but obstruction to blood flow is responsible in some cases. Complications including thrombosis, *phlebitis, and haemorrhage may occur. Treatment includes elastic support and *sclerotherapy, but *avulsion (stripping), excision (*phlebectomy), or *endovenous laser treatment is required in some cases. Medical name: varices.

varicotomy n. incision into a varicose vein (see phlebectomy).

varifocal lenses (progressive lenses) lenses in which the power (see dioptre) gradually changes from one prescription to the other and there is no dividing line on the lens between the different segments (compare multifocal lenses). The wearer can see clearly at any distance by raising or lowering the eyes.

variola n. see smallpox.

varioloid 1. n. a mild form of smallpox in people who have previously had smallpox or have been vaccinated against it. 2. adj. resembling smallpox.

varix n. (pl. varices) a single *varicose vein.

varus adj. describing any deformity that displaces the distal end of a limb towards the midline. See bow-legs; club-foot; hallux varus. Compare valgus.

vas n. (pl. vasa) a vessel or duct.

vas- (vaso-) combining form denoting 1. vessels, especially blood vessels. 2. the vas deferens.

vasa efferentia (sing. vas efferens) the many small tubes that conduct spermatozoa from the testis to the epididymis. They are derived from some of the excretory tubules of the *mesonephros.

vasa praevia an uncommon but potentially disastrous complication of delivery, occurring in about 1 in 5000 deliveries, when unprotected fetal vessels run across the *lower uterine segment and cervix in front of the presenting part of the fetus. It is associated with a velamentous insertion of the cord (where the umbilical cord inserts directly into the membranes rather than the placenta) and in cases with normal cord insertion when the vessels run between the two lobes of a bilobed placenta. Vessels unsupported by placental tissue or the umbilical cord can tear when the cervix dilates or the membranes rupture, causing rapid fetal haemorrhage. Immediate Caesarean section to save the baby from *exsanguination is indicated. Fetal mortality for cases not recognized before the onset of labour is very high; appropriate use of prenatal ultrasonography may prevent perinatal death.

vasa vasorum pl. n. the tiny arteries and veins that supply the walls of blood vessels.

vascular adj. relating to or supplied with blood vessels.

vascular dementia see dementia.

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a *growth factor made by both normal cells and their abnormal or malignant counterparts to stimulate new blood vessel formation (see angiogenesis). It can be targeted by a family of drugs known as *angiogenesis inhibitors, which include *bevacizumab.

vascularization n. the development of blood vessels (usually capillaries) within a tissue.

vascular system see cardiovascular system.

vasculitis (angiitis) n. (pl. vasculitides) a patchy inflammation of the walls of blood vessels that leads to damage and thrombosis. It can occur on its own (primary vasculitis) or in association with other conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis. All the organs in the body can be affected but common symptoms include skin rashes, arthritis, headaches, breathlessness, and kidney failure. Treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs may be beneficial.

vasculogenesis n. the formation of new blood vessels resulting from the directed migration and differentiation of angioblasts (precursor cells) into endothelial cells. The primitive vessels undergo further growth and remodelling by *angiogenesis. Although largely confined to the embryo, vasculogenesis has recently been shown to occur in adults from circulating angioblasts.

vas deferens (pl. vasa deferentia) either of a pair of ducts that conduct spermatozoa from the *epididymis to the *urethra on ejaculation. It has a thick muscular wall the contraction of which assists in ejaculation.

vasectomy n. the surgical operation of severing the duct (vas deferens) connecting the testis to the seminal vesicle and urethra. Vasectomy of both ducts results in sterility and is an increasingly popular means of birth control. Vasectomy does not affect sexual desire or potency.

vaso- combining form. see vas-.

vasoactive adj. affecting the diameter of blood vessels, especially arteries. Examples of vasoactive agents are emotion, pressure, carbon dioxide, and temperature. Some exert their effect directly, others via the *vasomotor centre in the brain.

vasoactive intestinal peptide see VIP.

vasoconstriction n. a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels, especially arteries. This results from circulating vasoconstrictor hormones (e.g. *angiotensin I) or activation of the *vasomotor centre in the brain, which bring about contraction of the muscular walls of the arteries and hence an increase in blood pressure.

vasoconstrictor n. an agent that causes narrowing of the blood vessels and therefore a decrease in blood flow. Vasoconstrictor drugs are alpha agonists (see sympathomimetic): they are used to raise the blood pressure in disorders of the circulation, shock, or severe bleeding and to maintain blood pressure during surgery (e.g. *ephedrine, *metaraminol, *phenylephrine). Some vasoconstrictors (e.g. ephedrine, *xylometazoline) have a rapid effect when applied to mucous membranes and may be used to relieve nasal congestion. If the blood pressure rises too quickly headache and vomiting may occur. A vasoconstrictor is often added to local anaesthetic solutions used in dentistry to prolong their effectiveness.

vasodilatation n. an increase in the diameter of blood vessels, especially arteries. This results from local vasodilator hormones (e.g. *prostaglandins) or activation of the *vasomotor centre in the brain, which bring about relaxation of the arterial walls and a consequent lowering of blood pressure.

vasodilator n. a drug that causes widening of the blood vessels and therefore an increase in blood flow. Vasodilators are used to lower blood pressure in cases of hypertension. Coronary vasodilators, such as *glyceryl trinitrate, increase the blood flow through the heart and are used to relieve and prevent angina. Large doses of coronary vasodilators cause such side-effects as flushing of the face, severe headache, and fainting. Peripheral vasodilators affect blood flow to the limbs; they include *alpha blockers and some *calcium-channel blockers. Certain of the latter (e.g. *nifedipine) are used to treat conditions due to poor circulation, such as Raynaud’s disease and intermittent claudication.

vaso-epididymostomy n. the operation of joining the vas deferens to the epididymis in a side-to-side manner in order to bypass an obstruction to the passage of sperm from the testis. The obstruction, which may be congenital or acquired, is usually present in the mid-portion or tail of the epididymis. Vaso-epididymostomy is therefore usually performed by anastomosing the head of the epididymis to a longitudinal incision in the lumen of the adjacent vas.

vasography n. X-ray imaging of the *vas deferens. A contrast medium is injected either into the exposed vas deferens at surgery, using a fine needle, or into the ejaculatory duct (which discharges semen from the vesicle into the vas deferens) by inserting a catheter via an endoscope. The technique is used in the investigation of *azoospermia, to look for blockages in the vas.

vasoligation n. the surgical tying of the vas deferens (the duct conveying sperm from the testis). This is performed to prevent infection spreading from the urinary tract and causing recurrent *epididymitis. It is sometimes performed at the same time as *prostatectomy to prevent the complication of epididymitis in the postoperative period.

vasomotion n. an increase or decrease in the diameter of blood vessels, particularly the arteries. See vasoconstriction; vasodilatation.

vasomotor adj. controlling the muscular walls of blood vessels, especially arteries, and therefore their diameter.

vasomotor centre a collection of nerve cells in the medulla oblongata that receives information from sensory receptors in the circulatory system (see baroreceptor) and brings about reflex changes in the rate of the heartbeat and in the diameter of blood vessels, so that the blood pressure can be adjusted. The vasomotor centre also receives impulses from elsewhere in the brain, so that emotion (such as fear) may also influence the heart rate and blood pressure. The centre works through *vasomotor nerves of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

vasomotor nerve any nerve, usually belonging to the autonomic nervous system, that controls the circulation of blood through blood vessels by its action on the muscle fibres within their walls or its action on the heartbeat. The *vagus nerve slows the heart and reduces its output, but sympathetic nerves increase the rate and output of the heart and increase blood pressure by causing the constriction of small blood vessels at the same time.

vasomotor symptoms subjective sensations experienced by women around the time of the *menopause, often described as explosions of heat (hot flushes), mostly followed by profuse sweating and sometimes preceded by an undetermined sensation with waking at night. Objective signs are sudden reddening of the skin on the head, neck, and chest and profuse sweating. Physiological changes include peripheral vasodilatation, *tachycardia with normal blood pressure, and raised skin temperature with normal body temperature.

vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) n. a hormone, released by the pituitary gland, that increases the reabsorption of water by the kidney, thus preventing excessive loss of water from the body. Vasopressin also causes constriction of blood vessels. Synthetic vasopressin is administered to treat *diabetes insipidus and to control bleeding from *oesophageal varices by restricting arterial blood flow to the liver.

vasopressor adj. stimulating the contraction of blood vessels and therefore bringing about an increase in blood pressure.

vasospasm n. see Raynaud’s disease.

vasotomy n. a surgical incision into the vas deferens (the duct conveying sperm from the testis). This is usually undertaken to allow catheterization of the vas and the injection of radiopaque contrast material for X-ray examination (see vasography), to test for patency of the duct in patients with *azoospermia.

vasovagal adj. relating to the action of impulses in the *vagus nerve on the circulation. The vagus reduces the rate at which the heart beats, and so lowers its output.

vasovagal attack excessive activity of the vagus nerve, causing slowing of the heart and a fall in blood pressure, which leads to fainting. See syncope.

vasovasostomy n. the surgical operation of reanastomosing the vas deferens after previous vasectomy: the reversal of vasectomy, undertaken to restore fertility. It is ideally performed using microsurgical techniques. The success rates vary depending on the time between the vasectomy and its reversal.

vasovesiculitis n. inflammation of the *seminal vesicles and *vas deferens. This usually occurs in association with *prostatitis and causes pain in the perineum, groin, and scrotum and a high temperature. On examination the vasa and seminal vesicles are thickened and tender. Treatment includes administration of antibiotics.

vastus n. any of three muscles (vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis) that form part of the *quadriceps muscle of the thigh.

vault prolapse prolapse of the *fornix (vault) of the vagina, which occurs at the time of hysterectomy (vaginal or abdominal) when the superior vaginal support mechanism is disrupted. It can be surgically corrected (see sacrocolpopexy; uterosacral suspension).

VCE see video capsule endoscopy.

vCJD see Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

vectis n. a small hollow instrument used to introduce fluid into the anterior chamber of the eye in order to raise its pressure to aid cataract extraction.

vector n. 1. an animal, usually an insect or a tick, that transmits parasitic microorganisms – and therefore the diseases they cause – from person to person or from infected animals to human beings. Mosquitoes, for example, are vectors of malaria, filariasis, and yellow fever. 2. an agent used to insert a foreign gene or DNA fragment into a bacterial or other cell in *genetic engineering and *gene therapy. Viruses, especially retroviruses, are often used as vectors: once inside the host cell, the virus can replicate and thus produce copies (*clones) of the gene.

vegetation n. (in pathology) an abnormal outgrowth from a membrane, fancied to resemble a vegetable growth. In ulcerative endocarditis, such outgrowths, consisting of *fibrin with enmeshed blood cells, are found on the membrane lining the heart valves.

vegetative adj. 1. relating to growth and nutrition rather than to reproduction. 2. functioning unconsciously; autonomic.

vegetative state the clinical condition of unawareness of the self or the environment. The patient breathes spontaneously and has a stable circulation and sleep/wake cycles. It results from extensive damage to the cerebral cortex and thalamus while the brainstem and hypothalamus remain intact. The commonest causes are traumatic brain injury (e.g. road-traffic accidents) and cardiopulmonary arrest. Conditions that mimic the vegetative state include the psychiatric state of *catatonia and the locked-in syndrome, resulting from damage to the brainstem, in which the patient is conscious but unable to speak or make any movements of the body except for blinking and upward eye movements. See also persistent vegetative state.

VEGF see vascular endothelial growth factor.

vehicle n. (in pharmacy) any substance that acts as the medium in which a drug is administered. Examples are sterile water, isotonic sodium chloride, and dextrose solutions.

veil of ignorance a hypothetical state, advanced by the US political philosopher John Rawls, in which decisions about social justice and the allocation of resources would be made fairly, as if by a person who must decide on society’s rules and economic structures without knowing what position he or she will occupy in that society. By removing knowledge of status, abilities, and interests, Rawls argued, one could eliminate the usual effects of egotism and personal circumstances on such decisions. Rawls maintained that any society designed on this basis would adhere to two principles: the principle of equal liberty, which gives each person the right to as much freedom as is compatible with the freedom of others, and the maximin principle, which allocates resources so that the benefit of the least advantaged people is maximized as far as possible. Rawls’s exposition, and the maximin principle in particular, have proved widely influential in discussions of welfare provision and, especially, the allocation of medical resources.

vein n. a blood vessel conveying blood towards the heart. All veins except the *pulmonary vein carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues, via the capillaries, to the vena cava (see illustration overleaf). The walls of veins consist of three tissue layers, but these are much thinner and less elastic than those of arteries. Veins contain *valves that assist the flow of blood back to the heart. Anatomical name: vena. —venous adj.

A vein (transverse section).





velamen (velamentum) n. a covering membrane.

Velcade n. see bortezomib.

vellus n. the fine hair that occurs on the body before puberty is reached.

velum n. (in anatomy) a veil-like covering. The medullary velum is either of two thin layers of tissue that form part of the roof of the fourth ventricle of the brain.

VEMP see vestibular evoked myogenic potential test.

vena n. (pl. venae) see vein.

vena cava (pl. venae cavae) either of the two main veins, conveying deoxygenated blood from the other veins to the right atrium of the heart. The inferior vena cava, formed by the union of the right and left common iliac veins, receives blood from parts of the body below the diaphragm. The superior vena cava, originating at the junction of the two innominate veins, drains blood from the head, neck, thorax, and arms.

vene- (veno-) combining form denoting veins.

veneer n. a facing of *composite resin or *porcelain applied to the surface of a tooth to give improved shape and/or colour. The tooth usually requires minimal preparation and the facing is retained by enamel that has been treated by the *acid-etch technique. Veneers are a more conservative way of treating discoloured teeth than by *crowns.

venene n. a mixture of two or more *venoms: used to produce antiserum against venoms (antivenene).

venepuncture (venipuncture) n. the puncture of a vein for any therapeutic purpose; for example, to extract blood for laboratory tests. See also phlebotomy.

venesection n. see phlebotomy.

venlafaxine n. see SNRI.

veno- combining form. see vene-.

venoclysis n. the continuous infusion into a vein of saline or other solution.

venography (phlebography) n. imaging of the veins. Traditionally a *radiopaque contrast medium is injected into a vein and X-ray photographs (venograms) taken as the medium flows towards the heart. Damage, obstruction, or abnormal communication with other vessels can be demonstrated. It can be done during a CT or MRI evaluation. A common usage is in demonstrating deep vein *thrombosis in the legs. Increasingly ultrasound is being used, both with colour Doppler (see Doppler ultrasound) and *compression venography. See also angiography.

venom n. the poisonous material produced by snakes, scorpions, spiders, and other animals for injecting into their prey or enemies. Some venoms produce no more than local pain and swelling; others produce more general effects and can prove lethal.

venoplasty n. balloon dilatation of a narrowed vein, similar to *angioplasty.

venosclerosis n. see phlebosclerosis.

venous thromboembolism (VTE) the formation of a blood clot in a vein, which may become detached and lodged elsewhere. It includes deep vein thrombosis (see phlebothrombosis) and *pulmonary embolism. VTE is a leading direct cause of maternal death (see maternal mortality rate). See also thromboembolism.

ventilation n. 1. the passage of air into and out of the respiratory tract. The air that reaches only as far as the conducting airways cannot take part in gas exchange and is known as dead space ventilation – this may be reduced by performing a *tracheostomy. In the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) gas exchange is most efficient when matched by adequate blood flow (*perfusion). Ventilation/perfusion imbalance (ventilation of underperfused alveoli or perfusion of underventilated alveoli) is an important cause of *anoxia and *cyanosis. 2. the use of a *ventilator to maintain or support the breathing movements of patients. Invasive ventilation involves the insertion of an endotracheal tube (see intubation), through which air is blown into the lungs; patients need to be paralysed and anaesthetized. This need can be eliminated by using techniques of *noninvasive ventilation.

The principal veins of the body.





ventilation-perfusion scanning (V/Q scanning) a nuclear medicine technique in which two different isotopes are used, one inhaled (usually *xenon-133 or *krypton-81m), to examine lung ventilation, and the other injected into a vein, to examine lung perfusion. In *pulmonary embolism, the area of lung supplied by the blocked artery is not being perfused with blood – which gives a perfusion defect on the film – but has normal ventilation. This technique is highly sensitive for pulmonary embolism.

ventilator n. 1. a device to ensure a supply of fresh air. 2. (respirator) equipment that is manually or mechanically operated to maintain a flow of air into and out of the lungs of a patient who is unable to breathe normally. Positive-pressure ventilators blow air into the patient’s lungs; air is released from the lungs when the pressure from the ventilator is relaxed (see BiPAP; Nippy; noninvasive ventilation). Negative-pressure ventilators are airtight containers in which the air pressure is decreased and increased mechanically. This draws air into and out of the patient’s lungs through the normal air passages. The original devices, known colloquially as iron lungs, had a seal around the neck and enclosed the whole body except the head. They have been replaced by cuirass ventilators, which work on a similar principle but enclose the chest only; there may be a role for these in adults and children with claustrophobia.

ventouse (vacuum extractor) n. a device to assist delivery consisting of a suction cup that is attached to the head of the fetus: traction is then applied slowly. Introduced in 1954, it is widely used and has now virtually replaced rotational obstetric forceps.

ventral adj. relating to or situated at or close to the front of the body or to the anterior part of an organ.

ventricle n. 1. either of the two lower chambers of the *heart, which have thick muscular walls. The left ventricle, which is thicker than the right, receives blood from the pulmonary vein via the left atrium and pumps it into the aorta. The right ventricle pumps blood received from the venae cavae (via the right atrium) into the pulmonary artery. 2. one of the four fluid-filled cavities within the brain (see illustration). The paired first and second ventricles (lateral ventricles), one in each cerebral hemisphere, communicate with the third ventricle in the midline between them. This in turn leads through a narrow channel, the cerebral aqueduct, to the fourth ventricle in the hindbrain, which is continuous with the spinal canal in the centre of the spinal cord. *Cerebrospinal fluid circulates through all the cavities. —ventricular adj.

Ventricles of the brain (side view).





ventricul- (ventriculo-) combining form denoting a ventricle (of the brain or heart).

ventricular assist device (VAD) a mechanical pump implanted in the body for the purpose of taking over some or all of the pumping action of the heart in patients with severe heart damage. Support may be given to the left ventricle (LVAD), right ventricle (RVAD), or both. Most such devices require *thoracotomy, but a percutaneous device is now also available. This is usually regarded as a temporary measure until the heart has recovered or is transplanted.

ventricular fibrillation (VF) see fibrillation.

ventricular folds see vocal folds.

ventricular septal defect (VSD) a defect of the heart, usually congenital but occasionally acquired due to damage following *myocardial infarction, in which there is a hole in the partition (septum) separating the two ventricles (see septal defect). In 25% of patients there are other defects present. 50% of VSDs close spontaneously. If the hole is large, blood is diverted to the lungs at a greater pressure than usual and *pulmonary hypertension can occur, which becomes irreversible and progressive (*Eisenmenger reaction). Early surgical intervention can prevent this.

ventricular tachycardia (VT) a dangerously fast beating of the heart stemming from an abnormal focus of electrical activity in the *ventricles. The electricity does not pass through the heart along the usual channels and as a result the contraction of the heart muscle is often not as efficient as normal, which can result in a sudden drop in blood pressure or even *cardiac arrest. Left untreated it will prove ultimately fatal. See also arrhythmia; torsades de pointes.

ventriculitis n. inflammation in the ventricles of the brain, usually caused by infection. It may result from the rupture of a cerebral abscess into the cavity of the ventricle or from the spread of a severe form of *meningitis from the subarachnoid space.

vernier n. a device for obtaining accurate measurements of length, to 1/10th, 1/100th or smaller fractions of a unit. It consists of a fixed graduated main scale against which a shorter vernier scale slides. The vernier scale is graduated into divisions equal to nine-tenths of the smallest unit marked on the main scale. The vernier scale is often adjusted by means of a screw thread. A reading is taken by observing which of the markings on the scales coincide.

Each vertebra typically consists of a body, or centrum, from the back of which arises an arch of bone (the vertebral or neural arch) enclosing a cavity (the vertebral canal, or foramen) through which the spinal cord passes. The vertebral arch bears one spinous process and two transverse processes, providing anchorage for muscles, and four articular processes, with which adjacent vertebrae articulate (see illustration). Individual vertebrae are bound together by ligaments and *intervertebral discs. —vertebral adj.

Vertebra. A typical thoracic vertebra (from above).

vertigo n. a disabling sensation in which affected individuals feel that either they themselves or their surroundings are in a state of constant movement. It is most often a spinning sensation but there may be a feeling that the ground is tilting. It is a symptom of disease either in the *labyrinth of the inner ear or in the *vestibular nerve or its nuclei in the brainstem, which are involved in the sense of balance. See also benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) a *lipoprotein that is the precursor of *low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Containing triglycerides and cholesterol, it is produced in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream, where its triglycerides are hydrolysed to free fatty acids by *lipoprotein lipase. The remaining lipoprotein becomes progressively denser and richer in cholesterol to form LDL.

vesical adj. relating to or affecting an anatomical bladder, especially the urinary bladder.

vesicant n. an agent that causes blistering of the skin.

vesicostomy n. the surgical creation of an artificial channel between the bladder and the skin surface for the passage of urine. It is sometimes combined with closure of the urethra.

vesicoureteric reflux the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters. It is classified into primary or congenital vesicoureteric reflux, which is due to defective valves (which normally prevent reflux), or secondary, which is due to another condition (e.g. *neuropathic bladder). Infection may be conveyed to the kidneys, causing recurrent attacks of acute *pyelonephritis and scarring of the kidneys in childhood. Children with urinary infection must be investigated for reflux by *cystoscopy; if the condition does not settle with antibiotic therapy corrective surgery must be performed.

vesicovaginal fistula an abnormal communication between the bladder and the vagina (see fistula) causing urinary incontinence. This may result from surgical damage to the bladder during a gynaecological operation (e.g. hysterectomy) or radiation damage following radiotherapy for pelvic malignancy. In developing countries it is often caused by necrosis associated with prolonged obstructed labour.

vesicular breathing see breath sounds.

vesiculectomy n. surgical removal of a *seminal vesicle. This operation, which is rarely undertaken, may be performed for chronic infection, unusual cases of infertility, and rarely for a tumour of the seminal vesicles.

vesiculitis n. inflammation of the seminal vesicles. See vasovesiculitis.

vesiculography n. any technique for imaging the seminal vesicles. This used to be performed by injecting a contrast medium into the vas deferens during *vasography. More commonly direct injection is now performed during *transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), enabling sperm to be sampled at the same examination. Injected contrast medium or dye should be seen draining into the vas deferens to the bladder if there is no blockage. *Magnetic resonance imaging is a good technique for imaging the seminal vesicles with no radiation exposure. Both these techniques are useful for investigation of patients with *azoospermia.

vessel n. a tube conveying a body fluid, especially a blood vessel or a lymphatic vessel.

vestibular apparatus those parts of the inner ear involved with balance. They comprise the *semicircular canals, *saccule and *utricle. See ear; vestibular system.

vestibular schwannoma a slow-growing benign tumour arising on one of the *vestibular nerves. It is also known as an acoustic neuroma, but this is a misnomer as the tumour arises from *Schwann cells rather than nerve cells and on a vestibular nerve rather than the cochlear (acoustic) nerve. Symptoms include hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance and there is an increased prevalence of the tumour in patients who have *neurofibromatosis type II. Diagnosis is by MRI scan and treatment is not always required. In those cases where treatment is necessary, this may be by surgery, radiotherapy, or *gamma knife.

vestibular system those parts of the body involved in balance. The peripheral vestibular system, or *vestibular apparatus, is in the inner ear. The central vestibular system comprises those parts of the brain that are involved in balance. The central vestibular system receives other inputs as well as from the ear, in particular inputs from the eyes and proprioceptors.

vestigial adj. existing only in a rudimentary form. The term is applied to organs whose structure and function have diminished during the course of evolution until only a rudimentary structure exists.

VF ventricular *fibrillation.

viable adj. capable of living a separate existence. The legal age of viability of a fetus is 24 weeks, by virtue of the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended), but some fetuses now survive birth at an even earlier gestational age due to advances in neonatal medicine and technologies. The treatment of very premature neonates can raise issues of *personhood, *quality of life, and resource allocation. —viability n.

viable myocardium see hibernating myocardium.

Viagra n. see sildenafil.

vibrissa n. (pl. vibrissae) a stiff coarse hair, especially one of the stiff hairs that lie just inside the nostrils.

vicarious adj. describing an action or function performed by an organ not normally involved in the function. For example, vicarious menstruation is a rare disorder in which monthly bleeding occurs from places other than the vagina, such as the sweat glands, breasts, nose, or eyes.

video- combining form denoting the use of a video camera to view and record moving images. See videofluoroscopy.

video capsule endoscopy (VCE) an investigation for visualizing the intestinal lining (mucosa). A capsule containing a miniature digital video camera is swallowed by the patient and passively propelled through the intestine by peristalsis. The images are uploaded to a computer for subsequent analysis. Various capsules are available for investigation of oesophageal, small-intestinal, and colonic disorders. The commonest in use is the small-intestinal capsule, for investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent iron-deficiency anaemia, or in cases of suspected Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, or small-bowel tumours.

villus n. (pl. villi) one of many short finger-like processes that project from some membranous surfaces. Numerous intestinal villi line the small *intestine. Each contains a network of blood capillaries and a *lacteal. Their function is to absorb the products of digestion and they greatly increase the surface area over which this can take place. Chorionic villi are folds of the *chorion (the outer membrane surrounding a fetus) from which the fetal part of the *placenta is formed. They provide an extensive area for the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste products between maternal and fetal blood. See also arachnoid villus; chorionic villus sampling.

It has numerous actions, including vasodilatation of blood vessels in the gut, reduction of acid secretion by the stomach, and enhanced secretion of electrolytes into the small bowel.

VIPoma n. a usually malignant tumour of islet cells of the pancreas that secretes large amounts of *VIP. This results in severe watery diarrhoea (‘pancreatic cholera’ or the Verner–Morrison syndrome), with loss of potassium and bicarbonate and a low level of stomach acid. The treatment is surgical removal of the tumour.

viraemia n. the presence in the blood of virus particles.

viral pneumonia an acute infection of the lung caused by any one of a number of viruses, such as *respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and enteroviruses. It is characterized by headache, fever, muscle pain, and a cough that produces a thick sputum. The pneumonia can often occur with or subsequent to a systemic viral infection. Treatment is by supportive care, but antibiotics are administered if a bacterial infection is superimposed.

Virchow–Robin spaces (perivascular spaces) fluid-filled spaces that form around blood vessels in the *pia mater as they penetrate deeper brain tissue. They may dilate, resulting in raised intracranial pressure. [R. Virchow (1821–1902), German pathologist]

Virchow’s node an enlarged lymph node that may be palpated above the left clavicle (the left supraclavicular fossa). It is strongly associated with abdominal malignancy, particularly cancer of the stomach, since the lymphatic drainage from the abdomen is channelled via the thoracic duct to the left side of the neck before it enters the left subclavian vein. Enlargement of the right supraclavicular lymph node is associated with lung and oesophageal cancer.

virilism n. the development in a female of male secondary sexual characteristics, such as increased body hair, muscle bulk, and deepening of the voice.

virilization n. the most extreme result of excessive androgen production (*hyperandrogenism) in women.

virulence n. the disease-producing (pathogenic) ability of a microorganism. See also attenuation.

virus n. a minute particle that is capable of replication but only within living cells. Viruses are too small to be visible with a light microscope and too small to be trapped by filters. They infect animals, plants, and microorganisms (see bacteriophage). Each consists of a core of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein shell. Some bear an outer lipid capsule. Viruses cause many diseases, including the common cold, influenza, measles, mumps, chickenpox, herpes, AIDS, polio, and rabies. *Antiviral drugs are effective against some of them, and many viral diseases are controlled by means of vaccines. —viral adj.

viscoelastic material a material exhibiting both viscous and elastic properties. It is used in ophthalmic surgery to help maintain the shape of ocular tissues as well as lubricate and minimize trauma. It is commonly used in intraocular surgery, such as cataract surgery. Viscoelastic materials are also used in dentistry for impression and filling materials.

viscus n. see viscera.

visual acuity sharpness of vision: the degree to which a person is able to distinguish and resolve fine detail. The essential requirements are a healthy retina and the ability of the eye to focus incoming light to form a sharp image on the retina. Acuity of distant vision is often expressed as a Snellen score (see Snellen chart) or a LogMAR score (see LogMAR chart); acuity of near vision as a Jaeger score (see Jaeger test types).

visual field the area in front of the eye in any part of which an object can be seen without moving the eye. With both eyes open and looking straight forward it is possible to see well-illuminated objects placed anywhere in front of the eyes, although the eyebrows and eyelids reduce the extent of the field somewhat. This is the binocular visual field. With only one eye open the field is uniocular and is restricted inwards by the nose. If the object is small or poorly illuminated it will not be seen until it is moved closer to the point at which the eye is actually looking, i.e. nearer to the centre of the visual field. Similarly, coloured objects are not seen so far away from the centre as are white objects of the same size and brightness. This is because the retina is not uniformly sensitive to light of different colours or intensities (see rod; cone): retinal sensitivity increases towards its centre (the *macula). Thus, while there is an absolute visual field beyond which things cannot be seen, no matter how large or bright they are, a relative field exists for objects of different brightness, size, and colour. The most common visual field loss is due to *glaucoma. See also perimeter.

visual pathway see optic nerve.

visual purple see rhodopsin.

visual reinforcement audiometry (visual reinforced audiometry, VRA) a behavioural test of hearing for children aged approximately 6 to 30 months in which the subject sits between two calibrated loudspeakers. A sound is generated from one loudspeaker. Children who turn towards the sound are rewarded by brief illumination of a toy adjacent to the loudspeaker. Older children can be tested with headphones, rather than using the loudspeakers, to enable each ear to be tested separately. The test can be adapted for use with older subjects who have learning disabilities.

vital capacity the maximum volume of air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation. It is usually measured on an instrument called a spirometer.

vital centre any of the collections of nerve cells in the brain that act as governing centres for different vital body functions – such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature control etc. – making reflex adjustments according to the body’s needs. Most lie in the hypothalamus and brainstem.

Vitallium n. trade name for an alloy of chromium and cobalt that is used in instruments, prostheses, surgical appliances, and dentures.

vital signs signs that a patient is alive, on which are based a commonly performed set of measurements used internationally as a general baseline in medicine and surgery. These include measurements of *body temperature (T), *blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR; see pulse), and *respiratory rate (RR) and can also include assessment of consciousness using the *Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and of urine output (UO, in millilitres per hour).

vital staining (intravital staining) the process of staining a living tissue by injecting a stain into the organism. Compare supravital staining.

vital statistics see biostatistics.

vitamin n. any of a group of substances that are required, in very small amounts, for healthy growth and development: they cannot be synthesized by the body and are therefore essential constituents of the diet. Vitamins are divided into two groups, according to whether they are soluble in water or fat. The water-soluble group includes the vitamin B complex and vitamin C; the fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K. Lack of sufficient quantities of any of the vitamins in the diet results in specific vitamin deficiency diseases.

vitamin A (retinol) a fat-soluble vitamin that occurs preformed in foods of animal origin (especially milk products, egg yolk, and liver) and is formed in the body from the pigment β-*carotene, present in some vegetable foods (for example green leafy vegetables and carrots). Retinol is essential for growth, vision in dim light, and the maintenance of soft mucous tissue. A deficiency causes stunted growth, *night blindness, *xerophthalmia, *keratomalacia, and eventual blindness. The adult RNI for retinol (see Dietary Reference Values) is 600 μg/day for women and 700 μg/day for men. Lactating women need an additional 350 μg/day. A retinol equivalent (6 μg β-carotene) is nutritionally equivalent to 1 μg retinol.

vitamin B any one of a group of water-soluble vitamins that, although not chemically related, are often found together in the same kinds of food (milk, liver, cereals, etc.) and all function as *coenzymes. See vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, biotin; folate; nicotinic acid; pantothenic acid.

vitamin B1 (thiamine, aneurine) a vitamin of the B complex that is active in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate, a coenzyme in decarboxylation reactions in carbohydrate metabolism. A deficiency of vitamin B1 leads to *beriberi. Good sources of the vitamin are cereals, beans, meat, potatoes, and nuts. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 0.4 mg/1000 kcal of dietary calories eaten.

vitamin B2 (riboflavin) a vitamin of the B complex that is a constituent of the coenzymes *FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide) and *FMN (flavine mononucleotide). Riboflavin is therefore important in tissue respiration; it is also required to aid the absorption of iron. A deficiency of riboflavin causes a condition known as *ariboflavinosis, which is not usually serious. Good sources of riboflavin are liver, milk, and eggs. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 1.3–1.6 mg/day.

vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) a vitamin of the B complex from which the coenzyme *pyridoxal phosphate, involved in the transamination of amino acids, is formed. The vitamin is found in most foods and a deficiency is therefore rare. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 15 μg/g dietary protein.

vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) a vitamin of the B complex. The form of vitamin B12 with coenzyme activity is 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, which is necessary for the synthesis of nucleic acids, the maintenance of *myelin in the nervous system, and the proper functioning of *folate, another B vitamin. The vitamin can be absorbed only in the presence of intrinsic factor, a protein secreted in the stomach. A deficiency of vitamin B12 affects nearly all the body tissues, particularly those containing rapidly dividing cells. The most serious effects of a deficiency are *pernicious anaemia and degeneration of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 is manufactured only by certain microorganisms and is contained only in foods of animal origin. Good sources are liver, fish, and eggs. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 1.5 μg/day. Vegans can be at risk of deficiency.

vitamin C (ascorbic acid) a water-soluble vitamin with *antioxidant properties that is essential in maintaining healthy connective tissues and the integrity of cell walls. It is necessary for the synthesis of collagen. A deficiency of vitamin C leads to *scurvy. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 30 mg/day; rich sources are citrus fruits and vegetables (the main source of the vitamin in the British diet is potatoes). There is no strong evidence that high intakes of vitamin C reduce the incidence of colds.

vitamin D a fat-soluble vitamin that enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestine and promotes their deposition in the bone. It occurs in two forms: ergocalciferol (vitamin D2, calciferol), which is manufactured by plants when the sterol ergosterol is exposed to ultraviolet light, and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), which is produced by the action of sunlight on 7-dehydrocholesterol, a sterol widely distributed in the skin. A deficiency of vitamin D, either from a poor diet or lack of sunlight, leads to decalcified bones and the development of *rickets and *osteomalacia. Good sources of vitamin D are liver and fish oils. An RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) was set for the first time in 2015, at 10 ug/d for all individuals over 4 years of age. Research continues into a possible association between vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D is toxic and large doses must therefore be avoided.

vitamin E any of a group of chemically related fat-soluble compounds (tocopherols and tocotrienols) that have *antioxidant properties and are thought to stabilize cell membranes by preventing oxidation of their unsaturated fatty acid components. The most potent of these is α-tocopherol. Good sources of the vitamin are vegetable oils, eggs, margarine, and wholemeal cereals. It is fairly widely distributed in the diet and a deficiency is therefore unlikely. There is no set recommendation for dietary intake.

vitamin K a fat-soluble vitamin occurring in two main forms: phytomenadione (of plant origin) and menaquinone (synthesized by bacteria in the large intestine; deficiency is rare). It is necessary for the formation of *prothrombin in the liver, which is essential for blood clotting, and it also regulates the synthesis of other clotting factors. Good dietary sources are green leafy vegetables and meat. Large changes in the dietary intake of vitamin K should be avoided by people taking *warfarin.

vitelliform degeneration (Best’s disease) degeneration of the *macula of the eye that is inherited as a dominant characteristic and usually starts in childhood. There is widespread abnormality of retinal pigment epithelium (see retina) with the accumulation of a yellowish material, especially in the macular area.

vitellus n. the yolk of an ovum.

vitiligo n. a common disorder in which symmetrical white or pale *macules appear on the skin. The face and extremities (including the genitalia) are commonly affected. It is more conspicuous in darker skin types. Vitiligo is an *autoimmune disease and may occur with other such diseases (e.g. thyroid disease or *alopecia areata). It is usually progressive, although spontaneous repigmentation may occur. Treatment with potent topical corticosteroids, topical *calcineurin inhibitors, or phototherapy may be effective. Cosmetic camouflage may be necessary if treatments are unsuccessful.

vitrectomy n. the removal of the whole or part of the vitreous humour of the eye. Anterior vitrectomy is removal of the front portion of the vitreous humour. Vitrectomy is often required to remove a nonresolving vitreous haemorrhage and also as a part of surgical procedures on the retina, including repair of a detached retina.

vitreous detachment the separation of the *vitreous humour from the underlying retina. This is a normal ageing process, but it is also more common in such conditions as diabetes and severe myopia. It can sometimes cause a tear in the retina and lead to *retinal detachment.

vitreous humour (vitreous body) the transparent jelly-like material that fills the chamber behind the lens of the eye.

vitrification n. a process in which eggs or embryos in vitro are preserved by being dehydrated, treated with an antifreeze chemical, and then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. They instantly become converted into a glassy material without the formation of ice crystals, which can damage the genetic material, seen with slower forms of freezing.

vitritis n. inflammation within the vitreous humour of the eye.

viviparous adj. describing animal groups (including most mammals) in which the embryos develop within the body of the mother so that the young are born alive rather than hatch from an egg. —viviparity n.

vivisection n. a surgical operation on a living animal for experimental purposes.

VMA see vanillylmandelic acid.

vocal folds (vocal cords) the two folds of tissue which protrude from the sides of the *larynx to form a narrow slit (glottis) across the air passage (see illustration). Their controlled interference with the expiratory air flow produces audible vibrations that make up speech, song, and all other vocal noises. Alterations in the vocal folds themselves or in their nerve supply by disease interfere with phonation.

The vocal folds.





vocal fremitus see fremitus.

vocal resonance the sounds heard through the stethoscope when the patient speaks (“ninety nine”). These are normally just audible but become much louder (bronchophony) if the lung under the stethoscope is consolidated, when they resemble the sounds heard over the trachea and main bronchi. Vocal resonance is lost over pleural fluid except at its upper surface, when it has a bleating quality and is called aegophony. See also pectoriloquy.

vocational training see foundation training.

volar adj. relating to the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot (the vola).

Volkmann’s contracture fibrosis and shortening of muscles due to inadequate blood supply, which may arise from arterial injuries or *compartment syndrome. Sites most commonly involved are the forearm, hand, leg, and foot and the condition may result in clawing of the fingers or toes. It may be a complication of fractures, vascular surgery, or using a tight bandage or plaster cast. [R. von Volkmann (1830–89), German surgeon]

volsellum (vulsellum) n. surgical forceps with clawlike hooks at the ends of both blades.

volt n. the *SI unit of electric potential, equal to the potential difference between two points on a conducting wire through which a constant current of 1 ampere flows when the power dissipated between these points is 1 watt. Symbol: V.

voluntary admission (informal admission) entry of a patient into a psychiatric hospital with his (or her) agreement. Compare compulsory admission.

voluntary hospital in the USA, a hospital that is owned or operated by a religious organization or community association to provide health-care facilities on a non-profit basis. In recent decades the role of voluntary hospitals has changed from one of caring primarily for *charity patients to one of serving all members of a community. At the same time, the practice of charging higher fees to patients able to afford them in order to compensate for the expense of caring for charity patients has generally been eliminated.

voluntary muscle see striated muscle.

volvulus n. twisting of a part of the digestive tract, usually leading to partial or complete obstruction and often reducing the blood supply, causing gangrene. A volvulus may untwist spontaneously or by manipulation, but surgical exploration is usually performed. Gastric volvulus is a twist of the stomach, usually in a hiatus *hernia. Small-intestinal volvulus is twisting of part of the bowel around an *adhesion. Sigmoid volvulus is a twist of the sigmoid colon, usually when this part of the colon is particularly long. Compound volvulus (or ileosigmoid knotting) involves both the small and the large bowel.

vomer n. a thin plate of bone that forms part of the nasal septum (see nasal cavity). See also skull.

vomica n. 1. an abnormal cavity in an organ, usually a lung, sometimes containing pus. 2. the abrupt expulsion from the mouth of a large quantity of pus or decaying matter originating in the throat or lungs.

vomit 1. vb. to expel the contents of the stomach through the mouth (see vomiting). 2. n. the contents of the stomach ejected during vomiting. Medical name: vomitus.

vomiting n. the reflex action of expelling the contents of the stomach through the mouth. Vomiting is controlled by a special centre in the brain that may be stimulated by certain drugs or by nerve signalling from the stomach (e.g. after ingesting toxic substances or in stomach diseases, such as peptic ulceration or pyloric stenosis), the intestine (e.g. in intestinal obstruction), or from the inner ear (in motion sickness). The stimulated vomiting centre sets off a chain of nerve impulses producing coordinated contractions of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles and relaxation of the sphincter between the gullet and the stomach, leading to the forcible ejection of stomach contents. Medical name: emesis.

von Hippel–Lindau disease an inherited syndrome in which *haemangioblastomas, particularly in the cerebellum, are associated with renal and pancreatic cysts, *angiomas in the retina (causing blindness), cancer of the kidney cells, and red birthmarks. [E. von Hippel (1867–1939), German ophthalmologist; A. Lindau (1892–1958), Swedish pathologist]

von Recklinghausen’s disease 1. a syndrome due to excessive secretion of *parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism), characterized by loss of mineral from bones, which become weakened and fracture easily, and formation of kidney stones. Medical name: osteitis fibrosa. 2. see neurofibromatosis. [F. D. von Recklinghausen (1833–1910), German pathologist]

Von Rosen’s sign see Barlow manoeuvre. [S. Von Rosen, Swedish orthopaedic surgeon]

von Willebrand’s disease an inherited disorder of the blood that is characterized by episodes of spontaneous bleeding similar to *haemophilia. It is due to a variety of abnormalities of the von Willebrand factor, a glycoprotein necessary for *platelet activation. This results in a bleeding tendency. The most common type of von Willebrand’s disease is inherited as an autosomal *dominant trait; some types are inherited as autosomal *recessive traits. [A. von Willebrand (1870–1949), Swedish physician]

voxel n. short for ‘volume element’, the volume of tissue in a body that is represented by a *pixel in a cross-sectional image. It depends on the slice thickness of the original scan.

vPAP (variable positive airways pressure) trade name for a brand of ventilator that delivers air to the lungs at different levels of pressure. See BiPAP.

VRA see visual reinforcement audiometry.

VSD see ventricular septal defect.

VT see ventricular tachycardia.

VTE see venous thromboembolism.

VT storm multiple episodes of *ventricular tachycardia (VT) over a period of hours. Treatment can be difficult, particularly as this condition is often triggered as a side-effect of antiarrhythmic medication (see proarrhythmia).

vulnerability n. a position of relative disadvantage, which requires a person to trust and depend upon others. In a medical context, all patients are vulnerable to an extent and some may be particularly so owing to impaired decision-making abilities or social position. Any *exploitation of a vulnerable person is considered contrary to medical ethics. There is increasing interest in the vulnerabilities of health-care professionals themselves and the evidence for *compassion fatigue, *burnout, and *ethical erosion is strong. A number of commentators have argued that the most effective therapeutic relationships occur when both the patient and clinician are aware of their own humanity because they have each experienced being vulnerable. A number of specific services and support groups have been established to help doctors and other health-care professionals in difficulty (see Schwartz rounds). —vulnerable adj.

vulsellum n. see volsellum.

vulv- (vulvo-) combining form denoting the vulva.

vulva n. the female external genitalia. Two pairs of fleshy folds – the labia majora and labia minora – surround the openings of the vagina and urethra and extend forward to the clitoris (see illustration). See also vestibular glands. —vulval adj.

The vulva.





vulval cancer a relatively rare gynaecological cancer, most common in the elderly. The most common symptom is longstanding itch, but vulval pain, discharge, and bleeding have also been reported. Surgery is the primary treatment, with wide excision by radical *vulvectomy and regional *lymphadenectomy. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be used.

vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) premalignant disease of the vulva, which has histological features and terminology similar to those of *cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Viral aetiological factors, such as HPV, are thought to be involved. The most common presenting symptom is itch, but VIN may be asymptomatic and detected only during treatment of preinvasive or invasive lesions of the cervix or lower genital tract.

vulval vestibulitis pain on entry or touch of the vulva, with redness of the *vestibular glands, tenderness on pressure, and dyspareunia. The pain, which is localized, is described as a severe burning sensation; itching is not usually a feature (compare vulvitis). The condition seems to be more common in premenopausal Caucasian women with a history of anxiety and related disorders. See also vulvodynia.

vulvectomy n. surgical removal of the external genitals (see vulva) of a woman. Simple vulvectomy involves excision of the labia majora, labia minora, and clitoris and is carried out for a nonmalignant growth. Radical vulvectomy is a much more extensive operation carried out for a malignant growth, e.g. cancer of the vulva. It involves wide excision of the labia majora and minora and the clitoris in addition to complete removal of all regional lymph nodes on both sides. The skin covering these areas is also removed, leaving an extensive raw area that is allowed to heal by *granulation.

vulvitis n. inflammation of the vulva, which is often accompanied by intense itching (see pruritus).

vulvodynia n. unexplained vulval pain, often coupled with sexual dysfunction and psychological disorder, which is often described by the patient as a burning stinging sensation and/or rawness. Cyclic vulvodynia occurs in relation to menstruation or coitus and is thought to be due to changes in vaginal pH that make the vulva more susceptible to infection. Essential (or dysaesthetic) vulvodynia is thought to be due to an altered perception of cutaneous pain, like postherpetic *neuralgia. Treatment of essential vulvodynia is with tricyclic antidepressants at night, biofeedback, vestibulectomy, cognitive behavioural therapy, topical capsaicin cream, lignocaine gel, and good skin care.

vulvovaginitis n. inflammation of the vulva and vagina (see pruritus; vaginitis).





w


Waardenburg’s syndrome an inherited form of deafness accompanied by a characteristic white forelock of hair and multiple colours within the irises of the eyes. It is inherited as an autosomal *dominant disease, i.e. the children of an affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder, although severity is variable. The gene responsible has been identified. [P. J. Waardenburg (1886–1979), Dutch ophthalmologist]

wafer n. a thin sheet made from moistened flour, formerly used to enclose a powdered medicine that is taken by mouth.

WAGR syndrome Wilms’ tumour (see nephroblastoma), aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation: a condition due to a deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 11.

waist to hip ratio (WHR) the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. It is used as a measure of obesity and is a more reliable predictor of obesity-related mortality than *body mass index alone.

waiter’s-tip deformity see Erb’s palsy.

waiting list a list of the patients awaiting admission to hospital after having been assessed either as an out-patient or on a *domiciliary consultation involving a specialist. In general the patients are offered places in the order in which their names were placed on the list, but in certain circumstances (e.g. if the condition is potentially dangerous or painful) the consultant may recommend urgent or even immediate admission. One of the variables recorded in relation to hospital admissions is the length of time between the name being placed on the list and the patient being admitted (waiting time). General practitioners may also request direct admission (immediate) for urgent cases who have not been seen by the consultant; such admission may be arranged by phone with the consultant or his or her deputy, or via the accident and emergency department of the hospital.

Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) a type of low-grade relatively slow-growing non-Hodgkin’s *lymphoma characterized by enlarged lymph nodes and high levels of abnormal IgM (*macroglobulin) in the blood (see macroglobulinaemia). [J. G. Waldenstrom (1906–96), Swedish physician]

walking distance the measured distance that a patient can walk before he or she is stopped by pain in the muscles, usually the calf muscles, or breathlessness. It is a useful estimate of the degree of impairment of the blood supply. See claudication.

Wallerian degeneration degeneration of a ruptured nerve fibre that occurs within the nerve sheath distal to the point of severance. [A. V. Waller (1816–70), British physician]

warfarin n. an *anticoagulant used mainly in the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent embolism in other patients at risk. The principal toxic effect is local bleeding, usually from the gums and other mucous membranes, and the drug should be avoided during pregnancy. Warfarin has also been used as a rat poison.

wart n. a benign growth on the skin caused by infection with *human papillomavirus (a few of the many serotypes are *oncogenic). Common warts are firm horny papules, 1–10 mm in diameter, found mainly on the hands. Most will clear spontaneously within two years. Plantar warts (or verrucae) occur on the soles and are often tender. Plane warts are flat and skin-coloured – and therefore difficult to see; they are usually found on the face and may be present in very large numbers. Anogenital warts are frequently associated with other genital infections (see condyloma). Treatment of warts is with OTC (over-the-counter) remedies, such as lactic and salicylic acids; *cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is also effective. Curettage and cautery is very occasionally used, as well as immunotherapy with diphencyclopropenone.

Warthin’s tumour (adenolymphoma) a tumour of the parotid salivary glands, containing epithelial and lymphoid tissues with cystic spaces. [A. S. Warthin (1866–1931), US pathologist]

Wassermann reaction formerly, the most commonly used test for the diagnosis of *syphilis. A sample of the patient’s blood is examined, using a *complement-fixation reaction, for the presence of antibodies to the organism Treponema pallidum. A positive reaction (WR+) indicates the presence of antibodies and therefore infection with syphilis. [A. P. von Wassermann (1866–1925), German bacteriologist]

water bed a bed with a flexible water-containing mattress. The surface of the bed adapts itself to the patient’s posture, which leads to greater comfort and fewer pressure sores.

waterbrash n. sudden filling of the mouth with dilute saliva – this often accompanies dyspepsia, particularly if there is nausea – or with acid or bitter fluid in patients with *heartburn.

water-deprivation test a test for *diabetes insipidus in which fluid and food intake is withheld completely for up to 24 hours, with regular measurement of plasma and urinary *osmolality and body weight. Normally (and in a person with psychogenic *polydipsia) the output of *vasopressin will be increased in order to concentrate the urine as the plasma osmolality rises; correspondingly, the urine osmolality also rises and its volume diminishes. In a patient with diabetes insipidus, however, the urine osmolality will remain low and of high volume while the patient steadily dehydrates. The test must be abandoned if the patient loses 3% of body weight.

Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome acute haemorrhage in the adrenal glands with haemorrhage into the skin associated with the sudden onset of acute bacteraemic *shock. It is usually caused by meningococcal septicaemia (see meningitis). [R. Waterhouse (1873–1958), British physician; C. Friderichsen (20th century), Danish physician]

weber n. the *SI unit of magnetic flux, equal to the flux linking a circuit of one turn that produces an e.m.f. of 1 volt when reduced uniformly to zero in 1 second. Symbol: Wb.

Weber’s test a hearing test in which a vibrating tuning fork is placed at the midpoint of the forehead. A normal individual hears it equally in both ears, but if one ear is affected by conductive *deafness the sound appears louder in the affected ear. If one ear has a sensorineural deafness the sound appears louder in the unaffected ear. [F. E. Weber (1832–91), German otologist]

web space the soft tissue between the bases of the fingers and toes.

Wechsler scales standardized scales for the measurement of *intelligence quotient (IQ) in adults and children. They are administered by a psychologist. See intelligence test. [D. Wechsler (1896–1981), US psychologist]

Wegener’s granulomatosis see granulomatosis with polyangiitis. [F. Wegener (1907–90), German pathologist]

Weigart–Meyer rule the relationship of the upper and lower parts of a two-part kidney with two ureters and their drainage into the bladder. It states that the upper ureter inserts lower and more medially into the bladder in contrast to the lower ureter, which inserts higher and more laterally into the bladder. [C. Weigert (1845–1904), German pathologist; R. Meyer (1864–1947), German physician]

Weil–Felix reaction a diagnostic test for typhus. A sample of the patient’s serum is tested for the presence of antibodies against the organism Proteus vulgaris. Although this relatively harmless organism is not the cause of typhus, it possesses certain antigens in common with the causative agent of the disease and can therefore be used instead of it in laboratory tests. Typhus is suspected if antibodies are found to be present. [E. Weil (1880–1922), German physician; A. Felix (1887–1956), Czech bacteriologist]

Weil’s disease see leptospirosis. [A. Weil (1848–1916), German physician]

Weiss ring a ringlike opacity on the posterior vitreous surface, arising as a result of a posterior *vitreous detachment. It is seen as a ring-shaped *floater.

Welch’s bacillus see Clostridium. [W. H. Welch (1850–1934), US pathologist]

Werdnig–Hoffmann disease a hereditary disorder – a severe form of *spinal muscular atrophy – in which the cells of the spinal cord begin to die between birth and the age of six months, causing a symmetrical muscle weakness. Affected infants become floppy and progressively weaker; respiratory and facial muscles become affected. Children usually die by the age of 20 months from respiratory failure and there is no treatment. *Genetic counselling is required for parents of an affected child as each of their subsequent children has a one in four chance of being affected. [G. Werdnig (1844–1919), Austrian neurologist; J. Hoffmann (1857–1919), German neurologist]

Wermer’s syndrome see MENS. [P. Wermer, US physician]

Werner’s syndrome a rare genetic disorder resulting in premature ageing that starts at adolescence. Growth may be retarded and affected individuals may suffer from a thin skin, arterial disease, leg ulcers, and diabetes. Treatment is limited to the management of complications, such as diabetes. The gene responsible codes for an enzyme involved in the mechanisms of DNA replication and repair, which in affected individuals is defective. [C. W. O. Werner (1879–1936), German physician]

Wernicke’s encephalopathy mental confusion or delirium occurring in combination with paralysis of the eye muscles, *nystagmus, and an unsteady gait. It is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) and is most commonly seen in alcoholics and in patients with persistent vomiting or an unbalanced diet. Treatment with thiamine relieves the symptoms. [K. Wernicke (1848–1905), German neurologist]

West Nile fever a viral disease caused by the West Nile virus (a *flavivirus), which is spread by the Culex pipiens mosquito. It causes encephalitis, with influenza-like symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes, and a bright red rash on the chest and abdomen. In patients with a weakened immune system (such as the elderly) it can progress to convulsions, coma, and paralysis.

wet-and-dry bulb hygrometer see hygrometer.

Wharton’s duct the secretory duct of the submandibular *salivary gland. [T. Wharton (1614–73), English physician]

Wharton’s jelly the mesoderm tissue of the umbilical cord, which becomes converted to a loose jelly-like *mesenchyme surrounding the umbilical blood vessels.

wheeze n. an abnormal high-pitched (sibilant) or low-pitched sound heard – either by the unaided human ear or through the stethoscope – mainly during expiration. Wheezes occur as a result of narrowing of the airways, such as results from *bronchospasm or increased secretion and retention of sputum; they are commonly heard in patients with asthma or chronic bronchitis.

whiplash injury a soft-tissue injury of the neck resulting from a sudden jerking back (hyperextension) of the head and neck, usually following a rear-end motor vehicle collision. It is associated with muscle, tendon, and ligament tears and inflammation in the front of the neck, which causes pain and stiffness. The possibility of fractures and other serious spinal injuries should be excluded by X-ray or MRI. Treatment includes analgesics, NSAIDs, a soft surgical collar, and physiotherapy. Symptoms occasionally last for many months or years.

Whipple’s disease a rare disease, occurring commonly (but not exclusively) in males, in which absorption of digested food in the intestine is reduced. As well as symptoms and signs of *malabsorption there is usually abdominal pain, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. Diagnosis is usually made by small-intestinal biopsy (duodenal or *jejunal biopsy) demonstrating the presence of PAS-positive (see periodic acid–Schiff reaction) macrophages containing the causative microorganism, Tropheryma whipplei. The disease usually responds to a prolonged course of antibiotics. [G. H. Whipple (1878–1976), US pathologist]

Whipple’s operation see pancreatectomy. [A. O. Whipple (1881–1963), US surgeon]

Whipple’s triad a combination of three clinical features that indicate the presence of an *insulinoma: (1) attacks of fainting, dizziness, and sweating on fasting; (2) severe hypoglycaemia present during the attacks; (3) relief from the attacks achieved by administering glucose. [A. O. Whipple]

whipworm n. a small parasitic whiplike nematode worm, Trichuris trichiura (Trichocephalus dispar), that lives in the large intestine. Eggs are passed out of the body with the faeces and human infection (see trichuriasis) results from the consumption of water or food contaminated with faecal material. The eggs hatch in the small intestine but mature worms migrate to the large intestine.

whistle-blowing n. expressing concerns about the professional performance of a member of staff, team, or organization. NHS organizations are required to have a whistle-blowing policy that sets out the procedures to be followed by those who wish to raise questions about an aspect of professional practice. See also public interest disclosure.

Whitaker’s test a direct percutaneous renal infusion test to investigate possible obstruction of the ureter or kidney. It detects subtle obstructions that cannot be detected by imaging. [R. Whitaker (20th century), British urologist]

white blood cell see leucocyte.

white fat see brown fat.

white finger the pale waxy appearance of a finger resulting from spasm of the vessels of the finger. It occurs in *Raynaud’s disease but can also be attributed to the long-term use of vibrating equipment (vibration white finger). In the latter case, it is a source of compensation claims.

white matter nerve tissue of the central nervous system that is paler in colour than the associated *grey matter because it contains more nerve fibres and thus larger amounts of the insulating material *myelin. In the brain the white matter lies within the grey layer of cerebral cortex; in the spinal cord it is between the arms of the X-shaped central core of grey matter.

white noise instrument a device, resembling a small hearing aid, that produces sounds of many frequencies at equal intensities and is used in the treatment of tinnitus. Also known as a broad-band sound generator, ear-level sound generator, noiser, or wide-band sound generator, it was formerly known as a tinnitus masker.

whitlow n. see paronychia.

WHO see World Health Organization.

WHO checklist a process introduced by the World Health Organization to improve patient safety and reduce errors during surgical procedures. There are three phases: checking before induction of anaesthesia; checking after administration of anaesthesia but before start of surgery (referred to as ‘time out’); and checking at the end of the procedure with identification of key concerns for the immediate postoperative period (referred to as ‘sign out’).

whoop n. a noisy convulsive drawing in of the breath following the spasmodic coughing attack characteristic of *whooping cough.

whooping cough an acute highly infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, primarily affecting infants and often occurring in epidemics. After an incubation period of 1–2 weeks there is a catarrhal stage, in which the infant has signs of an upper respiratory tract infection; transmission is through droplet spread. This is followed by an irritating cough that gradually becomes paroxysmal within 1–2 weeks. The paroxysms are followed by a characteristic *whoop and vomiting. In the very young the classical whoop may not develop and instead the paroxysms may be followed by periods of *apnoea. The illness can last 2–3 months, giving it the name ‘the cough of 100 days’ in some countries. Infection can be complicated by bronchopneumonia, weight loss due to repeated vomiting, *bronchiectasis, and convulsions due to *asphyxia or bleeding into the brain tissue. Minor complications include subconjunctival haemorrhage, *epistaxis (nosebleed), facial *oedema, and ulceration of the tongue.

*Immunization against the infection was introduced in the UK in the 1950s and offers protection. An attack usually confers lifelong immunity. Despite good vaccine coverage resulting in the current low levels of disease, whooping cough is still a significant cause of illness and death in the very young. Medical name: pertussis.

WHR see waist to hip ratio.

Widal reaction an *agglutination test for the presence of antibodies against the Salmonella organisms that cause typhoid fever. It is thus a method of diagnosing the presence of the disease in a patient and also a means of identifying the organisms in infected material. [G. F. I. Widal (1862–1929), French physician]

Williams syndrome a hereditary condition, caused by a defect (a *deletion) in chromosome 7, marked by a characteristic ‘elfin’ facial appearance (including large eyes, a wide mouth, and small chin), *hypercalcaemia, short stature, learning disabilities, and *aortic stenosis. Most affected children are highly sociable and have unusual conversational ability, using a rich and complex vocabulary. The condition can be diagnosed prenatally. [J. C. P. Williams (20th century), British physician]

Wilson’s disease an inborn defect of copper metabolism in which there is a deficiency of *caeruloplasmin (which normally forms a nontoxic complex with copper). It is inherited as an autosomal *recessive characteristic. The free copper may be deposited in the liver, causing jaundice and cirrhosis, or in the brain, causing learning disabilities and symptoms resembling *parkinsonism. There is a characteristic brown ring in the cornea (the Kayser–Fleischer ring). If the excess copper is removed from the body by regular treatment with *penicillamine both mental and physical deficits tend to improve. Medical name: hepatolenticular degeneration. [S. A. K. Wilson (1878–1936), British neurologist]

windigo psychosis a delusion of having been transformed into a windigo, a mythical monster that eats human flesh. It is often quoted as an example of a culture-specific syndrome (confined to certain North American Indian tribes).

windowing n. a technique of image manipulation commonly used in *cross-sectional imaging to manipulate a *grey scale image. Typically there is too much data obtained in a scan to see on a single image: the radiologist therefore chooses the window level centred on the density of the tissue of interest and a window width wide enough to include the densities of all the tissues that need to be seen. Tissues denser than this window usually appear white, and tissues darker appear black. Sometimes several different images of the same scan are required at different window settings to assess adequately all the necessary detail (for example, window settings to observe the lung are different from those for the bones or the soft tissues in the chest on CT). See also Hounsfield unit.

windpipe n. see trachea.

wisdom tooth the third permanent *molar tooth on each side of either jaw, which erupts normally around the age of 18 years.

Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome a rare *sex-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, *thrombocytopenia, and deficiency in the immune response (*immunodeficiency). It is caused by a decrease in the amount of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP: a protein occurring in lymphocytes, platelets, and other cells) due to a mutation in the WASP gene.

witch hazel (hamamelis) a preparation made from the leaves and bark of the tree Hamamelis virginiana, used as an *astringent, especially for the treatment of sprains and bruises.

withdrawal n. 1. (social withdrawal) (in psychology and psychiatry) the removal of one’s interest from one’s surroundings. See also bereavement. 2. see coitus interruptus. 3. see thought withdrawal. 4. (of treatment) the correct change to *palliative care when someone is *dying.

withdrawal symptoms see dependence.

Wohlfahrtia n. a genus of non-bloodsucking flies. Females of the species W. magnifica and W. vigil deposit their parasitic maggots in wounds and the openings of the body. This causes *myiasis, particularly in children.

Wolff–Chaikoff effect the inhibition of thyroid hormone production by administration of large doses of iodide. This occurs at a critical dosage level below which the addition of iodide to an iodine-deficient individual results in increased production of thyroid hormone. The effect is transient in individuals with normal thyroids but may persist in thyroiditis; it can be utilized medically to induce a hypothyroid state, for example in patients with *thyroid crisis (see Lugol’s solution). [L. Wolff (1898–1972), US cardiologist; I. L. Chaikoff (20th century), US physiologist]

Wolffian body see mesonephros. [K. F. Wolff (1733–94), German anatomist]

Wolffian duct see mesonephros.

Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome a congenital abnormality of heart conduction caused by the presence of an *accessory pathway of conduction between the atria and ventricles. It results in premature excitation of one ventricle and is characterized by an abnormal wave (delta wave) at the start of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram. The accessory pathway predisposes the patient to episodes of fast heart rate due to the rapid self-sustaining circulation of an electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles and back again (*atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia). Emergency treatment is in the form of drugs that temporarily block the re-entry circuit. Permanent destruction of the accessory pathway by *radiofrequency ablation is usually curative. [L. Wolff; Sir J. Parkinson (1885–1976), British physician; P. D. White (1886–1973), US cardiologist]

Wolfram syndrome (DIDMOAD syndrome) a rare syndrome consisting of a combination of *diabetes insipidus, *diabetes mellitus, *optic atrophy, and *deafness.

womb n. see uterus.

Wood’s light ultraviolet light filtered through a nickel oxide prism, which causes fluorescence in skin and hair affected by some fungal and bacterial infections and is therefore useful in diagnosis. For example, *erythrasma fluoresces coral pink, while scalp ringworm caused by Microsporum species fluoresces green. [R. W. Wood (1868–1955), US physician]

Woods’ screw manoeuvre an internal rotational manoeuvre to facilitate delivery in cases of *shoulder dystocia that have not responded to other measures. Using the fingertips of both hands, pressure is applied from behind the anterior shoulder and in front of the posterior shoulder. [C. E. Woods (20th century), US obstetrician]

woolsorter’s disease see anthrax.

word blindness see alexia.

working tax credit a benefit payable to working people with a low income. There are four categories of eligibility: a person responsible for a child; a disabled person; a person who is aged over 50, has recently started work, and was receiving certain benefits before starting work; and a person aged over 25 and working more than 30 hours per week. Working tax credit is in the process of being replaced by *universal credit.

World Health Organization (WHO) an international organization working to improve global public health. Membership is open to all countries, and the member states are divided into six regions; the United Kingdom is part of the WHO European Region. Health issues are discussed and policies evolved mainly through topic-specific working groups. WHO staff are seconded by invitation to advise countries on solving public health problems (especially infectious disease control). WHO handles information on the internationally *notifiable diseases, publishes the *International Classification of Diseases, and awards fellowships to enable health staff from poorer countries to obtain further training.

worm n. any member of several groups of soft-bodied legless animals, including flatworms, nematode worms, earthworms, and leeches, that were formerly thought to be closely related and classified as a single group – Vermes.

wormian bone one of a number of small bones that occur in the cranial sutures.

wound n. a break in the structure of an organ or tissue caused by an external agent. Bruises, grazes, tears, cuts, punctures, and burns are all examples of wounds.

wound colonization the presence of multiplying bacteria within a wound that do not cause inflammation or clinical symptoms. This may be due to the presence of natural flora or to environmental or endogenous factors. Healing is not delayed.

woven bone immature bone, in which the collagen fibres are arranged haphazardly and the cells have no specific orientation. It is typically found in the early stages of fracture healing, eventually being replaced by mature *lamellar bone.

Wuchereria n. a genus of white threadlike parasitic worms (see filaria) that live in the lymphatic vessels. W. bancrofti is a tropical and subtropical species that causes *elephantiasis, lymphangitis, and chyluria. The immature forms concentrate in the lungs during the day. At night they become more numerous in the blood vessels of the skin, from which they are taken up by blood-sucking mosquitoes, acting as carriers of the diseases they cause.





x


xanthaemia (carotenaemia) n. the presence in the blood of the yellow pigment *carotene, from excessive intake of carrots, tomatoes, or other vegetables containing the pigment.

xanthelasma n. yellow *plaques occurring symmetrically around the eyelids. It is quite common in elderly people and of no more than cosmetic importance, but in some cases it may be a manifestation of disorders of fat metabolism (hyperlipidaemia). The plaques may be removed surgically or by careful use of saturated trichoracetic acid.

xanthine n. a nitrogenous breakdown product of the purines adenosine and guanine. Xanthine is an intermediate product of the breakdown of nucleic acids to uric acid.

xantho- combining form denoting yellow colour.

xanthochromia n. yellow discoloration, such as may affect the skin (for example, in jaundice) or the cerebrospinal fluid (when it contains the breakdown products of haemoglobin from red blood cells that have entered it).

xanthoma n. (pl. xanthomata) a yellowish skin lesion associated with any of various disorders of lipid metabolism. There are several types of xanthomata. Tuberous xanthomata are found on the knees and elbows; tendon xanthomata involve the extensor tendons of the hands and feet and the Achilles tendon. Crops of small yellow papules at any site are known as eruptive xanthomata, while larger flat lesions are called plane xanthomata.

xanthomatosis n. the presence of multiple xanthomata in the skin. See xanthoma.

xanthophyll n. a member of a class of yellow carotenoid pigments found in green leaves. Examples of xanthophylls are *lutein, zeaxanthin, and *mesozeaxanthin.

Xeloda n. see capecitabine.

xeno- combining form denoting different; foreign; alien.

xenodiagnosis n. a procedure for diagnosing infections transmitted by insect carriers. Uninfected insects of the species known to carry the disease in question are allowed to suck the blood of a patient suspected of having the disease. A positive diagnosis is made if the disease parasites appear in the insects. This method has proved invaluable for diagnosing Chagas’ disease, using reduviid bugs (the carriers), since the parasites are not always easily detected in blood smears.

xenogeneic adj. describing grafted tissue derived from a donor of a different species.

xenograft (heterograft) n. a living tissue graft that is made from an animal of one species to another of a different species. For example, attempts have been made to graft animal organs into humans. *Bioengineering techniques are now available to produce animals whose *MHC is compatible with that of another species. Xenografts currently used include porcine heart valves and porcine skin for specific types of hernia repair. See also xenotransplantation.

xenon-133 n. a radioactive isotope that has a half-life of about five days and is used in ventilation scanning of the lungs in nuclear medicine (see ventilation-perfusion scanning). It gives off beta particles, which are responsible for the relatively high radiation dose compared to *krypton-81m. Symbol: Xe-133.

xenophobia n. excessive fear of strangers and foreigners. See phobia.

Xenopsylla n. a genus of tropical and subtropical fleas, with some 40 species. The rat flea, X. cheopis, occasionally attacks humans and can transmit plague from an infected rat population; it also transmits murine typhus and two tapeworms, *Hymenolepis nana and H. diminuta.

xenotransplantation n. the *transplantation of organs from one species into another. Experimental work into the feasibility of transplanting pig organs into human beings is under way. It includes the genetic manipulation of pig embryos to produce animals whose organs produce a human cell-surface protein and would therefore not be rejected at transplantation.

xeroderma n. a mild form of the hereditary disorder *ichthyosis, in which the skin develops slight dryness and forms branlike scales. It is common in the elderly. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare genetically determined disorder (see genodermatosis) in which there is an inherited defect in the *DNA repair mechanism in the skin, which corrects ultraviolet radiation damage; this leads to multiple skin cancers. Affected individuals must avoid exposure to sunlight.

xerophthalmia n. a progressive nutritional disease of the eye due to deficiency of *vitamin A. The cornea and conjunctiva become dry, thickened, and wrinkled. This may progress to *keratomalacia and eventual blindness.

xeroradiography n. a type of X-ray imaging in which a picture of the body is recorded on paper rather than on film. A plate of selenium, which rests on a thin layer of aluminium oxide, is charged uniformly by passing it in front of a scorotron. As X-ray photons impinge on this, charges diffuse out in proportion to the energy content of the X-ray. An imprint is formed by the charge distribution on the plate, which attracts toner particles and is transferred to reusable paper plates. Unlike conventional X-ray imaging, xeroradiography does not require photographic developers. The technique does, however, require more radiation exposure. It was widely used in mammography prior to the advent of digital mammography.

xerosis n. abnormal dryness of the conjunctiva, the skin, or the mucous membranes. Xerosis affecting the conjunctiva is due to changes in the membrane itself, which becomes thickened and grey in the area exposed when the eyelids are open.

xiphisternum n. see xiphoid process.

xiphoid process (xiphoid cartilage) the lowermost section of the breastbone (see sternum): a flat pointed cartilage that gradually ossifies until it is completely replaced by bone, a process not completed until after middle age. It does not articulate with any ribs. Also called: ensiform process or cartilage, xiphisternum.

X-linked disease see sex-linked.

X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP syndrome, Duncan’s disease) a hereditary disorder of the immune system caused by a defective *sex-linked gene carried on an *X chromosome. There is uncontrolled proliferation of B-*lymphocytes in response to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus, which can lead to fulminating hepatitis or lymphoma. This condition is due to a defect in a gene, SAP, which encodes a signalling molecule found in the cytoplasm of cells.

XLP syndrome see X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome.

Xolair n. see omalizumab.

X-rays pl. n. electromagnetic radiation of extremely short wavelength (beyond the ultraviolet), which pass through matter to varying degrees depending on its density. X-rays are produced when high-energy beams of electrons strike matter. They are physically indistinguishable from gamma rays, produced during radioactive decay. Both are used in diagnostic *radiology (see radiography; nuclear medicine) and in *radiotherapy. Great care is needed to avoid unnecessary exposure, because the radiation is harmful to all living things (see ionization; radiation sickness). Heavy elements, such as lead and barium, tend to stop X-rays and can be used to shield people from unwanted exposure to ionizing radiation.

X-ray screening the use of an image intensifier to produce *real-time imaging during an X-ray examination on a TV monitor. It is widely used in angiography and *interventional radiology to guide procedures. See videofluoroscopy.

xylene (dimethylbenzene) n. a liquid used for increasing the transparency of tissues prepared for microscopic examination after dehydration. See clearing.

xylometazoline n. a *sympathomimetic drug that constricts blood vessels (see vasoconstrictor). It is applied topically as a nasal decongestant for the relief of the common cold and sinusitis. Toxic effects are rare, but the congestion may worsen transiently when treatment stops.

yaws (pian, framboesia) n. a tropical infectious disease caused by the spirochaete Treponema pertenue in the skin and its underlying tissues. Yaws occurs chiefly in conditions of poor hygiene. It is transmitted by direct contact with infected persons and their clothing and possibly also by flies of the genus Hippelates. The spirochaetes enter through abrasions on the skin. Initial symptoms include fever, pains, and itching, followed by the appearance of small tumours, each covered by a yellow crust of dried serum, on the hands, face, legs, and feet. These tumours may deteriorate into deep ulcers. The final stage of yaws, which may appear after an interval of several years, involves destructive and deforming lesions of the skin, bones, and periosteum (see also gangosa; goundou). Yaws, which commonly affects children, is prevalent in hot humid lowlands of equatorial Africa, tropical America, the Far East, and the West Indies. It responds well to antibiotics.

Y chromosome a sex chromosome that is present in men but not in women. It carries the SRY (sex reversal on Y) gene, which encodes a protein (testis-determining factor, or SRY protein) that switches the default female pathway of embryonic development to the male pathway by initiating testis formation. Compare X chromosome.

years of life lost (YLL, years of potential life lost, YPLL, potential years of life lost, PYLL) a measure of premature mortality that calculates the number of additional years a person could have expected to live, on average, had they not died prematurely. A reference age intended to represent the total number of years a person can expect to live, on average, is required for the calculation: this is often given in square brackets after YLL. Negative values for YLL are not used: if somebody survives longer than the reference age, their YLL is calculated as 0. YLLs for different diseases can be compared across populations to give an indication of which diseases carry the greatest burden of premature mortality.

yeast n. any of a group of fungi in which the body (mycelium) consists of individual cells, which may occur singly, in groups of two or three, or in chains. Yeasts reproduce by budding and by the formation of sexual spores (in the case of the perfect yeasts) or asexual spores (in the case of the imperfect yeasts). Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces) ferments carbohydrates to produce alcohol and carbon dioxide and is important in brewing and breadmaking. Some yeasts are a commercial source of proteins and of vitamins of the B complex. Yeasts that cause disease in humans include *Candida, *Cryptococcus, and *Malassezia.

yellow fever an infectious disease, caused by an *arbovirus, occurring in tropical Africa and the northern regions of South America. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, principally Aëdes aegypti. The virus causes degeneration of the tissues of the liver and kidneys. Symptoms, depending on severity of infection, include chill, headache, pains in the back and limbs, fever, vomiting, constipation, a reduced flow of urine (which contains high levels of albumin), and *jaundice. The more serious cases may prove fatal, but recovery from a first attack confers subsequent immunity. The disease is treated by fluid replacement and can be prevented by vaccination.

yellow spot see macula.

yolk sac (vitelline sac) the membranous sac, composed of mesoderm lined with endoderm, that lies ventral to the embryo. It is one of the *extraembryonic membranes. Its initially wide communication with the future gut is later reduced to a narrow duct passing through the *umbilicus. It probably assists in transporting nutrients to the early embryo and is one of the first sites where blood cells are formed.

YPLL see years of life lost.

yttrium-90 n. an artificial radioactive isotope of the element yttrium used in *radiotherapy.

Zanamivir is used for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B. To be effective, the drug must be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms (for treatment) or within 36 hours of exposure (for prevention). It is liable to cause tightening of the bronchial tubes and this may be dangerous in people with asthma.

Zantac n. see ranitidine.

zeaxanthin n. see lutein.

zein n. a protein found in maize.

zidovudine (AZT) n. a *reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection. The drug slows the growth of HIV infection in the body, but is not curative.

However, infection during pregnancy can result in brain abnormalities of the fetus, notably *microcephaly. Zika virus can also trigger *Guillain–Barré syndrome. Infection is usually from a mosquito bite, although the virus may also be transmitted by sexual intercourse.

zinc n. a *trace element that is a cofactor of many enzymes: it is important in the immune response and has structural properties in some proteins. Deficiency is rare with a balanced diet but may occur in alcoholics and those with kidney disease; symptoms include lesions of the skin, oesophagus, and cornea, alopecia, and (in children) retarded growth. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 9.5 μg/day for men and 7.0 μg/day for women (an additional 6 μg is needed during lactation). Symbol: Zn.

zinc undecenoate (zinc undecylenate) an antifungal agent with uses similar to those of *undecenoic acid.

zoledronic acid (zolendronate) a *bisphosphonate drug that is used to treat Paget’s disease and malignant *hypercalcaemia and is also establishing a role in treating bone metastases, both in terms of symptom relief and preventing bone fractures.

Zollinger–Ellison syndrome a rare disorder in which there is excessive secretion of gastric juice due to high levels of circulating *gastrin, which is produced by a pancreatic tumour (see gastrinoma) or an enlarged pancreas. The high levels of stomach acid cause diarrhoea and peptic ulcers, which may be multiple, in unusual sites (e.g. jejunum), or which may quickly recur after *vagotomy or partial *gastrectomy. Treatment with proton-pump inhibitors, by removal of the tumour (if benign), or by total gastrectomy is usually effective. [R. M. Zollinger (1903–92) and E. H. Ellison (1918–70), US physicians]

8. Medical certificates




(commonly used forms)





SC2


Self-certification form used by an employee to provide their employer with details of sick absences of four or more consecutive days (SC1 for unemployed or self-employed).





Statement of fitness for work (‘fit note’)


Issued when the patient has been off work for more than seven days. It allows the doctor to advise one of two options:

• Not fit for work: the patient is unfit for work and is advised to refrain from work for a stated period of time.

• May be fit for work: the patient may not be able to complete all his or her normal duties or hours, or they may need some support to undertake these.





DS 1500


Issued to a person suffering from a potentially terminal illness (defined by Social Security legislation) where death as a consequence of the illness “can reasonably be expected within six months”. This allows rapid access to claiming personal independence payment (PIP) or disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) under “special rules”.





9. Doctors’ training grades





Foundation training


Doctors in the UK who have completed medical school undertake the Foundation Programme. This is a two-year postgraduate general medical training programme, and junior doctors undertaking this training are referred to as:

• FY1 or F1 (Foundation training year 1)

• FY2 or F2 (Foundation training year 2)





FY1 doctors rotate through three or four jobs in different hospital specialties. In year two, there is often training in general practice or academic medicine as well as hospital specialties.





Specialty training


Until August 2019, doctors who completed the Foundation Programme either directly entered specialty training or undertook core training (core medical training or core surgical training). This phase of training is typically for two years, and doctors are referred to as:

• CT1 (core training year 1)

• CT2 (core training year 2)





or

• ST1 (specialty training year 1)

• ST2 (specialty training year 2)





ST2 doctors progress automatically to year 3 specialty training, while CT2 doctors apply for specialty training at this level. The training grade is:

• ST3 (specialty training year 3)





ST3 doctors then undertake a further 4–6 years of training according to their chosen specialty (ST4, ST5, etc.).

On successful completion of the specialist training, the doctor receives a certificate of completion of training (CCT), which will make them eligible for entry to the GMC’s Specialist Register or GP Register.

From August 2019 no new entrants will be admitted to CT1-2 or ST1-2. These pathways are replaced by a new programme of Internal Medicine Training (IMT), under which all entrants spend two years training in general adult medicine with a focus on acute and long-term conditions (IMT1–2). For their third year trainees may either (1) continue their study of general medicine while also beginning to train in an acute specialism, or (2) concentrate on a non-acute specialism.

Doctors who complete this programme will then be able to practise as GPs or pursue futher specialist training as at present.

11. Units of alcohol





Units and ABV


1 unit is 10 ml (8 g) of pure alcohol.

It is difficult to tell how many units are in different drinks as this is dependent on the size of the measure and its strength. The strength of alcoholic drink is expressed as % of alcohol by volume (ABV), and this is printed on the label of a bottle (or on the container): for example, 13.5% ABV (or vol).

The relationship between units and ABV is given by a simple formula:



For example:

one glass of 12% wine (125 ml) would contain:



one pint of 5.3% beer (just over 500 ml) would contain:





Recommended intake


The Department of Health and Social Care recommends a maximum weekly intake of no more than 14 units for both men and women and suggests that this should be spread across 3 or more days with ‘several’ drink-free days each week. Current guidelines recommend that alcohol should be avoided during pregnancy to reduce the risks of low birth weight and organ defects. Women who find that they are pregnant having drunk alcohol during the early part of their pregnancy should avoid further drinking but should also be aware that the risk of harm to their babies is likely to be low. However, women who consistently drink above the recommended alcohol intake risk their child being born with fetal alcohol syndrome.
