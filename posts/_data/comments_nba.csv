Thoughts on Malika and Stephen A having a disagreement?
I can&#39;t believe this is actually a debate in America. Sorry but y&#39;all are rediculous.<br><br><br>First of all: who cares even the slightest bit about them being in a relationship? that being said, if it&#39;s company policy, then it&#39;s on them. THEM not HIM. Second: How in the world is it possible that the guy gets put on inactive, further gets wrongfully blamed about criminal charges, while the woman by figure of speach gets a fundraising for the harm that has been done to her.<br><br>That&#39;s American equality right there. Don&#39;t want to make this a geographical matter, but you can&#39;t even make that type of shit up in Europe, let alone have this type of shitshow around it.
She acts like she is owed stuff; <br>info that’s none of the media’s or the public’s business,  <br>impunity in baseless insinuations of a co-worker’s “misogyny”<br>the complete capitulation to her “authority -  she “appreciates” Stephen A’s “clarification,” as if Stephen A owes her that. As if Stephen A is supposed to be so grateful Malika Andrews accepted his clarification.<br>I’m sorry, but Ms. Andrews is no longer a media figure I trust.
My question is why do they allow people like her to be on sport shows like this, no depth and weight at all just pure emotion and bias opinions, it’s never facts with these people
“That is NOT, why we are here😂😂🤣🤣😭😭 I’m rolling…. The way she said that shxt.
Who did this man sleep with?
I&#39;m with Candace Owens. Basicslly shouldnt even hire women because something as small as friendly conversation can get u fired/canceled. Im not saying this is the case, but my point is valid i believe. Problems regarding sex in the workplace is almost completely onesided like divorce and family court have been for the majority of its time
Again, her tone. Is this just how she talks to people?
we all know a chick like malika
I love you Steven A !!!!👍🏾
She’s projecting. She’s probably doing the same shit. Sleeping around.
smh stephen shows are full of yelling lol all the men yell at him including Pat Bev so why can&#39;t malika banter?
Her “all of the information “ line! She said that 800 times…yeah actually all the information you need was already known! Everyone always wants more done when more is not needed! This broad needed a little Steven A Smith hard love
ESPN better move on from Malika Asap. Working with her is like walking on eggshells. She keeps that victim card in her front pocket.
Malika has a pretty face but she&#39;s a manhating c0mm13 fem1n1st.
fruitbusiness. its the era.
Malika needs her own show or to move off this one
Malika has somehow elevated herself into a middle of the screen position at the WOKE ESPN and she&#39;s absolutely ready to play the part.  It will be interesting to see how much rope ESPN gives her now that they&#39;ve kind of created a SJW monster.
“We are NOT here to blame women.” Uh, why? The man has already been held accountable. Why are women coddled in the work place?
The generic i&#39;m guilty line &quot;We do not have all the information here&quot;.
She folded like a stray dog.
Here&#39;s the thing, in these kinds of scenarios whenever a WOMAN also needs to be held accountable, it becomes a sensitive issue to people because when you call them out, then think you&#39;re calling out WOMEN, &quot;we are not here to further blame women!&quot; like yeah bro we know lol, we&#39;re not blaming women, we&#39;re blaming A WOMAN
She Talking To Stephen A  Like That Because she Want him To Smash So She can have A Seat Like That Playa 😄😆😄😆😄
Why isnt the lady been punished, we dont know anything about her and only he is being punished, they were together after the fact of a relationshup, she i was trying to take the blame off her and shove it on to him.
What a troll good thing she isn’t respected in her field otherwise she could do damage to the institution instead she is putting women and blacks back
When Malcolm X was sentenced for his crime and placed in jail … he later spoke of what he felt was his real crime as viewed by those with power … the similarities are eerily similar…
Been criticizing SAS for years , Finally i found a reason to support him, this trash reporter thought she can just talk and say whatever she wants to SAS and the ex-players on e every panel she was in, just because she&#39;s a woman as she always does and I remmeber she tried to shut down Perk and now SAS , get rid of this nonesense or you&#39;ll be having no views the ratings I guarantee they&#39;re already down
Takes two to tango.
Women fighting for gender equality when it favors them.
smh..... Udoka got what he deserved it is what it is
I&#39;ve always thought malika is an incredible talent shes right up there with rachel nichols, but this was immature wokeness at its finest.
Translation for what Malika said: Women should never be held accountable and only men should be punished
You supposed to say sorry haahaa bull
I get that Ime&#39;s high profile, but shouldn&#39;t the exposure/blame be EQUAL for him &amp; the woman??
Fire everyone.
Gotta give him credit, I don&#39;t recall hearing him flip-flop often. And he&#39;s kept the same energy on this since the &quot;news&quot; broke
Tell it like it is Stephen A.... Love this man.
Who the heck is Malika
Yes, women don’t cheat and are innocent. How dare they bring the girl into light! 🤡
So let me get this straight (for the hundreth time).  Workplace violations by the coach and the staffer - both were guilty of the violations.  The man gets suspended and no actions were taken against the female.  But let&#39;s also be clear, Stephen A (who I dislike intensely) can not say this or he would be fired by ESPN.  What a fucked up world we live in.  And lets not let Stephen A Smith off the hook here, his argument of &quot;it has always been handled privately in the past&quot; is just about the most BS line he has ever said.  Lets substitute in a racist acusation instead of what happened and see what he says about the &quot;value&quot; of keeping things internal just like they always have been.
😂
Right on point, Malika is treating it like he harassed her and took advantage. When it was said from the start it was CONSENSUAL. Both should get blamed.
Protecting a woman that also broke policy at work. She wasn’t taken advantage of, and wasn’t a victim.
That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with these women now don&#39;t want to be held accountable for anything they got going on or they doing
We need to get the woman’s name too
DAMN STEVE  FACTS
I love Stephen A. Smith. Malika is way way way out of line!!!
Who promoted Malika? With Steven A all the way.
Thanks Stephen A,
The chic involved needs to be suspended as well….and Malika needs to understand that she is a woman and no matter how bad it sounds she needs to know her place…..Ime is being dogged because he’s black and the trick he smashed is white
Stephen A is just such a highlight lol he’s completely in the right and I agree with him 100% on this. 100%.
This woman needs to stop this. She making this a women vs men battle. That’s not the way to do this babygirl. Ur cute self. But stop it baby
She acts just like Michelle Beadle
Why does she need to know what happened? It’s none of her damn business!
Stephen A needs to get his money together and go buy a Team. Then this no it all can hire any degenerate he wants to coach and play for him. Time for him to put his money or at least whatever money little man has and go stand with the big boys.<br>Little man is jealous of America’s Team the Dallas Cowboys! Tell him Jimmy “How bout them Cowboys!!!
She tried that STOP shiz. ✋️ SAS said not on my show. Smh. By herself she will eventually.
Should of conferenced called in Rachel Nichols for her opinion...
Stephen A. handled it so so well.  He the man!!!!
She&#39;s talking down to him like he&#39;s a child or something. Such disrespect and condescending language all based on feelings and not facts. And she&#39;s 1/2 this man&#39;s age. I&#39;m glad he shut it down with a swiftness.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23firemalika">#FireMalika</a> or bench her for a year
I can not STAND her! Like idgaf.. no! She was WRONG, her tone was AWFUL &amp; on top of that. NO BOTH parties or none at all should be exposed. Like df. Protect one but not the other? Both have families and friends and etc and need protecting from the criticism. Not only one.
Aside from your irrelevant use of the word “yelling”, good commentary. Nobody not once yelled at anyone
Good job Stephen A.
Haha Listen Felicia’ I think S.A.S has just a little bit more pull in the NBA than YOU! He has more insight and may know more people than You- The issues that You want to argue about his comments on his show, and cut him off on his show... lol damn Felicia I will say you have balls, but your wrong! Just couse your African American and a woman on ESPN you think you have some pull?!? Sorry you are wrong! That’s suck BS- you need a Goddam reality check!! You said “we are obviously missing a key part to this story!” No YOU!! You were
Proud of Stevie. That’s how you stand your ground against these unruly unprofessional women!
Shawty need to be suspended and fired to. She was the one that blew up the spot. This malika shawty a goof.
Take HER OFF THE AIR!! I need Udoka to sue. Both parties should be held accountable. So that organization is discriminatory towards HIM! Men can be victims as well!!
This woman even argued and forced her point against ballers like RJ, Matt, and Perk as if she knows more than them 😂
Women think they&#39;re feminists but don&#39;t know the first thing about being a feminist.
How she acted is why   &quot;most&quot; woman don&#39;t need to be involved in businesses like this.
I blame ESPN. She needs to be fired or we stop watching ESPN. I&#39;m kind of tired of it anyway. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23espn">#espn</a>
Bounce her cornball plastic ass outta here... reporting  sports highlights is your job nobody&#39;s interested in your views it a sports show and your  ego got lifted and now you&#39;ve bumped your head and your feeling it  but yo remember just like they replaced you for Rachel and Jamell Hill Michelle Beatle the list doesn&#39;t stop protect your neck cause once they feel your  getting in the way of the  money..Bye !!!!!
All this woman is doing is black man bashing. Stephen A. never said anything about a woman and this woman knows that. She is a disrespectful brat.
Malika is the type of person who thinks Twitter is real life.  If she had any class she would of apologized to Stephen A. on air but as we all know,  accountability is like kryptonite to these bitches.
She won’t be on there again lol
Missing key piece of information
I’m so glad Stephen a got her back
her &amp; that sage girl must be sisters
I wonder if anybody at ESPN respect this woman. Malika is trying to women victims. You don&#39;t think that woman he an affair with knew it was wrong. I think ESPN should let her go she&#39;s just as annoying as Molly
If Malika Andrews was an attorney she would have represented Amber Heard in trial
Lmao she gets away with it with everyone in that network but him 😂 he’s the only one Disney can’t fully control under their Umbrella. That’s what carrying a dead franchise does
Her tone is lame lol
She’s a clown
Girl you are debating a wrong man,you need more experience in the job to win this battle
Bring back Rachel instead of this bum 😢
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23malika">#Malika</a> Need to “Shut Up And Dribble” Lmfao. She’s definitely part of that Blind Feminist movement. Where all females in ANY compromising situation are excluded from being blamed.
Malika andrews is a feminist and both parties should always be accountable and if a woman fucks up she needs to be help accountable period play stupid games win stupid prizes and she’s gonna lose her career being Rachel nichols back
He said the first time now he’s gotta say it a second time.
I think the issue with this isn’t the fact that it was consensual or anything to do with sexuality or sex. The reason Udoka was suspended was because of the power dynamic. A female boss can’t mess around with a subordinate. That’s all really .
What is up with these female nba hosts being so dam toxic. Beadle. Nichols. Andrews. And even Taylor? I guess idk what happened with her leaving . But dam they really get on there high horse. So gassed up and ignorant .
This is how black women are treated by black men in this country
Stephen A lit her up 😂😂🤣🤣
She wasn’t yelling. That’s a stretch. Also it sounded like she misinterpreted what he was saying. Once that was clear all was well.
M. Andrew&#39;s....terrible
These woke women are going overboard? Time for men of culture to put them in their place.
That&#39;s why woman should stay in there lane and stick to doing woman sports .this girl is waaaaaack
I rarely agree with Stephen A., but he&#39;s spot on.
He slept with a minority owners wife.... =^0 we lucky they didn&#39;t hang ol boy in Boston
I don’t care what she thinks. I’m blaming the coach and the women.
