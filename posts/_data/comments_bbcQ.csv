All contries need to leave Fifa- modern day slavery is evil
How many slaves for hundred of years have died in europe .lets talk about that .
If you shop at a load of big companies, some of the top top companies still use child labour and  have shoddy work conditions, factories. I just don&#39;t think you can complain when it suits you with human rights, do some digging/research and you may never shop at a place again. <br><br>The World Cup should never be given to a country with no infrastructure in place to begin with. But now its ready, enjoy it so their lives weren&#39;t in vain.
this a propaganda by the western media, by downgrading qatar, this is the fault of the contractor not the qatar government.
hahaha Qatar made a 30 year gas deal with China thats why you are now seeing anti Qatar news wake up kids
And funny things all workers are indian wow 😂😂😂😂 lmao if they could not feed own nation so easily allegation on others great tactics indians  😂😂😂
Ya they’re just upset about the gay thing, nothing else. Keep it in the closet freaks.
Bbcc tries their best putting dirt on Muslim countries why? Many western force people steal other countries gold or underground properties in many histories? For your information please search the employer any true agents related this.
Tbey conveniently criticize Qatar but never Zionists who control the banks and are responsible for poverty in Africa. They rob their diamonds and gold for the price of a big mac sandwich then floor their countries with debts and interests and then blame Qatar for its God given harsh humid climate. Wait Indonesia Thailand Malaysia UAE Bahrain Oman Kuwait Saudi etc have harsh humid weathers and every employee who dies there is not God but Qatar&#39;s responsibility because they secretly altered their own climate to be a miserable one in a Hollywood movie I&#39;ve seen it
The problem is Qatar standards for foreign workers in need is not aligned with Human rights and they don&#39;t even realise where os the problem. They don&#39;t consider them equal human beings.
Finally someone has morals!!!  Bbc you guys are hypocrites and liars
I am not sure you can blame it 100% on Qatar. But these BBC news  does nitpicks and want to cause uproar to Qatar.<br>1) Indian workers tend to do short cuts to save cost and time and therefore makes risky and less safety work. Ask any Indian construction about it. They will mostly agree with this.<br>2) Between the Qatar companies and the workers, there are usually middle men. These men are not all saintly. Most of them are Indians as well.<br>3) Not all Indians are Hindus. Some of the victims are Muslims.
Muslims approve slavery
Qatar is not in charge of the 6,000 deaths, but China is in charge. This is because all World Cup stadiums and all roads and other facilities were built exclusively by China. Qatar just paid for it. The world should kneel in protest against Communist China, not Qatar.
Qatar is Too Bold Enough to Hide &amp; Lie of  Crimes by Help of Their Fake Democracy also known as Kafara Until Now!!
sometimes theres work place accidents in life. even in the west. its the 40 degree heat and lack of decent air conditioning and lodgings thats the real problem i have and they should get paid well for their work.
India BC gulaam ke gulaam hi rakhoge
Lies 😅
Saudi price giving cars and lexuarious things to footballers ....??? These people sufferd and died they don&#39;t have any compensation government is just shiit
For once please don&#39;t make false statement...media is the main problems.
People they treated like slave but the wages is poor🤦‍♀️
The EX_colonial empire that still refuses to apologise pretends to care about these poor people.
It&#39;s their country they can make Indian and Pak slaves to work till death for their stadium.<br>They can ban alcohol, they can kill homosexual people even homosexual football players and even they can bribe everyone who go against to make their mouth shut.<br>It&#39;s their culture their country their choice.
Did u remember the BBC propaganda when the US invaded Iraq.. i remember 2 million human died in a false war.. which the BBC is covered all the way to its albow in blood.. this zionist media ..be aware of it.
Any bts 💜 army ⟬⟭💜
Qatar got no chill.we don&#39;t give a 💩 about bbC🤣
FIFA  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR  EVERYONE
human life cannot be taken for granted we must need to boycott this world cup. that&#39;s so important to set an example to those who think they can do anything and can get away with it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycottqatarworldcup">#boycottqatarworldcup</a>
Yeaaah no... Screw you Qatar.
Relatively little comment about Iran &amp; Saudi playing in the comp, I notice. Hardly bastions of civil liberty.
<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE41WESEsvA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE41WESEsvA</a>Islamophobia?mily is enjoying because some other family in other part of the world suffered for your comforts. It costed the life of their loved ones but the truth is that nobody cares.
Do brits clean public toilets?
Just to give an insight don’t forget to mention the workers who suffered horrific conditions building the stadium in the EU countries and South America due to accidents, sexual assaults, alcoholism incidents and rape etc. Its better to include the whole group and not exclude anyone
Western Satanic media stop lying you so mad that Qatar creating the best world cup in history! <br>I Also Feel bad for this people who believe that westerns care about human rights when they are the main reason of all wars and problems in earth ! Lol
Qatar is a terrorist supporting state. They&#39;re disgusting why even allow the world cup there?
Brown males are always exploited for commercial gain.
It is always melanated people who suffer at the expense of the system.
Slaves they get their passports taken. As well as not being paid

BBC stands for British Bullshit Corporation  fake news virtue signalling again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
whos gonna fight for them ??😒will they ever get justice😟?? the oldman whos son died has left the hope for justice also, poor people think its their fate 😔
They really be living in 2077 company&#39;s don&#39;t give a shit kill the people as they please the government and other countrymen don&#39;t give a fuck. Great world you guys built for the next generation 👏 👏👏
Qatar is radical supporting country it&#39;s supports terrorist UN should trade  sanction Qatar
Aa, wasn’t the bid for the construction won by American and British companies?
BBC refused to telecast the opening ceremony, but they telecast these. 🤣
BBC we want a documentary about the  migrants and refugees to Europe and the appalling record of human rights where migrants get drowned and shot brutally humiliated at the shores of Europe do you think you have guts to air such a doc?
They suck the blood of South aisan labour.
Great job BBC 👏 for showing the reality.
Stop going to gulf for any thing...
Bbc is jealous on India
I’m proud to be Indian<br><br>stadium in Qatar made by India engineer 💪🏿<br><br>🇮🇳 JAI HIND JAI BHARAT 🇮🇳
FIFA is 100% accountable for the deaths the construction workers.   Shame on them.
All Kerala people 😂😂😂😂
Qatar is a good country.When we go to some country try to respect their culture and live according to them when we are there. Why you are not telling how migrant workers are treated in your country.The most terrible countries in this world is Europe and western countries 😂😂
But the BBC is still covering the World Cup, I suppose all that money makes things better.
Who made kit for uk and USA team 🤔? Nike! A company that was linked to forced labor from the Uyghur people in China. HYPOCRISY!!! Just because Qatar refused to accept perverted western values of lgbtshit, alcohol and objectifying women
FIFA World Cup  I am the mysterious Alif Lâm Mïm of the 3 times Holy Koran, 3 mysterious letters above The Cow, second chapter. <br><br>Qatar 2022 World Cup workers have died or suffered abuse, investigation finds – BBC News  Hell is a real place where I went often. It is filled with unimaginable Terror. Zombies roam about, the sun looks like a tiny dot in strangely high sky and moves waywardly about. Time does not exist in Hell. May the rich know God&#39;s grace and be saved by treating workers fairly, paying them good wages and respecting women&#39;s rights and LGBT rights. Respect of the environment and of God&#39;s creation is also another concern to get into Heaven.
Come on you people cant see good in anything...criticize middle east for the acts of europe!!
What about the workers in india? What about the died farmers? Tell me mister..  stupid
How many Iraqis and Afghanis did UK soldiers slaughter ????<br>Now you worry about “human rights “<br>Bunch of hypocritical two faced fools 😡
This has been occurring for years in the UAE and Qatar. Sadly I don&#39;t think things will in these countries.
wht are we playing football in a country that kills innicent people because the saudi princes enjoy watching innicent people being exicuted for petty crimes the world should be asahamed.
What about all the migrant workers that died in dubai, Saudi building their skyscraper or does it only apply when your trying to push your agenda. What a bunch of hypocrites
Oh BBC... there you go again with your negative coverage that&#39;s absolutely full of total hypocrisy, misinformation and intended misguidance of the actual truth and reality on ground... You need to take a good look at your country/UK’S history including all the atrocities and human rights violations you committed against fellow human beings in your colonies whom you treated worse than animals... does thus ring a bell? So what gives you the right to assume the position of moral high ground and you think you can lecture everyone else but yourselves? STOP HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS! <br><br>In, we say &quot;A MONKEY DOESN’T SEE IT&#39;S OWN RED BUTT but it sees the red butt of other monkeys&quot; and this is exactly what BBC and all Western media outlets do on 24/7 - you only see your purported versions of faults of others and never your own! STOP IT!
Even in Japan at construction sites sometimes workers are killed by accident. But not so many, like one or two. Some employers treat employees awful too, but such a thing is finally revealed. In my country it’s not easy to die so our society can’t accept death easily, no matter where people are from. Where is the humanity?
I worked in Qatar and the way these people were treated was truly disgraceful
How people are still supporting this failed world cup (&amp; therefore Qatar) is beyond me. Qatar literally used SLAVE LABOUR.
Go talk about CC in Egypt who killed more than 100,000 innocent people and put more than 60,000 people in prison
Western propaganda!!! Open ur eyes
Finally covered this, too late the stadium already been built and the people have died
Shame on FIFA , for awarding the World Cup host status to Qatar. Abysmal &amp; despicable,  to say the least. Reeks of the highest level of corruption &amp; human rights abuse. Pained.
Qatar is a joke.
BBC is a anime for Qatar and all moslim world.
Western world (US + EU)  killed million million people’s in last century 🤬 Everybody know that.
Rishi is Pakistani-British, does he know how Pakistani, Indians and Nepalese are treated in Qatar????  like rubbish!  This world cup should be banned!

So we didn’t say anything while this homophobic and abuse money was lavished on psg and Man City? None of the players or anyone spoke up, But suddenly now it’s not ok?
False. USA and UK have been doing way much more and the media controls the narrative. Because the Arab world didnt follow the Western ideology, they decided to spread fake rumors one of which is the amount of deaths in the stadium
Why do you go there to work if you think it is risk to work. It does not make sense to me. BBC, please stop this propaganda.
500,000 Iraqis died in an illegal war that most western nations has supported, of which 200,000 are Iraqi citizens and we are concerned about 6,500 migrant workers in Qatar? The war in Iraq can even be called genocide and a war crime.................
We know all about it ... all the people from western colonies in Africa, South America, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent still feel the pain.
Just shut the f up and focus on football. Human right this that f off it’s done now. Just makes you realise how racist the English are. You don’t step into someone else’s house and make your own f*<b>***</b> rules. Dickheads.
Black lives matter but not poor workers 🤦....
Doha is not fit for fifa wc....
INTERESTING THE JEALOSY WHITE U.K MEDIA  PEOLE HAVE AGAINST A BEAUTFUL COUNTRY HOSTING WORLD CUP 2022
AND GREAT BRITAIN KILLED MILLIONS OF INDIAN PEOPLE..  AFRICANS,  AUSTRALIANS PEOLE.  COLONISATION !!!
Hypocrisy
Lie
So many countries with existing stadiums and without stone age, archaic rules and human rights violations. Bad call for them to host it. Fyre festival 2.0 but far far worse
People complain Uk want it long time again and there you go the new is he.
Really I don’t condone what Qatar has done but Europeans shouldn’t talk about humans rights, especially when they forced ppl to work for free in worser condition and still killing innocent like invading Iraq and many other countries, first fix your shit and then talk about others, fr I had enough of this RIP to the workers but Europeans have done worse and are still accountable to many worser things going around the word, ppl taking about banning alcohol in the stadium how is that a problem when England, Spain and other countries don’t allow as well, I feel like it’s about race and religion and football isn’t for others just for Europeans fr fr it’s Propaganda to included others and then treat them differently fr fr it’s jokes, what fifa leader said was 💯 facts but they called it bizarre and defending Qatar which wasn’t the chase.
I think western media targetting Qatar unfairly
It’s a shame that BBC is still throwing its venom against sports. It was their stupidity at the time of the bidding that Britain lost this opportunity to host this world cup 2022. Also it is struggling with it’s economy, poverty, dirty politics and post Brexit issues that it is in no position to host this cup in the next 40-50 years.
The most expensive grave yard of migrant workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, India. They spilled their sweat, blood even lost their lives to entertain Qatari people. The Qatar authority is abusing the workers human rights.
Fuck qatar
Qatar is destroying football, starting with qatar saint germain the most plastic club in football history
BBC=British Bullshit Channel
US and Europe should bring all those migrant workers from middle East to their country and give them visa and work
Rip to those who lost their lives in Qatar, but accidents happen everywhere. These workers already knew that this job is not the safest in the world.<br>Also, the total number of people who died during the preparation for the world cup is 3 and not 6500, so stop spreading false news!
Can the BBC come to Guyana 🇬🇾 and do this.We as construction workers have been suffering from this for the past 40 years..
These kinds of massive sporting events should never be given to countries that we know don&#39;t respect any international human rights and have a long history of every kind of abuse and human rights violations... It&#39;s a corrupt system with people in power who lack any ethics and have very low moral standards...
This hits me really hard.I was during the pandemic a immigrant construction worker,and I was also abused and forced to work in bad conditions where saftey was ignored a lot of the time.And I also had a workplace accident that was caused by ignored safety protocals.But a mild one.Just like them I went because I didnt have anywhere else to go so I stood thinking it would get <a href="http://better.it/">better.It</a> didnt,it only got worse.But when the pandemic was over I left back to my home country and watching this I really feel for thease workers.And I hope everyone who is going to the world cup  see&#39;s this.
Rip to the workers. The politicians and football people that agreed and set this up, have blood on the their hands
Shame on Qatar and FIFA
I mean, it would be great to have a World Cup where people were treated fairly, with respect. I guess that is asking to much.
Rip to the workers
This problem is not only to blame one guy or another. I worked in middle east for many years.The problem lies between the host and contracting countries for the miserable conditions of these workers. Some workers are  being sent by their country who do not have any qualifications at all (nor any regulatory law to seek for their safety abroad) to work in a high risk jobs and they do not receive the appropriate training and safety conditions from their host employer...why? Money pouring into their coffers while abusing these workers.
It&#39;s disgusting. I was so mad after watching multiple disturbing documentaries on the slavery, human trafficking, kidnapping and child labor by FIFA and the world cup industries it infuriated me when a rich actor bought a team and brought it to my town. I see friends buying tickets clueless as to the wretched behavior and theft they&#39;re helping pay for. One of the most repulsive industries out there.
We’ve known this for literally months now, great to see mainstream news FINALLY COVERING THIS.
I worked in Qatar and the way these people were treated was truly disgraceful
Let&#39;s pray for all our south Asians brother s
I have no idea whatsoever, how Qatar and Russia  won world cup event from FIFA against a country like Australia. It shows how corrupt FIFA has been. Even if we forget about near guaranteed bribery activity, Australia is the only continent where the world’s biggest  event hasn’t been organized and FIFA has always had a policy to give priority to the country or continent where this event hasn’t been organized but capable of organizing. Australia is one of the very few countries that can organise any kind of sports event anytime due to its matured sports culture and presence of multiple big world class stadium in all cities.
These poor families will never get justice nor proper compensation. Poor foreign labourers are seen and treated as sub human in Qatar and in the other GCC countries. Sadly after this world cup is over in a month&#39;s time, the worker&#39;s cruel and harsh treatment will continue like before and even the world media will forget them as well.
This beautiful game is defeated by FIFA by awarding Qatar 2022.
Hi BBC, a neighbour of mine up north actually got sent to Qatar at 15 from northern Africa. They dig in the extreme hear with people dying alongside them while they worked, he then got lucky and got trafficked to Turkey where he escaped yo Greece and then France and then the UK. His story is fascinating but what&#39;s more fascinating is this is real and now he&#39;s earning more money than me here working harder than me here. A good story to tell, for sure. The significant improvements are no different from &quot;improvements&quot; 10 years ago. Qatar is run by dodgy money, the whole place is micromanagement by the ultra wealthy.
They don’t care about the works, all they care about is the money.
The dark sides that many football fans have no idea of are these. It&#39;s heart wrenching to hear such stories
<br>Id always support every petition that these other citizens from other countries are imploring, if there are.g also  in some of middle eastern countries that are struggling with their abusive boss. like those who work as a personal assistant or a housemaid some are assaulted and some receive physical injuries. 
This has been occurring for years in the UAE and Qatar. Sadly I don&#39;t think things will in these countries.
Sad story indeed. Watching all the way from Vanuatu 😥😥😥👍🇻🇺🇻🇺🇻🇺
<br>If u are drunk and unruly slightest, u will be jail for few years. extreme.
sometimes theres work place accidents in life. even in the west. its the 40 degree heat and lack of decent air conditioning and lodgings thats the real problem i have and they should get paid well for their work.
A few incidents have been blown out of proportion.... it&#39;s the WC that is annoying them, not the workers conditions.  Qatar has done everything possible to ensure the rights of workers,  but no matter what they do...  there are other issues plaguing the rest.
Rip this is painful to hear 😔
We should not respect the nations who didn&#39;t respect the common values. It&#39;s not generous, it&#39;s appeasing 🙄
Been going on in the Gulf States for decades long before Qatar was given the World Cup.
Love how everyone has developed a conscience all of a sudden. We&#39;ve known this has been going on for years just like we&#39;ve known since day one it was only awarded due to corruption so why now?
Clearly BBC forgot Qatar is a close ally of his country and big bro 🇺🇸. So nothing is gonna happen. Qatar will have a wonderful World CUp.
They are allowed to take short breaks during the workday in the heat now. Great improvements!
Yet England are still proud to play there
Even in Japan at construction sites sometimes workers are killed by accident. But not so many, like one or two. Some employers treat employees awful too, but such a thing is finally revealed. In my country it’s not easy to die so our society can’t accept death easily, no matter where people are from. Where is the humanity?
Too many people……MORE ABUSE FROM THE ONES IN POWER. BUT THE WORLD KEEPS HAVING INSANE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT CANT SUPPORT. And ironically enough the one having children are the most poor people in this world. Stop 🛑
The Du foundation made a commercial of The United Arab Emirates made of an Indonesian maid that committed suicide and was videos by it and says “if it were your pain, would you share it”.  Reminded me of this. I hope in the tournament they pay respects to these victims
...just get all the teams to fly to the closest country possible maybe like Spain and just play at local high school fields, literally anywhere else! The beautiful game should not be played on top of a graveyard!
It&#39;s a bit late for these considerations. I don&#39;t doubt these stories but if they present such a huge moral dilemma, then Qatar should never have been given the honour of hosting the World Cup in the first place.
Nothing about this World Cup is right . God bless all those who were lost and those who lost their loved ones . They should get compensation and those who were lost the family’s should as well . A good idea would be the likes of David , Gary and Neville maybe should do the right thing and donate their fees to the families directly , would save their creditability
I guess only in Qatar workers die, and in western countries in never happens 🤔. Qatar went through huge number of infrastructure ang buildings to make FIFA possible. so relatively accidents took place. No denial. It&#39;s not the government but the private subcontract companies who were run by &quot;expats&quot; are to blame. How I know? I witness this in last 6 yrs.
This is no new thing.. it&#39;s been happening throughout the middle east since long time.
If the Government of the victims are incompetent to hold Qatar and the Companies involved responsible, then the victims and their families can only expect justice and financial compensations in their dreams. <br><br>Sad state indeed...
They should pay respects in one of the matches
The problem is Qatar standards for foreign workers in need is not aligned with Human rights and they don&#39;t even realise where os the problem. They don&#39;t consider them equal human beings.
There have been quite a few documentaries about working conditions preparing the 2022 World Cup. They have said for YEARS that there has been awful working conditions. Nothing is being done. They need to compensate these families.
Many construction worker get terminated and sent home because they dont want to show any  labor in Qatar during FIFA you can check flight
Just to give an insight don’t forget to mention the workers who suffered horrific conditions building the stadium in the EU countries and South America due to accidents, sexual assaults, alcoholism incidents and rape etc. Its better to include the whole group and not exclude anyone
The most expensive grave yard of migrant workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, India. They spilled their sweat, blood even lost their lives to entertain Qatari people. The Qatar authority is abusing the workers human rights.
What a disgrace,all about money and not the workers,the hypocrisy of the football players is breathtaking.
That is the power of india citizens state in other countries even our government won&#39;t bother about us until explose in media 🤬 Worst govt of India
People should’ve brought this up ages ago when they were choosing the candidates for the WC, not after the country invested billions into stadiums and hotels and infrastructure in general 🤷‍♂️
Qatar bashing now that Qatar has stated that it may not ship gas to the EU dampening EU hopes that Qatar would help cushion the EU’s energy woes.  Coincidence?
Can the BBC come to Guyana 🇬🇾 and do this.We as construction workers have been suffering from this for the past 40 years..
And some people are only exited for the jungkook performance in the opening ceremony
FIFA should rescind awarding Qatar the World Cup events. It was proven that the FIFA board members received bribes to award Qatar.
Who even thought this was a good idea smh
As expected, what more can you expect from a strong blinded country who clearly classed everyone else’s apart from themselves as a second class citizen. Had the Qatari came out and announced that all visitors is treated as in human rights the same way as the local do you think people will still go. or in short term or long term economic support - FIFA themselves as well as the Qatari will have a chance to generate cash flow till now. Ha ha talking about respect, come on get real because only truth leave trail, and if because the majority around the world have the same mutual agreement and feels that Qatar is the wrong choice then there must be a good reason why. Do we really think people want to be talking about human rights when going to the match or being hyps up about how far the respect issue should go when visiting a country. <br>More importantly let’s hope every workers even till now and those that died to make Qatar richer get all the compensation they deserved both in moral human rights and cash from FIFA.<br><br>Let’s hope south east Asia countries have a chance to host because FIFA charges so much, estimation in South east Asia alone so far paid well over 1.2 billion£ - just to be able to get the licensing on air in watching the sport and this doesn’t even included all the 62 match.   <br>In Southeast Asia there’s only about 11 countries and less than half may be 2 or three that is a stong muslim country. (Brunei, les temor and Indonesia). Hence, as for the res like Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Philippine etc,is one of the most tourist pack destinations and homosexual, alcohol consumption isn’t banned by tradition or culture as it is a personal liberty.  So all football fan can guarantee to get a true &amp;real welcome treat that is justified which isn’t based on culture or tradition and certainly you won’t be arrested if you are a trans walking the street drunk after the match based on belief that you have ‘a damaged mind set’<br><br>It is central of the north and west Asia region that leads to the Middle East area which is strongly oppressive in human rights especially if you are from a very tradition culture background. Otherwise it will be like saying all Europe is all the same when talking about Asia and human rights.<br><br>Nevertheless having WC in Qatar will be a disaster which was predicted since the announcement 12 years ago. Though a good point that was made from the report that FIFA is no longer about football and clearly now became a very dirty rich man game. <br>Btw, the most resent update is that alcohol will now be banned 3 hours before the match unless you are in the executive box, and my heart go out to those fan who is already in Qatar and believe that everyone is welcome.
This is nothing new in that part of the world  It happens all the time on the docks When breaking down ships or anywhere building large hotels people die every day Just the same as on the railway stations and on the trains somebody dies There is no health and safety Gordon&#39;s in that part of the world  Plus if the Stafford are in it&#39;s nothing to stop the holiday micros He wished to see the World Cup I will not be in a safest place in the world  Beer background is appalling Life means nothing out there
So sad
Shame on FIFA , for awarding the World Cup host status to Qatar. Abysmal &amp; despicable,  to say the least. Reeks of the highest level of corruption &amp; human rights abuse. Pained.
God bless
whos gonna fight for them ??😒will they ever get justice😟?? the oldman whos son died has left the hope for justice also, poor people think its their fate 😔
And today the English team took a picture with few migrant workers to make things look look. What a sad sad World Cup
This is already known, and the tournament continues to feed the rich who feed from the trough...
We know all about it ... all the people from western colonies in Africa, South America, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent still feel the pain.
If countries participated happily in the Euros hosted by countries who collectively murdered millions in an illegal war in Afghanistan and Iraq then they should have zero problems here too
This is a bunch of pointless outrage.  The time to express concern was at the time of awarding the games to Qatar - labour condition were well known.  Being outraged now is like hiring a dingo as a babysitter and then being outraged when there are missing kids.
unfortunatly videos like this will not lower britich households energy bills neither rising the temperatures in winter hhhhh
Great job BBC 👏 for showing the reality.
I hope BBC keep the same energy for USA 2026
Relatively little comment about Iran &amp; Saudi playing in the comp, I notice. Hardly bastions of civil liberty.
It’s a shame that BBC is still throwing its venom against sports. It was their stupidity at the time of the bidding that Britain lost this opportunity to host this world cup 2022. Also it is struggling with it’s economy, poverty, dirty politics and post Brexit issues that it is in no position to host this cup in the next 40-50 years.
Why a week before the World Cup starts are you highlighting this situation you’ve had 12 years to stop this tournament happening in Qatar it’s disgraceful qatar are hosting the World Cup thanks to Sepp Blatter 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
The criminals must be accountable for whatever took place there for those lives lost, more questions to be answered. Trillion Kingdom can&#39;t even protect foreign workers
He know his work is dangerous also. Any big projects the workers might get hurt and everyone know that  you just loves drama
All contries need to leave Fifa- modern day slavery is evil
Around 6500 died that&#39;s shocking like genocide,  how is this real it&#39;s mind blowing.........
Yes over 6,500 migrant workers have died making the stadiums
Dubai is a slavery place, that&#39;s why people got so rich.<br>Until you go see it, talk to the workers and locals, you won&#39;t know.
US and Europe should bring all those migrant workers from middle East to their country and give them visa and work
What about Narendra Modi? There is no protest from the Indian government against the treatment of these workers. Does he accept the death of his fellow countrymen?<br>There are more protests from Western countries and governments against working conditions in Qatar.
Football teams should refuse to play, not like they can&#39;t afford to unlike these literally poor workers
Knew a few guys went to Australia about 10 years ago <br>Ended up they were working on a farm <br>They wernt long coming back home
It was honestly the worst place to hold the word cup
Here for the Qatar-stans when they accuse the UK of hypocrisy for the sins they committed decades ago.
Finally covered this, too late the stadium already been built and the people have died
I hope BBC will also talk and boycott the 2026 fifa which is in US. US the biggest criminal of all time✌️✌️✌️
Shame on Qatar !!
So many countries with existing stadiums and without stone age, archaic rules and human rights violations. Bad call for them to host it. Fyre festival 2.0 but far far worse
👍
It is always melanated people who suffer at the expense of the system.
Qatar goverment they have clear safety rules and regulation but some company they are not following the safety procedure during their construction. every where some people are like that they spoiling country name also.<br>I love Qatar ❤️❣️
Hypocrites, everyone knew that years ago.
Are the BBC showing the games.?
serial exploiters of workers!!😡😡they don&#39;t even deserve the bottle championship
Mind Begs the Question:<br>To Support and Aid an Apartheid State<br>Righteous,Evil?
But the BBC is still covering the World Cup, I suppose all that money makes things better.
People they treated like slave but the wages is poor🤦‍♀️
is someone going to ask the question.. why are people so desperate to go and work in such circumstances... one word.... population explosion... not enough jobs and opportunity for the new young in their own countries,,,,
The awarded contractors for these projects need to be forced a mandatory Health and Safety Training and mandatory audits and guidelines on their labor camps.
Iam just 😭
☹️☹️☹️
Whatever Katar tried to achieve, it did not work out.
