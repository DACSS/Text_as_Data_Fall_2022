Qatar has been unfairly scrutinized for the World Cup 2022. Are they perfect as a country no is there any country that is perfect? easy answer no but everyone is paying attention to them all of a sudden.  There are more plus sides to Qatar then negative that i can assure anyone who reads this.  Qatar is welcoming the people are welcoming they have a religion and a culture respect it when visiting and they will respect you.  The efforts that have been put into this World Cup are simply put phenomenal - is it different to other World Cups every World Cup brings something different.  Maybe support them as opposed to continuous attacks - support can mean change.
I understand the people saying you have to respect the culture of the country your visiting, but when part of the culture is infringing human rights thats when it&#39;s gone to far and people should protest it.
You really shouldn&#39;t be asking about religion and Christians being racist in the World Cup stop playing the race card on people just be happy that we get to see a up in coming wealthy country prosper sure some human rights violations did happen but people really want a country who is small to exceed western countries expectations for more press respect people and you will be respected that simple not always about racism and religion although there is going to be a major problem forever with the country being rigged the world cup by big money FIFA employees some things just can&#39;t be changed unfortunately.
‚ù§Ô∏è Qatar
You get these toothless guys talking about safety and respect while they chace each other with knives and swordsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
sky are fake..they go overboard with the racism and inclusion because at heart they are the racists..their owners are the racists. they scourer through social media to find one racist comment and make it headline news
Funny the comments saying respect their culture etc, but if they come to the west and the people have an issue with the religion or culture they are ignorant racist, talk about a double standard
Why can&#39;t such fans just watch games like normal fans instead of openly displaying their sexuality everywhere?
when you let them practice sharia law in your country, they will let you practice LGBTQ+ in their country LOL
This is the new form of western colonialism. The west, and Europe in particular think that they are the morally superior race and want to impose it on the rest of the world. No different than what they did in Africa a century ago.
My gosh, gay just want the world to bow to them
I&#39;m 100% with the gay community etc etc but yeah I just think respect this countries laws. I&#39;m a straight man who respects anyone and everyone no matter what they believe in but when it comes to this argument just respect there laws. I mean when a Muslim family moves to the uk what is one of the first things we say to them? Learn our language and respect our laws. Why should it be any different over there?
The comments (as usual) are very encouraging. No homophobic comments but acceptance of another culture. I suspect the very loud, very angry minority of activists will cause trouble and damage their own cause still further.
I&#39;m all for having to adhere to the customs of the country you&#39;re visiting but Qatar shouldn&#39;t be allowed to host such an international event if it can&#39;t accept people coming to this event that have different beliefs from them. Discrimination has no place in sport.
Finally a bit of common sense. When you are visiting are different country RESPECT THEIR LAWS! Y&#39;all aint in your own country no more and you need to understand that. All Qatar is saying is &#39;respect our laws&#39; absolutely 100% agree with that statement. This whole fiasco surrounding the world cup is becoming an agenda with political motivations to undermine Qatar and the World Cup
You can‚Äôt respect a country that goes against equal/human rights! I get respecting culture BUT‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt respect laws like that.
‚ÄúJust focus on the football‚Äù‚Ä¶ NO!
So when Russia hold worldcup 2018 knowing Russia isn&#39;t democracy state everyone was quite but when Qatar holds worldcup everyone is talking. That is called racism
The English and their cultural superiority thinking they can go to another country, another faith, another people and demand that their customs and culture is overturned because they say so. Good job England.
Do you know how to make a cake?<br><br>yes. Everybody knows how to make cake<br><br>then explain.<br><br>ok‚Ä¶ first you get cake, then you make it.
Just celebrate our differences this world has enough hate/problems already ‚ù§
Respect for the culture, he‚Äôs a joke. How can everyone be welcome. He is also full of rubbish because you see men holding hands in arabic culture in any case. Poor answers from that man and no reassurance given
Welcome at the tournament but not in the country.
Qatar hosting migrant workers death show and call it FIFA World üòÖ and name it pro LGBTQ wow so progressive
Why teams like England always have to be the Karens in sports?<br>Also how many times this is gonna ask the same question‚Ä¶‚Ä¶are the queers gonna be ok in Qatar? üôÑ
The most empty words ever lol
Ok I get if you go to another country you should respect the laws and culture but most countries just have one set of laws for everyone that lives and travels there and people travel there for the culture. it&#39;s a bit confusing when travelers are treated differently to the actual people that were born there. does that mean that if any females go they have to go with a male as that&#39;s the law? Or is it one rule for them one rule for us? If 2 females show up will they be allowed in or turned away and what if those females hold hands? because that would be breaking there laws. This is what I mean, in Europe if you break the law no matter who or where your from you will be punished according to the country your in, its simple, German people don&#39;t have to follow different laws to travelers, nor in England, France, etc the laws are just the laws not bound by religion. I mean the country looks really nice, clean, beautiful but I just don&#39;t know how I can follow the rules when there own people have different ones. It is a bit odd not to mention the massive cost to go and now slavery to build it? I understand the argument but it&#39;s still a bit odd and I think they need to put out more information about what the laws are for travelers, is it the whole country or just near the football stadium? If we go out in to the public area to immerse yourself in the culture, do the rules change for travelers? This is why it&#39;s confusing you can say everyone is welcome and believe it to be true but the laws of there own land say that some types of people are basically breaking the law by being who they are. If anyone can explain this to me so it makes sense I would appreciate it I have tried to look up other countries that have laws for travels that differ to the actual laws of the country and can&#39;t find any, other than America which has different laws depending on which state your in. But at least we won&#39;t see loads of drunk fans all over the TV embarrassing there respective countries, as being drunk in public is against the law as well as public nudity of any kind so that is a bonus, unless that law does not apply to travelers. This is what I found about traveling to Qatar:<br>The local laws and customs reflect the fact that Qatar is an Islamic country. You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or if you intend to visit religious areas. There may also be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in Europe but is in Qatar ‚Äì for example giving somebody a cheque which bounces.<br>it is an offence to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. Travellers have been detained under this law,  For example, drinking in a public place could result in a prison sentence of up to 6 months and/or a fine up to QAR3,000. Alcohol is available only at licensed hotel restaurants and bars, and expatriates living in Qatar can obtain alcohol on a permit system.  <br>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when filming or photographing people and religious, military or construction sites. Some visitors attempting to film or photograph in sensitive areas have been arrested. If in doubt, seek permission.<br>There are strict privacy laws in Qatar. Posting material (including videos and photographs) online that appear to insult, slander or are culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime punishable under Qatari law. Individuals have been detained, prosecuted and/or convicted for posting this type of material<br>You should dress modestly when in public, including while driving. Women must cover their shoulders and avoid wearing short skirts. Both men and women are advised not to wear shorts or t-shirts when going to government buildings, health care facilities or malls or public areas. If you do not dress modestly, you may be asked to leave or be denied entry to locations.<br>Any intimacy for example kissing, holding hands and hugging in public between men and women (including between teenagers) can lead to arrest.<br>Homosexual behaviour is illegal in Qatar.<br>So with that I hope someone can explain why there will be a different set of rules for travelers and not local people and how far do the different rules apply is it the whole of Qatar or just in and around the stadium.
No thank you.  My friend who lives in qatar told me that police have been instructed that people are not allowed to celebrate to much on the streets‚Ä¶I love WC but this one I will not travel to and I have attended 3 live finals.
This will be a very grubby World Cup. I know many who usually follow with glee, but will ignore this one.<br>D Beckham has gribboed himself too, with his fatuous videos... &quot;This is one of my favourite spice markets&quot;.  I grow spices and I don&#39;t have a list of favourite spice markets.  Grubby.
Bro wtf dude we‚Äôre Muslim and I am from Syria but for the World Cup dude what in the hell is this
Ruined it
I‚Äôm a Christian and I really respect that man. If you choose to go Qatar, you respect their culture. It‚Äôs pretty simple to me
It‚Äôs just not worth the risk
<br>It is very difficult for a Westerner to see an Easterner succeed (especially if he is an Arab Muslim).
Lmao what about the LGBT Qataris who go play in the desert
<br>Try to find logic in that.ership...not themselves... They blame the countries in which they are HAPPY! And they want to change the countries in which they&#39;re happy, to be like the countries they came from, where they were unhappy.
Homosexual people wouldn‚Äôt let homophobic people into their home so that being said a country which doesn‚Äôt tolerate homosexuality is allowing you into their country to watch the World Cup just be happy to go or don‚Äôt go very simple
I do not know why some of Western people or LGPT want to impose their culture on a country that is not their country.  As a Muslim, when I go to any Western country, I respect their culture, and I cannot impose my culture or religious teachings on them, also the world cup includes different cultures and religions, and everyone must respect the other
Just go there, watch the match peacefully and express your intimate toward your partner at the place your staying away from people.<br><br>Why is this so hard to understand ???
Alphabet community this isn&#39;t about you. Stop mixing politics and sports together.
The crying from the alphabet community is funny and pathetic. They are the most entitled power hungry whining babies I&#39;ve seen in my life. Their land Their rules.
LGBTQ is inadequate firstly, keep your views to your selfs and respect views of Middle eastern countries. Especially when they(LGBT) are trynna &#39;target our childrens.&#39; With that kind of attitude its imperative that we refrain from the intrinsic morals. Perhaps flow with the Human nature and instinct
Its very simple!<br>You come to one of 50 OIC nations? RESPECT THE CULTURE AND LAWS. IF YOUR SO ENTITLED THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN COME THEN IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN MADE UP LAWS AS IF YOU OWN THE LAND WE ARE GOING TO TREAT YOU HOW WHITE SUPREMACIST SHOULD BE TREATED!!<br><br>Lgbtqi armbands are FORBIDDEN as they are:<br>1. Anti islamic.<br>2. A show of politics which is forbidden by the FIFA itself (even though Ukrainian flags were allowed but Palestinian ones not).<br><br>If you carry a lgbtqi flag that will be taken as a direct insult against muslims and even an act of war.<br><br>You will spend your stay in jail until the game is over then be deported after your cheecks have been smacked and your brain has been turned on again.
simple answer <br>u r coming to enjoy football not to held proud march and enjoy hot bedüòÇü§£
hypocrisy and audacity of western civilization is unbelievable
The people inside Iran demand from the Qatar World Cup Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to remove the Iranian national team with the hated flag of the regime

&#39;Respectful to the culture &quot;<br>Hotels refusing bookings to gay couples.
How hard is it to keep in the bedroom?  why do they have to shove their sexuality down everyone&#39;s necks?
Why don‚Äôt you just respect other peoples cultures ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Disrespecting the culture of Qatar this is a disgraceful act of uceaf should respect the Qatar religion and culture.
‚ÄúAnyone can say only few can do what they say‚Äù Moses
Respect others people laws , nobody has problem with someone being L.....B is his or her choice, what we are against is don&#39;t come and try to force your thing on our people . Do your thing without involving others .
no wonder why putin does not like the west
I just dont get it...why should Quatar change its rules on Gays....its their country ...its their rules .
&quot;(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves,refer it to Allah/Creator and His Messenger{pbuh},if you believe in Allah/Creator and in the Last Day.That is better and more suitable for final determination.&quot;<br>              Holy Quran (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UehxGD04Y2U&amp;t=4m59s">4:59</a>)
I love Qatar more for this. Everybody should be welcomed and be safe ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è welcome Qatar you are now a first world country ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes mr, it is racism, it is hate to see others especially Arabs and Muslims<br>Doing something positive. They don‚Äôt want that, they want to keep telling their sheep population that their miserable lives are better
I can definitely see people getting arrested in Qatar, 100%
Wouldn&#39;t trust it all the way
Boycott Qatar World Cup
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ don&#39;t trick the alphabet community
Wokeism at its finest

Didn&#39;t know the &quot;alphabet&quot; community is into football!
WOW just focus on football not the politics jeez.
There will some interesting stories during this World Cup.  And then there will be the football as well.
West needs to understand you can‚Äôt force your values and morality on rest of the world each nation has their own culture and morality
this is a World Cup, not a Western Cup, every country has its own laws and cultures, respect them especially when u are visiting..
this is going to be interesting ü§î
England should take Welbeck the man is on form
these LGBT.... fellas thinking they run the world
And what about those LGBTQ+ people already living in the country?
Boycott
Rich coming from a network that hurls racial discriminatory hate against a Premier League Legend like Salah for being Arab<br>Contrast the scrutiny Salah faces compared to that which Kane faces when Salah has consistently produced more Goals and Assists than the latter throughout his time in England
It‚Äôs false . I‚Äôve lived here for 20 years I‚Äôm from the uk . Women can come family are welcome nobody is going to get in trouble for anything . I drink everyday . My girlfriend is British she wears what she wants but she chooses to be more conservative to respect others but you can wear anything and not get in trouble . Same rule applied to my mother . Drinking is allowed in special areas like bars hotels and restaurants that allow it which is alot . The culture and religion doesn‚Äôt want you drunk in the streets that‚Äôs why we have low crime rate here and it‚Äôs voted safest country in the world
The payment for migrant workers is disgusting. In one of the most expensive regions in the world. Supporters of Qatar go one about inclusivity, where‚Äôs their inclusivity for other cultures? Treating Asian people like slaves, treating gay people like criminals, treating western women like slabs of meat. Any Middle Eastern person that goes to most European nations can express their culture in anyway they please. Which is how it should be everywhere. If a country is not inclusive they should not host a major tournament.
Lol üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
RESPECT THE CULTURE! RESPECT THE COUNTRY YOU ARE IN! AS SIMPLE AS THAT!
Respect the culture of a country you are VISITING IN.
It‚Äôs all wrong‚Ä¶..No politics or LGBT stuff,  means No silly woke rainbow arm bands‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs pathetic!!!. <br>It‚Äôs a football competition Kane and Bale etc need to focus on why they are there!!!
World is trying to impose homosexuality on us. <br><br>Don‚Äôt try force people to accept gays.
They also need respect the man‚Äôs religious beliefs.  Stop trying put pressure on him on live tv
Qatar is a tiny country and the Qatari people are minorities in their own country. All this hate against them sound like bullying.
