Looking forward to it if you just act normal respect the culture and country and you will be ok.  No one needs to know someone is gay just like no one needs to know if you hetero.  Just save that for behind closed doors and make sure it&#39;s between consenting adults.  Children and animals are not consenting adults btw you perverts.
Honestly every country in the world has done bad. May Allah bless these workers who have done so much for the country. However to call it slavery is too far. They r not taking them without there will, like when British and Americans killed and took thousands of slaves. They come here for better options. Of course it can be better however it is much better than what was happening to them in their own countries.
if you don't like it stay home and the last people talking about human rights is the west.
So we can’t boycott a football game ( a trivial matter)  to protest a repressive homophobic regime. But we can boycott Russian gas ( an essential commodity to keep us all warm) to protest a repressive homophobic regime? neo liberal values in a nutshell.
I see everyone kept their mouth shut with Russia&#39;s world cup
Did Qatar invade any country and kill millions? Who are robbing Africa? Western hypocrisy has no limit.
They are treated unfairly so they had to bribe only to be called corrupt
If this was Russia most teams would have pulled out!
Can&#39;t help think the tone of this report would have been different if it was Russia being accused of human rights violation!
These pigs are paying lot of liberals in western countries and funding many media orgs
As a Muslim, I am proud that the World Cup is being hosted in a Muslim country. The West has an agenda against Muslim nations, that is why they attack Qatar. Where were these cries for &quot;human rights&quot; when Russia hosted the world cup?<br><br>No one objected to Brazil or South Africa hosting the world cup despite most of their population starving?<br><br>The most criminal countries such as America, England and France have also hosted the world cup. These are govenrments who wiped out thousands of innocent people in Muslim countries with their drone strikes.<br><br>Why didn&#39;t anyone speak out against them hosting the world cup?
So America wasn&#39;t corrupt?
It is about soccer. Not LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 <br>They shouldn’t make every event about lgbtq
well................
Just respect other countries laws and beliefs.
selective morality, israel is invited to eurovision and european championships but they want us to be upset about qatar, hypocrite 🙄🙄
Well hope  qp kp  ero  3 code  <br>Income  you I&#39;m  3 layar <br>Qp   KP   <i>ERO EEE</i><br>YOU I&#39;M AZ ORGANIZATION
An apology won’t bring those dead labour  back alive
When is the west going to respecting other countries without pushing their agenda, I mean we all know this ain’t about the workers sharing rooms or the stadium being moveable ( it’s about the west pushing so called LGBQT) no wonder why only the west condemned Russia and the world didn’t
Shame on qatar killing 100000 workers
Good job Qatar 🇶🇦 don’t let other countries bully you 😎👍❤️
Arab using western accent .......he even hates hiz own culture 😂😂
why don&#39;t the rich arab take ther middeleast people to Labour  .. same culture..
Better stay with family watch in big projector drink party freely enjoy football who want to die or put life on risk .... Qatar is not a place for travel party enjoy football No way love my life
The bloody absurd thing is, why would you give a hosting right to a nation with an appalling human rights record, that haven&#39;t even qualified to the World Cup since the beginning of the time prior to this? They bloody bought it for goodness&#39; sake. They don&#39;t have sufficient amount of stadiums capable of hosting before they got the rights. Just for the sake of diversity (which is surely not)? Or money? They only have three hundred thousand native population there. These w⚓s of FIFA.
I cannot understand why this is still going on. Many countries are unable to accept that the world cup is going to happen. There have been investigations regarding this topic and nothing major was found to cancel the tournament. It is getting ridiculous now, accept the fact that it happening. Countries should look at themselves, make their countries better and then focus on other countries. Many people won&#39;t like about what I am going to say but they( countries) are also not happy bcoz Qatar is going to earn a lot of money due to the world cup.
shouldn&#39;t hold major tournaments in Muslim country&#39;s... they will and have sucked the fun out of football ... I for one won&#39;t be watching a single game... can&#39;t have sex... can&#39;t drink or take drugs ... how shit is this world cup going to be
Boycotting it because of:<br><br>1. It&#39;s hosted in an arab country<br>2. Stadiums built by slave workers<br>3. American butthurt <br><br>It is either us or the americans
Qutar world cup will flop
People talking about Qatar bribing FIFA forget that in 1990s USA hosted the world cup. USA will host again next world cup. This is in a country where  Football is not a major sport and is played by kids and women. How do you think US got to host it? 😂😂😂😂😂
UAE has even worse working conditions. However, its a hub for Western tourists and workers who earn much much more than South Asians. But they NEVER complain for receiving higher wages than other non-whites. HYPOCRITES.😂
Western hypocrisy and double standards. How about the treatment of millions of Mexican and other migrants in the US? They are exploited for cheap labor. Nobody in the West criticizes USA for hosting anything. Western HYPOCRISTES.
Fertilizer I am a Qatari expatriate. There are many workers in Qatar who work for 6/7 years. They work for the old wages. The company does not increase their wages. Many people have been able to change their jobs and have benefited a lot from the introduction of government without noc system. If the Qatari government had given the opportunity to the workers who have been working in Qatar for more than 5 years to change the kafala without noc, the workers in Qatar would have benefited a lot.
Radical Country n Radical People
Will one be taking the knee in a country that presently still uses slaves?
One day the Qatar should pay for this cruality.. damm sure.
Im. Sick anf tiered or the human flag BS. China has. Many Human Rights issues and what happend to them or Russia or anyone else? Nothing. So please stop with tye Human rights BS
Go Qatar.
Qatar has my support.
Liberals and lgbtq s are degrading Qatar. But Qatar will Doing there Job🔥🔥
Homosexuality is rampant in Qatar.
Mrs Sofia is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy
Qatar has murdered 7,000 African slaves in hard labor in order to build the stadiums for the World Cup and people want to celebrate on their own blood.  How can it be that a rich country like Qatar with the highest GDP in the world does not pay its slaves and forcibly enslave them to the death of 7000 people just for sports.  This World Cup must be boycotted.

Yeah, Why apologise for Human rights violations, Oppression of LGBTQ and minorties etc etc when you can pay for such defensive PR and silence any Athlet by stuffing money in thier mouths....<br>Anyone who takes part in this Game should not be allowed to speak of Human rights ever again. Shame on these people
I dont see you guys talking about the people who died in Russia due to the buildings.. were the TV News such as BBC paid not to do so? Just interested
Lived in qatar, they are very nice to and treat europeans and americans well. After all like in bibilical egypt these westerners have a role to play as slave- drivers as they work as top level managers and directors in qatari companies, in exchange for tax-free salaries and lots of perks. However, pity to you as an asian or african working as labourer, they treat you like crap. Oh yeah some qatari people are nice but generally rarely interact or socialize with foreigners apart from at work.  It is &quot;apartheid reloaded&quot; in these rich gulf countries of kuwait, oman, bahrain, saudi and UAE . If only all leaders in so called 3rd world countries were incorruptable and made policies to ensure all their countrymen have better lives, these desperate people would not trade their bodies and labour for a peasant salary. They come there with illusion of a better life, but some die and many others repatriate home sad, emotionally scarred and in deep regret. God have mercy on the disadvantaged and exploited people. Money buys &quot;truth&quot;, hahaha ask aljazeraa. I have met this man and some of his ilk for a photo op as they sanitized their image in the world, i could write a book. But then again arab money through foreign investment vehicles is running europe and america. No escape from capitalism for most of us. God have mercy on us. No justice in this world.
Sir mera company me fibravary salary only 28 days dheray full salary not giving Agen spost day salary cutting  you know eni help
Their families should be caught and be forced to work at the same conditions that they have been putting workers from other countries.
a country that has modern day slavery, human rights abuses, sharia law which is extremely discriminatory to women and people of any other religion other than Islam and Christianity, one of the highest death rates of workers, yet it&#39;s okay to play football there, amazing isn&#39;t it, people say money can&#39;t buy you everything, show them this shitshow
The tea will come out after its done
Another glorious moment for the islamic world...
Wonder how much money received from Qatar to make this interview.
Slavery is common in middle East specially arabia
Homosexuality is not something to be proud of
The last World Cup was in Russia &amp; the criticism wasn’t 1/2 as much as Qatar. Also none of you actually care about South Asian migrant workers we’ve seen how non-European refugees and migrants are treated. It’s all a farce based on (I suspect) that of annoyance that a non-European country is willing/able to outcompete them for national prestige.
Its the death knell of football for the man in the street, competitions like this now out of reach for the majority, just a spectical for the very rich. FIFA, like the FA is run by little more than football oilgarchs.
At least no kneeling bullshit and just football
The Arabs treatment of people who are not Arabs or White in color is absolutely awfull.
This Arabic nation is little humanitarian concepts among workers , especially  home maid workers conditions are very brutal no human rights and laws. like fisherman attitude.
Stop imposing your values on to others because you would not like others forcing their values on to you.<br>Homosexuality is illegal in Islam, Christianity and Judaism, it is God&#39;s will.<br>You can&#39;t ask people to change their religion, that is a red line.<br><br>Homosexuality is wrong any way because scientifically speaking sex is for procreation.<br>Male reproductive parts should go in female reproductive parts.
Despite government reforms, migrant workers continued to face labour abuses and struggled to change jobs freely. Curtailment of freedom of expression increased in the run-up to FIFA World Cup 2022. Women and LGBTI people continued to face discrimination in law and practice<br><br>The Gulf diplomatic crisis that started in 2017, pitting Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt against Qatar, ended in January.<br><br>In July, the emir ratified a law paving the way for the first legislative elections of the Shura Council (Consultative Assembly) to elect 30 of its 45 members. However, the law excluded Qataris whose grandfathers were not born in Qatar from voting or standing for election on the basis of the discriminatory nationality law. The election was held on 2 October.

In December, the government reported that 242,870 migrant workers had been able to change jobs following the reforms in September 2020; however, it did not report how many workers managed to do so without securing the permission of their employer – information that is key to measuring progress.<br><br>The situation remained even more difficult for live-in women domestic workers on account of their isolation in their employer’s house, which is also their workplace.<br><br>The system continued to yield powers to employers who oversee the entry and residence of migrant workers in Qatar, enabling abusive employers to cancel residency permits or file cases accusing their employee of absconding, jeopardizing migrant workers’ legal presence in the country.

Qatar is also a very good friend with russia. russians dont need visa to go there......and i guess it is clear now who stands behind bribes as well as  gives you a hint why qatar is going to host world cup
They should only be apologetic to their own country&#39;s people for being the only country ever to qualify World Cup the first time by being the host. What a shame to be a football fan in Qatar

For example, according to Deagel, the population of France will increase from 67 million inhabitants in 2017 to 39 million in 2025, that of England will increase from 66 million to 15 million, that of Australia from 23 million to 15 million. , that of Germany from 81 million to 28 million, while the population of Canada will grow from 36 million in 2017 to 26 million in 2025. (China, Russia, and the rest of the communist countries population, don&#39;t get touched.)<br><br>Deagel&#39;s reports, particularly the aforementioned research on North Korea, were also provided to the president during presidential briefings. Deagel thus provides information which is then used by global intelligence communities and governments. Here is a partial list of known Deagel partners and customers, according to their own websites: National Security Agency, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Defense Procurement Agency, Stratfor, the World Bank and the United Nations.&quot;<br><br>Luke 21:36<br>“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man!”<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/oyhFHyuDHMA">https://youtu.be/oyhFHyuDHMA</a>
