<p>I specifically focused on Amazon reviews. I wish to perform a Sentiment Analysis on reviews related to the best selling book series in Amazon by different customers. In the first part, I wish to collect reviews related to these books (Web scraping) and prepare the data.</p>
<p>In the next part, I wish to conduct a social network analysis and visualize the underlying emotions (sentiments) of the reviews.</p>

As such, I've read many fantasy novels over the years...and doing so has made me notice a rather unfortunate trend: the genre as a whole often relies too heavily on the same cliches and plots, which makes many of the stories presented seem tired, predictable, and overdone.  As a result of this, I decided to take a break from fantasy; one can only read the same story so many times before getting fed up.  I started \"A Game of Thrones\" very tentatively, partially because of the all the hype around the series and partially due to my own wariness regarding fantasy novels.  My fears were completely unfounded; \"A Game of Thrones\" is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and is easily one of the best books I've read in recent years.  Spoilers follow. The novel contains three story lines.  The first and most heavily focused on is that of the Kingdom of Westeros, its political structure, the ruling family's potentially reputation-destroying secret, and the beginning of conflict after the king dies.  The second plot is that of the Wall and the constant struggle of the Night Watch to defend Westeros against the wildlings and more sinister creatures that reside beyond the Kingdom's border.  The third takes place away from Westeros and follows the story of Daenerys, the last of the Targaryen family, and the start of her rise to power.  The first story is clearly the main plot, while the second and third receive a little less attention, yet are no less important to the overall story. The story presented here isn't that which is typically found in your common fantasy fare.  This is not a tale of sword and sorcery, wizards and heroes enacting the traditional yarn of Good versus Evil, or of an impoverished farm boy discovering that he comes from a lofty background and is destined for greatness.  Instead, this is largely about politics and political intrigue with a dash of magic and the unknown thrown in to give the novel a unique flavour.  Perhaps the most noticeable element of the plot when compared to other fantasy books is the lack of magic; it does exist in Martin's world and he indicates that it can be a very powerful force, yet its role in this particular book is very small.  This makes the few instances where it does appear very significant.  Martin has said that he based \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" on the War of the Roses, and as such, more attention is given to the politics and the crisis of succession when Westeros' king dies.  This makes for a story that avoids the traditional fantasy cliches while still having a distinctly fantasy feel. The primary focus may be on political intrigue, but the book is hardly boring or overly mired solely in scheming.  With all this political conflict come battles, fights, beheadings, and conquest, and Martin writes all of them exceedingly well and believably.  This is a very gritty world that Martin has created, and he certainly doesn't shy away from showing how brutal life can be for his characters.  Both rape and violence are present and are portrayed in a much blunter, starker light than in most novels.  If there is a battle, you will see characters suffer gruesome ends, and the spoils of conquest are not glossed over.  Yet, the use of such elements doesn't come off as gratuitous nor do they seem unnecessary; instead, they serve to characterize the world in which the characters go about their lives.  Indeed, this is a dangerous place with far-reaching consequences and risks.  It certainly puts a darker spin on the plot, but as someone who quickly bores of overly optimistic characters and stories, this darker, grittier fantasy very much appeals to me and gives the book a certain edge that sets it apart from others. Accompanying this dangerous, sometimes terrifying world is the idea that no one is safe...and that includes main characters.  Martin doesn't hesitate to take characters you've grown close to throughout the book and run them through the wringer, sometimes going as far as to kill them off.  One of the main point of view characters is beheaded toward the end of the book, not because he is a terrible person or because he is in some way marked as being a \"bad\" character.  On the contrary, he's the most honest, reasonable character in the book, and it's his own honesty that leads to his demise.  This is the point that makes you realize that \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" will pull no punches or give anyone immunity based solely on whether they are a positive or negative character, a primary character or a background character.  When characters, regardless of their role in the story, enter into a conflict, whether it's physical in the form of a fight or battle or more complicated through scheming and deceit, you genuinely fear for their safety.  While the traditional fantasy novel may put the main character through trials and hardships, you know he'll make it through in the end, but that's not the case here.  The reader is always on edge, worrying for their favourite characters or rooting for the demise of their most hated, but you never know how it's really going to play out.  It's a completely different reading experience from most books out there, putting a real sense of danger into the book's events and a feeling of suspense into the story. Another standout aspect of \"A Game of Thrones\" is the world building.  Martin has not only created an intriguing world of politics, kings, deceit, battles, conquest, magic, and gritty reality, he has done it in a masterful manner.  It's become something of a pet peeve of mine when authors are so proud of the world they've built that they dump pages and pages of their world's landscape, history, government, culture, etc on the reader in the middle of the story; it's a heavy-handed, clunky way of developing the backdrop of a novel.  Martin manages to keep his world richly detailed while avoiding info-dumping by slipping in brief descriptions of how Westeros works in dialogue or when the subject in question appears.  He doesn't appear to be in a hurry to reveal everything and instead lets things unfold in their own time.  He knows his world from front to back, and he knows when it is appropriate to explain something and when it isn't. The character setup of \"A Game of Thrones\" is also pretty different.  Instead of having one protagonist whose story is the focus of the book, we get 8 different characters that provide 8 unique points of view.  The perspective switches in every chapter, so we often see one event thoroughly told from two or three different characters.  This is a great way to keep the story from getting stale or repetitive, as all of the characters have a distinct voice or bias and no character ever receives two chapters back to back.  On the downside, however, it can be a little frustrating to be enjoying the perspective of one character, only to turn the page and see that you'll be finishing the issue at hand through the eyes of a different figure.  That aside, having 8 point of view characters works very well for the novel because it keeps each chapter fresh and allows the reader to thoroughly get to know multiple characters rather than just one. What is particularly great about Martin's characters is, as I said above, that they're completely distinct.  They're so well fleshed out and have so many realistic motivations, feelings, and actions that it could be easy to forget that they are fictional characters rather than real people.  While some characters may seem to fall into a broad archetype of character, pretty much none of the characters can be summed up on one or two words.  Equally as impressive, whether you'll like or dislike a character will be dependent on how well they or part of their personality resonates with you personally, instead of whether they are \"good\" or \"bad.\"  Even the characters that seem to be cast in a more negative light have positive personality traits that make them likable and relatable.  It also seems that what one reader appreciates about one character, another reader may dislike.  The characters in \"Game of Thrones\" are so well fleshed out and realized that they sometimes seem as realistic as flesh-and-blood people, and like real people, your reactions to and liking of the characters will be based almost entirely on their complex personalities. The secondary and side characters also receive a lot of care.  Although we don't get to know them as intimately as the point of view characters, we still often see enough of them to get a sense of who they are.  There are a lot of side characters in the novel, with possibly hundreds of names being tossed around depending on whose point of view the chapter is told through...so you do have to pay attention to who is who.  Most characters, however, appear fairly frequently and are distinct enough that it's easy to keep them straight.  And those who aren't seen as often tend to come with a little reminder of who they are when they do show up.  Even though there are a lot of secondary and side characters, they are given a lot of thought, making for a rich variety of figures to populate the novel's setting. To reiterate what I mentioned earlier, no one is safe.  This can make for some emotional reading when the characters are so unique and well thought out.  It must always be remembered that anything can happen to the characters and any chapter could be their last.  Characters can meet their end very quickly or very slowly, and there's really no way of predicting if a figure will survive or not. As a side note, despite the length of \"A Game of Thrones,\" it is only the first book of a long series.  This means that while this novel contains its own well-told story, it also does a lot of setting up for the overarching plot and leaves more questions than it answers at its conclusion.  If you begin to read this series, you will likely become hooked on it and rush out to get the second book after you finish this one. Overall, \"A Game of Thrones\" is one of the best books I've read in recent years.  It bucks the trends and cliches of modern fantasy novels and offers up something that is unique, but still contains the mystical flavour of the genre.  The world presented is violent and gritty with a no-one-is-safe policy that leads for some edgy, often tense reading.  The characters are wonderfully developed and fleshed out so well that they could easily be real people, and the different points of view throughout the novel offer unique perspectives on the story's events.  This is perhaps the first book I've read in a long time about which I can't come up with something I don't like, aside from a couple characters...but, as I said earlier, not liking certain characters for aspects of their complex personalities is part of what makes the novel so, well, likeable.  Five stars happily given for the above and for reviving my interest in fantasy.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Well plotted and paced; excellent, fresh fantasy tale\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won't like this series:  WHY TO READ GRRM  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the  villain, is stupid or not too bright.  (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND  DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has  the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.  Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if  you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in  the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly,  GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He  purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.  (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are  long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces;  something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten  suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we  sometimes get different opinions.  (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is  your guy. Almost flawless flow.  (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between  characters through threats and intrigue.  (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each  character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story  continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why  each novel is between 700-900 pages.  (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical  archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are  totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of  characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book  three.  (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we  can't understand it but well done.  (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on  that.  (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits;  GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.  (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male  author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think,  too.  (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so  heroes can't get out of jams with it.  REASON TO NOT READ GRRM  (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good  job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't  your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so  be warned.  (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like  more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or  Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with  strong archetypes.  (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer  that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for  you.  (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in  real life.  (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK:  this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some  have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.  (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can  be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to  make anyone necessarily good or evil.  (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's  comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE  RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're  this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the  exception of one or two characters.  (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that  case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.  (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of  power (one female exception). ....\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Compelling and Riveting!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am writing this review as an individual who watched Game of Thrones on HBO before picking up the book series, so with that in mind you may or may not find my review helpful/useful. I will also try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.As a fan of the tv series, I came into this book knowing what to expect; I was told that Season 1 and Book 1 are very similar, and that is most certainly true. But do you know what? I still loved the book. I’ll do list format for the book’s good and bad points (in my opinion and in no particular order) to make this a little more organized.--GOODS:DIALOGUE/WRITING - George RR Martin has a way with words. His descriptions of the various locations and lands and kingdoms of Westeros, from Winterfell to King’s Landing to Vaes Dothrak, have flawless flow. I love descriptive writing, and there is always a fine line between not describing something enough to give the reader a good picture and going overboard to the point where it gets boring to read through paragraphs of superfluous text. This is especially true in the fantasy genre, where the lands and people and words and customs are all…well, fantastical. This book finds that balance, with evocative, beautiful language that puts you right in that setting and right in the thick of the action. Hell, the descriptions of food always made me hungry even if they were serving something that I would never actually eat! As for the dialogue, if you are a fan of the show’s dialogue, or clever dialogue in general, you will enjoy this book. There are a good number of memorable and poignant quotes throughout the book, my favorite being “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,” an apt summary for sure. Bottom line, when you pick up this book, be prepared to engross yourself and be swept away to a foreign land.VOICES/POINTS OF VIEW - Notable about this book, and all the books in the series, is that it is constantly switching from various characters points of view (POVs, as I’ll refer to them from now on). And by various, I mean roughly 7-8 characters. As difficult as this is to pull off, Martin does a great job. It’s an effective way to see what is going on in multiple locations at roughly the same time while keeping us invested. I applaud his decision to present us the information this way as it gives us a greater connection with the characters and more insight into various situations as we see how they are impacting the character that we are viewing it through. Not to mention, Martin manages to keep each of the individual POVs unique enough that you don’t need to flip back to see who’s narrating. Each character has distinct personality traits and ways of thinking/speaking that distinguish them from the others. Sansa is lady-like, a romantic and naive. Arya is fiery, resourceful and a fighter. Tyrion is shrewd, astute and full of quick-witted jibes. And so on and so forth. It is also worth noting that each character, even if a few of them are in the same place at the same time, sees different things and different people and analyzes situations in different ways, so each chapter gives you new information in some way or another. It’s very cleverly done and just as frustrating when you realize “UGH this character doesn’t know what was revealed to me, the reader, in THIS CHARACTER’S chapter” which is a great way of keeping you hooked.CHARACTERS: HEROES VS VILLAINS - Getting inside the characters heads, you start to understand their motives and the ways that they think. So you get to decide for yourself what motives are justified and who you believe in or who you’re rooting for. But then again, just because one character appears to be the “hero” of the story, doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily get a happy ending. If you’re looking for a feel-good story about about good conquering evil, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a story with deep, cunning characters who you can’t always trust, who are shades of grey versus black and white, then you’ll find this book a compelling read.DEPTH - Martin has done his homework and has developed rich histories for each of the characters and their houses. Hell, the Appendix of the book has small blurbs about each house, its history, its sigil, its words/slogan and the relevant members of the house. It’s always available for you to flip back and read if you find yourself confused, which can happen. Having watched the tv series, I was less confused about the various Houses and characters coming into the book, which helped a lot. Yet I still found myself learning new information from the Appendix. It’s a great tool and shows the author’s dedication to his characters and their backgrounds. I was impressed by how richly developed everything was, even though this is only the first book in the series.NO TEENAGE DIARY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT SEX - This book has sex in it. Quite a bit, too. I can see how this would be off-putting to some readers. Personally, I don’t mind it much. What I appreciated was that the descriptions of sex weren’t long, drawn out, excessively pornographic or mushy-gushy. I appreciated not having to wade through pages upon pages of “his fingers brushed against my fingers and my heart fluttered, he looked at me and I admired his beautiful eyelashes” or other mushy teenage romance dialogues that frankly bore the poop out of me. On the other hand, you’re not reading through pages and pages of detailed erotica either. It’s written very matter-of-factly, very bluntly and to-the-point and only went into a bit more description when it was warranted. Again, I imagine this isn’t for everyone, so you may consider this a negative. The way it was presented throughout the book, however, I felt warranted a checkmark in the “Good” category.FEMALE CHARACTERS - Some of the best depictions of female characters I have read. I was very impressed. The female characters are at all ends of the spectrum in this book, from feminine to tough to conniving. In a book where you’d assume the male characters take front and center, the female characters are just as fascinating, if not moreso in some cases.X-RAY - I have the Kindle version of this book. The X-Ray features really helps you keep track of the book’s many characters and remind you who someone is if you forget, which is SUPER helpful. I used the features many times throughout the book and it definitely aided my understanding and allowed me to further appreciate the depth of the characters and the story.--BADS:MULTIPLE POVs SLOW DOWN THE ACTION - The constant cutting back and forth between different characters and settings, while well done, also has the side effect of slowing down some of the action. You end a chapter on a cliffhanger as the one character’s POV learns something horrifying or experiences something shocking. But then the next chapter jumps to a character who is in a completely different setting and you have to wait until you get to a chapter of a character who is in place where the cliffhanger first happened. It slows down the action a bit, which can get a little frustrating. If it really bothers you to read a cliffhanger and then wait a few chapters to see a reaction or resolution to that cliffhanger, then this book might frustrate you more than entertain you. Not to mention, if you find one character’s voice/writing style/actions particularly boring, you might find it tiresome to have to wade through those chapters to get to the “good stuff.” I know I personally had that problem in a few instances.TYPOS - I have the Kindle version of this book, and it had quite a number of typos. Not on every page or anything, but more than I would have liked. A few of them sort of interrupted the flow of the story while I was reading, but for the most part they aren’t a huge deal. Just a little annoying.LENGTH - Not gonna lie, flipping through the Table of Contents and realizing there are 72 chapters was a little daunting. And if you have a really busy schedule, you might find the length a little scary too. I’m very glad I stuck it out and plowed through, though!--Overall, I’m a happy camper and am going to pick up the second book in the series ASAP!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let the Games Begin\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you're going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren't for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book's level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you'll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn't exactly paint a very big picture of what's to come. So I've decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own.With the murder of King Robert Baratheon's Hand `Jon Aryn', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King's Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn't just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned's bastard son `Jon Snow' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night's Watch', where desertion is punishable by death.While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren't believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They're opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin's equivalent of the Borgia's. Though if there's a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story's protagonists, but they aren't exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they're delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister', we're given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family.In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they're among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent.Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author's fiction. Martin's `Seven Kingdoms' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin's world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It's an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.There's going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin's work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin's writing is completely different from Tolkien's in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism.  But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they're ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They're not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they're morally ambiguous human beings. That's the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn't trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast.Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I'm not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they're all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I'm referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn't mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I'm all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It's little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, \"instead of making a movie they're going to milk it with a whole season of episodes\" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn't just a good idea, it's absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It's the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don't exactly have many of those.A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R. Martin's natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    True Literary Fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    [There is a thorough review for ASOIAF here on amazon which outlines many significant points, but I thought I'd put out a review in my own words, simply because I care so much about this series.]A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin consists of:1. A Game of Thrones (to be aired as the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 17, 2011)2. A Clash of Kings3. A Storm of Swords4. A Feast for Crows5. A Dance with Dragons (via Martin's \"Not a Blog\" LiveJournal, he has 3 POV chapters left to finish at the time of this writing.)6. The Winds of Winter (forthcoming)7. A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)What's all the fuss?This series is the progenitor of a new wave of literature which combines elements of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and intellectual literary fiction.  The idea was to create a true world (in all its color, grit, mystery, politics, realism and so on) through cultured prose, and yet still have all the elements of escapist fantasy; the idea was to create real people with real drama, and insert them into a fantastic reality; the idea was to reinvent the fantasy genre from cliché hack-and-slash/sword-and-sorcery to something original, passionate, and enthralling.Martin succeeded in these goals, and inspired others to follow in a similar vein: The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Prince of Nothing, The Gentleman Bastard, The First Law, etc.Why so good?1. Exceptional writing:  Martin is a literary master.  His prose doesn't just \"work,\" it really inspires.  His vocabulary is learned yet approachable.  The text inserts me directly into this medieval kingdom.  Imagery runs rampant with details galore.  Just a very well written story.2. Believable characters: Grey characters!  Real, believable characters with unique dialogue, motivations, and reactions populate this entire series.  Martin develops interesting personalities with his talent for voice.  These characters come alive within just a few pages of reading their chapters.  People change!  What a concept!3. Risk:  This is a world of blades and steel, arrows and leather.  People die in war.  This is a story of politics, intrigue, and betrayal.  People are assassinated.  Main characters may serve as a central window into the chief plotline, but that certainly doesn't mean that they are safe from harm.  Pain and death MEAN something, and Martin loves to make us feel.4. History:  Martin has spent years living in this world, and the history is so rich that the immersion is instant.  It's almost disorienting.  The details that he has planned out and the meticulousness of the layers within the story are so natural that you cannot help but be in awe.5. Tactful use of fantasy elements:  No \"magic missile\" spells or \"jelly-legs\" jinxes here.  There are strong fantasy elements, but they are used in tactful, and oftentimes subtle, ways.  The supernatural is seen as superstition by most of the characters in the story, and so when something akin to \"magic\" does show up, it is unique and potent.6. Details matter:  Watch the description of a character, even if you don't know the character's name; they'll show up later.  Actually think about what people say; you may be able to find out the answer to a question far before the characters do.  Dreams and prophecies may be vague, but they are actually vital!  Martin has also acknowledged his use of the unreliable narrator (in fact, he has to use it, in order to make the POV chapters believable); find the inconsistencies between what happens and what characters think, and see the story from a different perspective!7. Engaging plot:  All three main plotlines are exotic and entertaining: the fight for power over Westeros' throne, the exile of the last Targaryen queen, and the threat of the Others in the north.  Filled with cliffhangers chapter after chapter, mysteries that need solving, epic moments of badassery, horrible moments of dread, cool one-liners and philosophical quotes, raunchy sex, and violent death, the story is brimming with awesome.Why doesn't everyone like this series, then?Virtually every one- or two-star review I have seen (amazon, goodreads, etc.) can be boiled down to one of three categories:1. \"The Fantasy Lover\" (a.k.a. \"Sex is Nasty\" Syndrome)a. \"Ew, it's so gross and disgusting and tragic and there's so much sex and violence and swearing!  Where is my damsel being rescued by the handsome, heroic prince?  Why do people die?  I felt like `washing in industrial cleanser' to get this filth away from me!  Fantasy should only be about romantic ideals and have nothing to do with reality... and the good guys should always win!\"b. To you, I say, stop being such a prude.  The writing is excellent and appropriate to its content, and the idea is to explore the connection between fantasy and reality.  Fantasy does not have an \"end purpose\" in mind, and you are simply being obstinate about originality and progress.  People are not black and white and neither is life; people die, and people are maimed, and people have sex, and people go to the bathroom, and people are raped, and sometimes, the `bad guys' win; however, I think escapist fantasy may be even MORE engaging when combined with those aspects of reality... and that is an opinion enjoyed by millions of people.2. \"The Whiner\" (a.k.a. \"The Author is My Bitch\" Syndrome)a. \"It's been five years since the last book, and Martin is fat and old, and he has his fingers in so many pies, and he doesn't care about the series anymore, and he's just trying to milk it, and why can't he finish it already, and I could have the next book written by now, and and and and and....\"b. To you, I say, no, the author is not your slave.  Your buying his books did not indenture him into servitude, nor did it oblige a contract. He writes when he writes, and you read when he's done.  Complaining about it [timing, his other projects, etc.] makes you look pathetic, silly, and a tad bit unstable. It's like trying to intimidate a world-renowned TV chef to finish his/her magnum opus because you just want lunch on your TV tray, damnit!  How full of yourself do you have to be?c. Also, the books do not deserve a one star rating simply because they aren't coming out as fast as you want.3. \"The Pragmatist\" (a.k.a. \"But Reading Takes So Much Time!\" Syndrome)a. \"The first book is 800 pages, and they just get longer from there; there's no end in sight for the series and no single book tells a full story; there's too much exposition with too much `backstory'; the plot is so slow!\"b. To you, I say... well, this might actually be a valid concern for some people.  The story IS huge... but in case you didn't see the genre description, it is EPIC fantasy, and Martin has himself described it as having a \"cast of thousands.\"  The advantages of longer books are that characters can develop into fully fleshed out beings and that a fictional world can become, in some part, real.  It's also a huge story in terms of scope - the synopsis states it simply enough: \"...where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime....\"Minor Spoilers on Individual Books:A Game of ThronesA brilliant first book, this begins each of the three main plots.  For the first plot, the main house we deal with here is the Starks, the house \"in charge\" of the North.  For the second plot, we are introduced to the naiveté of Daenerys (Duh-NAIR-iss) and for the third, we get to see the shabby condition of the Night's Watch.  Though each plot develops independently, it is easy to see how they interconnect.  The characters really drive this piece, and it is a true trip for anyone, new or old, to the genre.  A 5 star book if there ever was one.Obliviously, I not only recommend this specific book, but the entire series.  All the best, and happy reading!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    An unven song of Ice and Fire\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A long journey with no end in sight. I'll try to avoid much plot beyond was it needed to be mentioned and focus more on the strengths and failings of each book.The first of a planned trilogy turned two trilogies turned to seven, possibly eight books, A Game of Thrones begins as one story but ends somewhere else entirely. Following the usurping of the \"mad king\" King Robert Baratheon has sits upon the Iron Throne uncomfortably (as if there was any other way to sit upon a seat made entirely of swords melted together) caring more to hunt, whore and drink than rule. His wife, unbeknown to him, has birthed three children with her own brother and claimed them as Robert's. When his Hand (either the Hand speaks with the voice of the King, or, the King s***s and the Hand wipes) dies suddenly he heads north to Winterfell to induct his childhood friend and partner in rebellion, Neddard Stark to take the position.Soon the Stark family is divided, Ned's Bastard is sent to The Wall, a massive 700 foot high block of ice that damns the north from the rest of Westeros, as his wife will not have him around without Ned and he can't take him with to court. The two youngest children stay behind while Ned takes his eldest son and two daughters (the older of whom is to marry Robert's heir, Joffery) to Kings Landing to rule.Soon it is obvious that Robert's wife Cerci has plotted to kill Robert, take Ned stark, claim the thrown for her incest born son and rule as Queen until he comes of age. This is when the story takes flight.Though it seems to start as a tale of \"winter coming\" (winter being less a season and more like a minor ice-age that hits every other generation or so and my last for years or decades) it quickly turns into a power struggle pulling all the lands off all the world in.We also meet Danny, the youngest daughter of the \"Mad King\" whose brother attempts to sell her as a wife to gain an army of horse lords to take back the Iron Throne. This ends poorly for the conceded fool, but Danny learns she has the true blood-of-the-dragons in her, she cannot be burned by fire and by the end of the book she has hatched three baby dragons from believed fossilized eggs.Elsewhere Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis each prepare to claim the throne as word of Joffery's bastard status is spread, as well Robb Stark, the eldest son calls his father's bannermen to lead an assault against the Lannisters. Which leads us to the next novel.In A Clash of Kings, Martin tells the story of the war of the seven kingdoms. It seems every lord wants to proclaim himself king (new ones pop up every day, it is noted) and they are both marching on Kings Landing, and against each other.It's here that one of the strongest characters, Tyrion Lannister, twins Cerci and Jamie's younger sibling, a dwarf despised by his family and hated by his father for \"killing\" his mother when he came into the world. Tyrion is well read and educated and early on unaware of the incest between his twin siblings. After being accused in the first book of trying to kill one of the Stark sons, Tyrion has bought his way home with a sellsword and wildlings under his employ and upon finding his father in battle against Robb, is sent to Kings Landing to be Hand to Joffery. Here we see how smart Tyrion is as he outwits both his sister and Stannis at every turn and ultimately saves them all from invasion and secures Joffery's throne a bit longer.Unlike Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings tells a less character driven story. Many new characters and locations are introduced, which, on first reading can be confusing. Though the first book would have you think the Starks are the focus of these books, you find out fast that anyone can die and there's no clear option for who the reader should perceive as good or bad, or even the better of all other options. As well it seems like Danny has been left with little to do but wonder the dessert, plot revenge, raise her dragons and suffer.A Storm of Swords may easily be the best book of the series. Bracing, swift and epic (one of the longest of the series at over 1000 pages) it focuses almost squarely on the central characters, advances the plot lines in a satisfying manner and sweeps you into the one real page turning of the series.Sansa Stark has been un-betrothed to the bastard king Joffery, who is to marry of all people, Renly's widow (a supposed 16 yr old virgin widow.) However, Sansa is swiftly and forcibly (for both) wed to Tyrion the imp, no with half a nose and a full face scar from battle. Tyrion has never seemed to have it out for the Starks like his Sister and Father and is actually as kind to the stiff and horrified Sansa (not quite 13 years old) until they are both accused of murder. Sansa his whisked away by her Aunts new husband and assumes the role of his bastard daughter to hide. Tyrion is locked up and condemned.Meanwhile Robb Stark learns a hard lesson about breaking vows and he and his mother suffer dearly. Arya, the youngest sister has been captured for ransom, Jon Snow lives and returns from behind the wall with the wildings only to be stuck trying not to take sides in the war as Stannis comes to the aid of the wall and demands to be treated like King even though he's yet to claim the throne. Danny buys 8000 slave warriors trading one of her dragons, then turns them on there masters, sacks the city and heads out to build her army and free slaves on her way to Kings Landing to take back the throne.Which all leads to the low-point of the series, A Feast for Crows... exactly what we, the readers, may feel we got. Not to say that it's all bad, just a poor choice in publishing. Crows is actually only half of the novel, the other half is the first half of A Dance with Dragons. Confused? Due to length issues Martin took have the character chapters and put them in Feast and saved the other half of the chapters for Dance, but didn't publish them together. Instead he doubled the length of Dance over five years, having the events of that novel and Feast meet in the middle and then run congruent again for the second half.The result is Feast is almost entirely the story of Kings Landing and the Lannisters with a few chapters on Greyjoy's and Arya and little else. Then in Dance you get the same time frame, but every-one elses stories. Some of it is not only redundant information including sections of chapters reprinted verbatim. In one case a character you know dies in Feast, has several chapters in Dance as the congruent story lines would have him still alive at the early points in the book.A Game of Thrones (could be titled La Morte D'Eddard) is a strong opening novel about the misfortunes that befall the Stark family which sets up the great war which is the framing for the other books to come.A Clash of Kings: An epic but often impersonal war story saved by the tales of Tyrion Lannister as he serves as Hand to the King and chief outwiter of his wicked sister, Cerci. Many new characters and locations can make the book a bit hard to follow but the set-up brings us...A Storm of Swords: The series high point, epic and moving, it fleshes out characters in events in a meaningful way and draws the reader into a real page-turner.At this point there is clear divide in the structure and writing. Martin begins to write a moment by moment of every character, never does he seem to be able to say, \"A few weeks later\" instead we must get every detail of every moment of everyday. I skipped entire pages of prose with Martin rambling on and on without progressing story or developing character.A Feast for Crows: This half-entry in the series can drag miles long, completely ignoring the major plot lines of Jon Snow, Danney and Tyrion it leaves us almost entirely at the hands of the Lannisters.A Dance with Dragons: Finally some life back into the series, tells the events of the characters left out of  Feast but sometimes rehashing already known information or lacking suspense as Feast provided spoilers for Dance. Martin sets us up to endure the long winter at last.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    How George R. R. Martin made me a fan of epic fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I finished reading Game of Thrones this morning and I thought a review of the book was in order, despite having mentioned it already on several occasions. Be warned there are spoilers present! So without further delay, here is how George R. R. Martin made me into a fan of epic fantasy:1. He altered my preconceived notions of what an epic fantasy is supposed to be. In my head, all epic fantasy was simply a retelling of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It all contained elves and wizards and dragons. Magic played a big role. Ambitious quests were the order of the day. And it was almost always good versus evil. Game of Thrones broke all the rules in this respect. The \"dwarf\" was so through a birth defect. There were no wizards. While magic was hinted at, we see almost none in the book. There were no quests. Nor was there a clear good or evil. (Joffrey seems evil, but he's really just a kid trying to be a man.) From the moment I started reading the book, it was not at all what I expected. And that was refreshing.2. His characters were among the most complex people I've come across in science fiction and fantasy (Connie Willis has equally complex characters in her novels.) These are not characters who necessarily behave the way their position dictates. A fighter isn't always brave. A lady isn't always meek. An old man isn't always wise and a young boy isn't always a child. The burdens of the leaders of men weigh heavily upon them and that comes through in the book. By the end of the book, I began to feel like I knew some of the characters so well that I could guess at their reactions to a situation and be pleased to find that I was usually right. They feel like friends to me, not caricatures.3. His world-building is masterful without being intrusive. There is enough of the world and its background to give you a good understanding of the time and place of the events, without taking you out of the story. And yet, there is enough hinted at but not said to leave you wondering. For instance: how on Earth did they build that wall? The society is a complex one (after all, it is a melding of seven kingdoms, each with its own rich history) but it is presented clearly in the narrative at times and places that are appropriate to the story. Unlike Tolkien, Martin doesn't step out of the story to give a lengthy history (except, perhaps, once toward the end of the book when Bran is learning about the early days of his people). The laws in this universe are self-consistent and add value to the story as a whole.4. He makes you forget you are reading epic fantasy. Instead, from almost the very beginning, you feel like you are integrated into the lives of people in a world that is different from our own, but still recognizable. That there are tropes of epic fantasy becomes incidental. What matters is the story, the characters, and how it all plays out. I think the same is true of Connie Willis' Blackout/All Clear and it is a rare writer that can make you forget the genre in which you are reading, but fall so deeply into a story as to feel as if you've become part of it.5. He dangles the magic just far enough of your reach to make its effect all the more worthwhile. I call this the Superman-effect. Whenever I watch various incarnations of Superman, I am always looking forward to when and how he will use his powers. But in skilled story-telling, it is few and far-between, even though we want to see it more. Martin hints at powers both great and terrible throughout the novel. There are the direwolves, the Stark's have taken. There is something special about them. There was Bran's remarkable dream during his coma. But really, we only see a remarkable display of magic or effect in two places: first when the wight's attack Jon and the Lord Commander in Castle Black on the Wall. And later, at the very end of the novel when the three dragons are born in a remarkable funeral pyre. Such judicious use of magic, sprinkled tantalizingly throughout the novel but coated thickly only twice had a profound effect on me as a reader.6. He spins a remarkable tale. There was not a single point in the book where I thought to myself, this is getting a little slow; I really wish I could skip on and find out about so-and-so. Each time I thought it might happen (usually in scenes from Sansa's point of view) I found to my surprise that I was captured by the story being told, by the subplots unfolding, and by the vast tapestry being laid out before me. More often than not, I had to force myself to stop reading or I would have trouble getting up for work the next morning.He tells a gritty story with an honesty I haven't seen much of in science fiction and fantasy. The grittiness of the world is part of what attracted me to it. These were not tales involving the angelic elves of Rivendell. These were tales of men at war, men who were greedy and rapacious. These were tales of women who were cruel. These were tales of men who strove for honor but didn't always live up to the name. In short these were the tales of ourselves as we really and truly are, not saints, not sinners, but somewhere in that vast purgatory in between. James Morrow in his novel Only Begotten Daughter, as well as in his Godhead Trilogy, is the only one who comes to mind at telling so brutal and honest a tale.7. He isn't afraid to take risks, up to and including killing off major characters. It was one thing to see Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed by Ned at the order of the King. It was quite another to see Eddard Stark beheaded after living his life for 8/10th of the book. It was almost as difficult to see Khal Drogo's demise, sad and pathetic as it was. Or King Robert's for that matter. It was difficult to see Bran paralyzed, Sansa abused by Joffrey, and Arya begging in the streets. Difficult: but that is life. Nothing can be counted on by yourself in this world that Martin has created and for the reader, that means that no one person is special, despite what they might think of themselves. It leaves plenty of room for surprise and emotion.Even the most perfect story can't please everyone 100%. If there were any minor flaws in the story, there are two that I would call to attention:1. I felt that the phrase \"play this game of thrones\" was used a little too much. At least, it stood out to me more than any other phrase in the book. Even \"Winter is coming\" was tempered and used to elevate the mystery of these long winters. But hearing the phrase \"game of thrones\" repeated again and again by the various players didn't ring true to my ears. Once or twice, maybe, but beyond that it felt like the reader was being beat over the head with it.2. I can only imagine the frustration of the reader who read this book hot off the presses-only to find so many loose-ends untied, with the story ending essentially at a climax-and perhaps with no idea when or if there would be a sequel. In my case, at least, I was able to downloadA Clash of Kings to my Kindle the moment I finished reading Game of Thrones.I rarely give out a 5-star review and if you look at novels I've ranked with 5-stars, you'll find that it is a very select class. But Game of Thrones has now joined them. And I'm so glad there are more books to discover in this world.(This review originally appeared on my website: [...])\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Last Person in the World to Read This\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It's been ages since I originally purchased this book on my Kindle. I saw the size of the book and when I got my Kindle it was one of the first purchases I made. I figured it would be better to carry it on that slim device than to lug around the rather large book. I wanted to read the book prior to the premier of the show but... well that didn't happen. So my goal shifted; I wanted to read the first book before the second season began and that also didn't happen. Well, I gave it a try at least. I began reading this book in April just after I moved to Virginia and didn't have a job. I would spend my mornings putting out job applications and then by late afternoon I'd sit back and read a little. But the size of this book overwhelmed me, not that I haven't read anything of this size before, but for some reason the slow moving percentage on my Kindle wasn't being very helpful. Then I got my temp job and this book was put down.Back and forth over the past five months I went. I would read a new book, put it down, then read 50 pages of Game of Thrones. Not only that but with trying to maintain a regularly updated book blog with ramblings about books I've read it's hard to just guarantee a number of days to read this huge book. However, I finished a book and went back to GoT for my few chapter read through and realized I was actually pretty darn close to being finished. Only, like, 200 pages left! So I read it in a flash and loved every moment of it then sat back and wondered why I hadn't just read it in one go to begin with.Nonetheless, let's talk about the book for the very few people out there who haven't read it. Because, it seems, I am the last person in the world who got around to starting this series. If you've seen the show it's a lot like the book; they did a very good job at portraying the characters and many of the scenes in my opinion. Still, this book is long so obviously it has much more detail and scenery than the show does. If you've seen the show but have not read the book I'd suggest doing so!While I wasn't keen on carrying around a copy of the book because it was so large I do wish, in a way, that I had that opportunity so that I could flip back and forth between the maps and family trees. It would have helped as the cast of the book is huge and the families are very wide spread and detailed. I have forever had issues of remembering people's names, book characters included, and had it not been for the fact that I had already watched the tv show and had faces to place with the names I probably would have been more lost as to who was who and how they were connected.The story is good, the imagery is good, the description is good. This book is good. If you have a fascination with anything remotely like Tudor history, Arthurian legend or the long, detailed writing in Lord of the Rings then A Song of Ice and Fire is perfect for you. Dragons, princesses, secrets and swords fill its pages and often times left my head spinning. This book has a touch of fantasy but it doesn't go overboard. You aren't stuck feeling like you just slipped into the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy or Hogwarts. It's slipped in so casually that you find yourself, whilst reading the book, to just accept what they are speaking of and not think twice about if dragons exist or the dead can rise and kill.Martin may put a little too much emphasis into certain details but I suspect they all come around to meaning something and he certainly helps you to picture the world he has created. It reads like some fantastic part of history yet the characters are certainly living and breathing at your ear, over your shoulder, while you go from page to page. Often times I'll read books by authors who have long since left this earth and I'm left feeling melancholy. \"Why don't people write like this anymore? Why don't they put detail into their books and write so beautifully?\" and I think I've discovered that there are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them. It's refreshing to be able to read a book so beautifully written and with such perfect detail that is current and published within my lifetime. Could it have been shortened down at some points? Certainly. Every other chapter I found at least a few pages that I could have gone without but what are you going to do? It's not like I didn't already know this was going to be a long book when I began it.It does have its fair share of sex scenes, incest, and rape so be forewarned of that those of you who like to avoid such plot. But it's relevant to the story, or so it seems... most of the time, so it's kind of worth talking about. Martin leaves a lot of tidbits of information through out the book which you can pick apart in your own time and wonder what it all could mean. Apparently, it's a Thing fans of the series like to do and I can understand why they would when it spans such long periods of time between publications of books. In that regard, I'm glad I waited to pick up the books so that I won't have to wait forever for each book to come out. Granted, when A Song of Ice and Fire was first published I was ten and this was way beyond my reading comprehension but at least now I can take my time, play catch up, and maybe once I'm completely caught up with the books I can join the countless others who eagerly await the next book in the series.I think what I liked best about the books was that the characters grow and change while you read. Often times you are able to witness how the surrounding events will alter a person or you are simply given privy to details otherwise unnoticed. I started the book with a dead set group of characters whom I liked and ones I disliked but by the end of the book that list had shuffled a little bit. Some of the characters I disliked at first (Sansa, for example) I had begun to like a little more by the end. While I have many other books I have to get through before I start A Clash of Kings I will be happy when I have that opportunity and look forward to it. There are many people out there who love this book and consider it a work of art, the best thing they had ever read, and swear by it. There are others who refuse to speak nothing but negative things about the book - it just did not work for them. For me, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and while I may not be standing on my office's roof proclaiming to the people waiting for their lunches that they must read this book - I still will quietly refer friends to it who are looking for a good tale.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Amazing\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    One of the best books I've ever read could not put it down and  my god the story telling was fantastic.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"1"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Banger\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Banger, literally amazing after watching the show.

Tolkien ...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was recommended this book by a friend who said it would be like Tolkien's adventures. However, since I have heard this comparison so often now, I maybe should start my praise by explaining why this book is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from anything J. R. R. Tolkien has ever written. In fact, the only thing Tolkien has in common with this are the presence of strong characters, a somewhat medieval setting, and that a vast and epic world is described. But these are pretty much hallmarks of much of the fantasy genre in general and can hardly be used to distinguish authors. Unlike \"the Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\", or \"The Children of Húrin\" for that matter, the world of \"A Game of Thrones\" depends much less on magic. Yes, the world that is described contained dragons long ago, but they are gone now. There is talk of giants, but nobody has ever seen them and they may be only rumours. There may be \"The Others\", but again it is unclear whether they really exist or still have any power and they are mostly referred to in curses, much the same way we would say \"To hell with you\" not knowing whether a hell actually exists. The main characters are all clearly human, look human, behave as humans, have human flaws and human strengths. Unlike in Tolkien's books there are no prominent wizards, hobbits, orks, elves, dwarfs, or demons dominating the story line. Secondly, the characters in \"A Game of Thrones\" are neither perfect heroes nor evil to the bone villains. Everybody has their understandable motives and behaves logically from their perspective, although, of course, the goals and ends of the various characters clash causing the wars and conflicts and intrigues to happen that make the book so captivating to read. Unlike Tolkien's adventures, \"A Game of Thrones\" is not about the battle between good and evil, black and white, light and darkness. This makes the whole storyline appear enormously realistic, as the world here is so much more like our own. Also the language is totally different between Tolkien's stories and this book. Whereas Tolkien uses his beautiful poetic language, George R. R. Martin is extremely blunt. Some of the words he uses, I have never seen in a printed book, and if I were to repeat them here in this review, I am sure Amazon would be deleting my entire text. Also the description of cruelty, rape, and war is very graphic in this book. Again, this makes it much more a realistic book, as in our own world these things are (unfortunately) much more common than selfless knights singing poems to their beloved elven girlfriend. However, also \"A Game of Thrones\" plays extensively with language, even though in a very different, more subtle way than Tolkien did. For instance, the names of the characters are often slightly modified variants of existing names (Petyr instead of Peter, Catelyn instead of Catherine, Eddard instead of Edward etc.) and many terms that are used are either invented or ancient versions of existing words (mayhaps instead of perhaps, import instead of importance, turncloak instead of turncoat etc.). This gives the text an interesting effect, providing us with a warm familiarity with the world on the one hand (we often feel at home here), while at the same time we appear to be in a strange, different place. What I, personally, also like is the way how the story is told. The many chapters are rather short but always told from the perspective of a particular main character. Therefore, the reader understands their motives, understands what is driving them to do or not do whatever they are doing, understands why they love or hate or despise other characters and how this influences their actions. And because the perspective out of which the story is told constantly changes, there is no \"absolute truth\", no \"right angle\", no \"good and evil\"; only competing interests of all too human players. I will not mention details from the book as I do not want to spoil anyone's fun who has not read it yet. But I will say so much that George R. R. Martin has no problem killing off beloved characters. And unlike in Tolkien's books, dead characters do not come back to life (\"Hello Gandalf\"). Also this introduces a grim reality into the story. Playing the game of thrones can be deadly.To me this was the best fantasy story I have read in a long time. I have already started the second book (also great!) and there will be at least five more to come. Given the writing style and the type of story, \"A Game of Thrones\" reads much more like the historical novels from Bernard Cornwell than anything Tolkien has ever written. Which is not to say that Tolkien is not great. I love Tolkien's books (!) but they are very different and I feel the customer should know this before the purchase, particularly as this comparison is made again and again and again for reasons I do not understand. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes good fantasy with deep non-stereotypic characters, sad (sometimes really sad!) turns in the story, and a realistic (sometimes too realistic) world with all the cruelties of war, battle, and conquest. Amazon limits me to give a maximum of five stars. I would rather like to give six, seven, or hundred.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    SUMMER IS OVER.  WINTER IS COMING.  BOOKS RULE.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    FIRST PUBLISHED BACK in 1996, the opening volume of the fantasy epic called A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is immediately captivating, enthralling, entertaining, and even shocking.  This is epic fantasy at its best.  Well, for some of the book, anyway.  It is also immediately obvious why and how this book (and in fact the whole series) has become one of the most watched, and most loved TV shows ever made.  I won’t say that it was written just to be adapted, but the genius of the author has created a fictional world so well populated with amazing characters, who in turn love each other and hate each other with such passion that at times the book simply sizzles.  At certain points in the book some characters are seen to be doing unmentionables to each other, and when discovered by innocent parties, take further measures so extreme in order to protect themselves you may well find yourself in such shock that you literally wont be able to put the book down.Long term fans of the genre will make immediate comparisons to other giants (!) of the field, and the first name to spring to mind will, of course, be J R R Tolkien, with his breathtaking LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  On a superficial level, Martin’s books are longer (by a looooong way) and yet despite the extra length and time involved in writing and reading them, he has failed to gift the reader with the quality of prose, and downright beauty, that is the trademark of Gandalf, Frodon, Elrond and company.Humour has a minor role in the book, but only with certain clans.  I am thinking of the Lannisters here, folks, but only the loveable and highly durable Tyrion (the imp) demonstrates qualities of this nature worth mentioning.  And of course he uses humour as a defence mechanism in order to cope with the situations and compromises he finds himself in on a daily basis.For the rest of the cast, life is much, much, much too serious to be caught laughing.  And it’s only going to get worse.  Winter is coming, you see.  One of the plethora of strong features of GOT is character development, and they oftentimes grow and develop right before your eyes.  Obviously time passes in this book but i found it immensely satisfying seeing how some of the younger generations of the book’s populace cope with, and grow into, roles they find themselves in.  Some under duress, some at the hands of fate and some, Gods forbid, at the result of their own engineering.There is the subtle hint of dragons making an appearance in the story, but having just reached page 604 out of 780 I do believe that the reader is running out of time and words if they are going to be blessed with the presence of these magnificent creatures in the first book of this epic fable.  Of course there is a lot more going on than just the re-emergence of dragons; like i just mentioned, Winter is Coming, and even though that is a saying strongly favoured by the Starks, it may well turn out to be a metaphor that affects the entire world that Mr Martin has so wonderfully crafted.The pace of the book ebbs and flows.  It started off well, with several major emotional shocks hitting the reader full in the face early on.  By page 300 I was ready to declare my personal love for Catelyn Stark (I still am) but then things slowed down and i found myself forced to carry on the exploration of this fantastic world i have become lost in.  And for every page i forced myself to read, i found myself resenting the time doing so, and not spent playing hide and seek in Middle Earth with Sauron and company.  But then the pace of the book picked up again, new characters came to life and a multitude of betrayals took place which made my investment more than worthwhile.Some of the locations described in the book are truly breath taking. Some of the ideas, too, are good enough to make you yearn to become one with the book and morph yourself right there.  This book is incredibly deep.  Characters that are presumably killed off are spoken of with such fervour and respect that you may well find yourself hoping against hope that they will be found again.  There are many aspect of the book that have moved me, or grabbed my imagination by the throat and not let go.  I have attempted to keep this review spoiler free and purposely vague at times.  I can fully imagine myself reading GAME OF THRONES multiple times.  Not for the beauty of the prose, because that is not its strong point.  But certainly in order to relieve the drama, and the excitement, the cliffhangers and the shocks, you could certainly call me a fan.Four stars for a dead set modern day classic.  It is not perfect by any means, and i can only assume the story will get stronger as i make progress through the books.  Watch this space and I will let you know.Summer is over.  Winter is coming.

The only reason I read this book was, well, the same reason a lot of people read this book, and that was because they’re a fan of the HBO series.  I actually never even started watching the show until after season five was over.  Like most, I was incredibly impressed with the show.Watching the show, however, contained a lot of frustrating elements if you’re not a big fan of “Fantasy”.  Where does this world exist?  What is the history?  Why do the “seasons” seem to last several years instead of only a few months?  Well, these are things that you really shouldn’t try too hard to understand.  Doing such a thing takes away too much joy as one should just relax and be entertained.  One shouldn’t worry about, when watching “Star Wars” for example, why “The Force” can tell you when a planet is being blown up a bazillion miles away, yet it can’t tell you when you’re kissing your own sister.The biggest frustration when watching the show is the multitude of major and minor characters that parade in and out of the scenes.  There’s so many people to keep track of, and they all have lengthy histories before the story ever even starts.  So we have to assimilate all of the different kingdoms, the different players (all with “Fantasy” names – no Doug, Skip, or Mary), all of the arranged marriages, all the incestuous relationships, all the children born out of wedlock, etc.etc.  If you’re new to the show, I would recommend watching with the Closed Caption turned on – it’s really helpful to keep all of the players in order.Which is why this book is so handy and welcome.  Reading this book allows you to revisit the story that you already know, but at a slower pace.  I actually learned a lot about the characters that, while I’m sure the show told me, it was in such a quick manner that it was quickly lost on me.  It’s easy to follow some of the main characters – Tyrion, Eddard, Cersie, and Jamie, but when you get to all the minor ones and what their exact roles are in this epic yarn, it helps to have it all written down.  I now know, for example, a lot more about the character of Theon Greyjoy, and don’t refer to him in my head only as “the guy that looks like Mick Jaggar”.Still, though, even the book is weighted down with too many characters.  Fortunately, there is a handy “who’s who” in the back of the book that aids one tremendously, but such references are quite hard to access when reading a story on an E-book, such as I did.The plot?  Well, from what I can tell, there are seven kingdoms in this fantasy world, but the kingdom of Kings Landing is the kingdom that rules overall.  Obviously, all of the kings think that they’re the rightful heir to this role, so the “Game of Thrones” consists of armies and kingdoms constantly fighting, negotiating, battling and marrying their offspring to form alliances.  It’s a big complicated game, all right.  There’s also some elements not familiar to our world that appear from time to time – we have dragons, white walkers, and “stone” people that all tend to complicate things, but make for a better overall story.The first book is essentially season one.  The book doesn’t deviate much at all from the show, which I think is a good thing in this case.  As I’m writing this review, there have been five books written, and five seasons of the show, so I’m guessing they match up pretty evenly.Had the show not been so brilliantly done, I don’t think I ever would have bothered to pick up the book, but there’s a reason that the series is as highly regarded as it is.  The scenery in itself is incredibly beautiful and majestic, and the acting is first rate.  Of course, there’s a lot of blood, even more violence, and even more explicit sex.  But that’s HBO for you.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Shipped  swiftly\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Listen to shipping instructions great\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Amazing book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Amazing start to an amazing series.

But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot.  Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre.  There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews.  If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!!  The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups:BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally).I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic.  Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created.  I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS.  To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films.  The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous.  In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book.BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders.I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next.  But people who want Mr Martin to \"finish the series\" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together.  I have no such expectation.  This is not Lord of the Rings.  Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone.  If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales!BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers.By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on.  Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created.  Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - \"I want to know what happens to so and so right now!\"  They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story.  It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete.  Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third.  With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story.  If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up.  Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor.  This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell!  That way you always know what you are getting.BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR:  The Kindle reviews.Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews.  And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version.  I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself.  Just imagine trying to travel with all five books!If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so.  Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will.  If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination.  For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales.Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world.  I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    One helluva read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    674 pages of non-stop narrative & action.  Most fantasy fiction falls flat from a literary perspective, and also runs the risk of being harshly compared to LOTR.  G.R.R. Martin matches J.R.R. Tolkien when it comes to imagination and complexity of purpose (though Tolkien will kick ANYONE'S ass when it comes to a mastery of the English language).  Martin also sets very high goals for his opus and peoples it with HUNDREDS of characters (seriously, I gave up counting after I hit two hundred).  The maps leave a lot to be desired, especially when he writes about lands for which the book provides NO maps (i.e., ALL the chapters concerning Daenerys).  THAT was a major error on the publisher's part.  The best literary device used is titling the multiple chapters via the names of the eight major characters: Bran, Catelyn, Daenerys, Eddard, Jon, Arya, Tyrion, and Sansa.  The perspective is third-person omniscient but filtered through the time and space of the character in the chapter title; very neat actually.  The plot is often non-linear, which can make the read a bit confused and confusing.  Chapters have a habit of overlapping a bit, but this can be attributed to the unique mode of communication used throughout the novel (raven).The book is really about House Stark and its delicate dance of death with House Lannister.  And, in Book1, things do not go at all well for House Stark.Tyrion is, clearly, the authors favorite character (and, mine), since he is given ALL of the killer lines in the book.  Many times, I found myself laughing out loud at the outrageous impertinence of The Imp.  This character comes completely alive as he is fully-fleshed out as a most fatally-flawed yet truly decent human being.  Hell, Martin could've just called the book Tyrion Lannister., not because most of the book's pages are dedicated to him, but because he steals the show.Catelyn has the most pages (106) but her character is too introverted and internally troubled to jump off the page, like Tyrion.Other characters that you can tell are headed for great stories in succeeding books (in addition to Tyrion) are the angry and under-developed Jon and the interesting and androgynous Arya.The one flaw in almost ALL the characters is something I suspect that Martin WANTED in the characters: they are all, to varying degrees, incredibly naive (stupid even) and self-destructive in their pursuit of either honor or power (or both).Also, the hedonistic sexuality and over-the-top barbarism might turn off the average reader.  However, Martin tries to bring alive (and does!) an age that parallels European medievalism.  In other words: don't get too attached to characters.  And there are just too damned many \"Houses\" to keep track of.  While I know the publisher probably balked at the expense, it sure would've been nice to have a comprehensive list of the Houses, together with all of their sigils (in color), castles, and lands.  Think The Clans of Scotland or Ireland and you'll know what I mean.The ironic aspect of this book is that you will find yourself rooting for certain people (quite a few actually) to die horrible, grisly deaths (pretty much any of the Lannisters and Cleganes and members of the Small Council).  Of course, you also yearn to sit down for a beer with some of the other rascals (Tyrion and Bronn immediately come to mind).  If Martin can make you hate (and admire) some of his characters so viscerally, then you know he is doing something right.  He is a very compelling novelist and I very much look forward to watching the series now (which I had denied myself UNTIL I read the books).Lastly, while Tolkien's characters are too archetypical to identify with, most of Martin's are too barbaric.  Only a few rise to truly great heights, the highest of which is inhabited by Tyrion Lannister.  Bravo, Mr. Martin!  Bravo!  Who'da thunk we'd be made to cheer for such a wretched, self-loathing dwarf - until we come to realize that he is the only character with a fully developed conscience and sense of true decency.  Bravo.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Game Of Thrones Book One\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George R. R. Martin is a literary crackerjack. His episodic, massively detailed,  completely fleshed-out, throughly chronicled world of Westeros complete with a multitude of characters is an undeniable page turner. Starting in the cold hard packed lands of the north filled with honor bound men and many a thing that goes bump in the night, the reader is led south to the seat of power in the Red Keep-- the iron throne. On this journey, you meet both pawns and kings and realize quickly that every act in public and promise in secret is building towards a power coup that could end the realm. Trouble descends from every direction. Intrigue is plotted in every shadow. And no one-- I mean no one-- is safe. Who will win the match and live to see another day? Because in the game of thrones you either win, or you die.This book just does it for me on so many levels. Martin's style is fully detailed but not overly flowery. I appreciate the succinct way he describes the people, the places, and the power struggles. It allows you to get engrossed in your imagination without getting swamped in the mountains of words on the pages. That is not to say that this is a brief read. This book is long, but I think even the faint of heart will look up several hours later and realize they have read 200 pages. Don't let the thickness of the book dissuade you from the fabulous story inside.Characters are the mortar that binds this book together. Martin's story is chocked full of some amazing people. Some of my personal favorites are:*Jon Snow the bastard(Martin's words not mine) son of an otherwise honorable man who leaves his family in search of adventure beyond Winterfell.*Arya Stark the rough and tough young lady of the north using a sharp tongue and shaper sword to get into all kinds of trouble and scrapes both at home and in the capital.*Tyrion Lannister the ill-begotten dwarf son of the richest of men who uses his brain in the absence of brawn.Martin is also talented at writing characters you hate. Some that I loathe are:*Prince Joffery Baratheon the cruel, painfully immature, and frighteningly merciless young king to be.*Ser Ilyn Payne the mutilated and muted knight bent on delivering the king's justice... with his axe.*Queen Cersei Baratheon the cunning, manipulative, and grasping woman beside the king who'll stop at nothing and step over anyone to stay on top.And this is really only the briefest of lists. So many characters to love and loathe and then loathe and love in turns. Get reading!The book is so good that I need to give you a disclaimer. DO NOT watch the HBO series first if you can help it. Season One of GOT did such an amazing job recreating Martin's book that it steals a bit of the glory from the novel if viewed before the book. Many of the conversations and small details are EXACTLY like the book.But some things just can't be transferred to the silver screen. The book has a few third person perspectives that really add to the feel of the tangled tale not to mention the overall story that I believe Martin is trying to tell. Knowing some things before hand can cause the book to feel like a doomed march to destruction, an illusion that Martin meticulously suspends-- until the silent sword is already swung catching the reader unawares and doubtless unprepared on several occasions. Besides, the series will rob you of the opportunity of imagining some of the characters-- personally, my favorite part of reading books like this.Overall this book is a 5 Commendable Yarn. I say 5 because I stayed up until 2am on several nights reading, the consequences of a tired day with twins to come be hanged. That and I am telling absolute strangers to read this book. I am hooked. I am trying to pace myself so that I don't finish the books too soon before the next one comes out, but I started Clash of Kings yesterday and am halfway through...\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"2"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Modern Classic\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I don't think there is anything left unsaid about this book or series.

I read the Hobbit in school, The Dark Elf Trilogy sometimes after that, and Lord of the Rings when the films came out. I am, however, an avid reader in general and was shocked when I was this great ad for a new HBO show based on a best selling series and had never heard of it.Elves, Dragons, Wizards, and Dwarves and all I decided to venture from my comfort zone and give it a shot. If this sounds like you so far read no further. Just read the book without a knowledge in the world about it. Then come back and see if you agree.If you've done that or are just looking for a general review, there is only one word for it. Epic. Not as in \"I just teabaged the leader in Halo\" epic, but as in The Odyssey epic. And it's not so much fantasy as altered history. The fantasy stuff is always somewhere lurking in the back, threatening your comfort zone but keeping a respectful distance. Then you start to become curious about it's ways as it slowly creeps in. Before you know it, you want less and less lords and ladies, and more and more demons and beasts.Now, you may have heard the series has morally grey characters, multiple plot lines, and shocking twists by now. You may thing between your Pulp Fictions and Sixth Senses and network television you may have gotten used to some of those things by now. But no, believe me you haven't.Characters aren't just grey, they're real....but in their own world. They reflect both larger ideas of behavior, mixed with unique and well sustained character traits, wrapped up in the unique attributes of their fictional world. They're real, but in their own ways. It also helps lend creedence to old re-used characters like the hardened veteran, the good knight, the noble hero, and the men turned to redemption by making them as interesting as they were when you first saw them in youth.And plot-lines aren't just multiple, they are interwoven and richly detailed featuring a host of interesting characters. The only thing better than when they all work together, is when they start to branch in their own unique directions. George R.R. Martin weaves a tapestry of the finest plot threads here, and leaves you dangling on every new verse and character. With every new chapter comes a new perspective and a new way to look a the world. It's a unique structure that is a little challenging at first, but pays off richly in the end. Plus hey, if Martin was going to create a detailed new landscape, why not explore all of it?Finally those twists. All I'll say is this. You haven't guessed them. Sure you're smart and too cool to be fooled, and you may have guessed a couple of them, but don't get cocky kid. You have no idea what's coming. Because it's not just great big twists, it's little developments along the way. The \"shocking reveal\" isn't just used for the endgame but rather keeps the story fresh and moving along through all of it's exciting escapades. My jaw literally dropped while reading this book, and I highly doubt I'm unique in that.Overall, not only is this a great book but it kicks off a fantastic series. That said though, I could see this one easily becoming most peoples favorite. Later works can get bogged down in details and side stories, therefore requiring a little slogging to get through. This first installment, however, is as tight as it is intricate. The pages fly by and you read on just to see what happens next to your favorite character (an ingenious by product of the design). Worth a read on ever conceivable mature reading level, Game of Thrones as a single book ranks among the best fantasy works ever produced and could go toe to toe with any traditional novel out there for sheer entertainment.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The best-written and most realistic characters I've ever encountered.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Please note: I haven't watched the TV show yet, so this is a review purely based on the book.DESCRIPTION:  In a world where seasons last for years or even decades at a time, at the end of the longest summer ever recorded, Winter is slowly approaching at last - and not only the season! The kingdom of Westeros is in a world of trouble, though most of them do not know it. Far to the North, beyond the Wall, strange and supernatural forces are stirring, while to the South, an exiled princess comes into her power and gathers her forces to reclaim the throne that was usurped from her family.REVIEW: Following a vast cast of characters, A Game of Thrones chronicles both the political and social games played for the acquisition and conservation of power and the personal lives of the various players in this game.The main focus is on the Stark family, Wardens of the North and descendents of the Old People, who reside in their citadel in the far North just below the Wall, Winterfell. Neddard Stark is a man of honour, integrity and loyalty, so when his boyhood friend and king asks him to come south to become his Hand after the death of the previous Hand, Ned has no choice but to agree.Leaving his sons (one of whom was grievously injured when he discovered a deadly secret while the King visited at Winterfell) and devoted wife behind, Ned and his two daughters must join the King's party at King's Landing, where feasting and tournaments drain the treasury more every day, corruption and betrayal are part of the day-to-day court mechanics and the population is becoming increasingly impoverished and desperate.Further, the court at King's Landing is seeping with poison and no one is who they seem to be. Soon mired in politics he is ill-suited to navigate with his honesty and integrity intact, Ned finds himself fighting for his own life and the lives of his daughters while his wife must fight for those of their other children.Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow is sworn into the Brotherhood who guards the Wall; an oath for life where desertion leads to death but remaining to serve may lead to even worse. The undermanned and overwhelmed contingent of soldiers is made up mostly of criminals forced to take the life-long oaths as a form of community service, and most of them no longer believe in the dangers that lurk in the Northern snows - that is until Jon's uncle, Ned's Brother, who is First Ranger, leads an expedition beyond the wall to find out the whereabouts of a previous expedition... and never returns.What I like the most about these books is the complexity of the characters. There is not one character that you can purely loathe or purely love. Everyone is doing what they think are the right thing, even though the consequences to others are devastating sometimes. Even though the cast is HUGE, each character has their own, unique personality with flaws, strengths and moments of great weakness and stupidity as well as moments of great strength and nobility.I don't want to spoil the book too much (if I hadn't already ;p), but the complexity of these characters and their interwoven stories, told from the varying limited third person POV really makes this book and this series unique and incredible.There are some flaws, though, no denying that. The chapters are sometimes more like paragraphs, and since each paragraph takes you into the POV of a different character, it takes a while to get used to the abruptness of the transitions and keep track of the million side-plots.There is also a lot of brutality, injustice, gratuitous sex and misogyny and other unpleasant subjects (including rape and infanticide) that are addressed in various ways throughout the story, which can become truly upsetting and triggering. It is certainly not everyone's cup of tea.Also, if you are a believer of easy morality, moral absolutes and a \"good guys are good and pure and wear untarnished white and bad guys are evil and irredeemable and rotten to the core\" kind of reader, this is CERTAINLY not the series for you.That being said, reading this book and living through these incredibly diverse and real characters and the complexities of things like morality, accountability, and power was one fantastic experience - an experience that left me a better and more empathetic and tolerant person.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you already love the TV show...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This review is for: People who love the TV series GAME OF THRONES and are considering reading the books as well.In fact, let me be a little more specific. I tried reading A GAME OF THRONES several times before the show started and didn't make it more than a couple chapters before giving up. During those initial attempts, my thoughts about the book could be summed up as \"Yawn,\" and \"Ugh.\"I didn't even like the HBO show at first. Season 1 struck me as okay. Good enough. Fine. I mean, you know, I watched it, so it wasn't terrible. Season 2 is what hooked me, and it hooked me good. All of a sudden I cared about everything. About the characters -- all the characters! -- and the world and the plot. I was fascinated by every little aspect of Westeros and I wanted more.So I picked up the book again, and I loved it.Obvious warning here: if you don't want to be spoiled, don't read any more of my review.So, first off: I'd heard that the HBO show follows the book pretty faithfully. For Season 1/Book 1, this is true. The HBO show covers all the main events in the book, so don't expect to be surprised, or even to hunt down side-stories or 'deleted scenes'. There really isn't much.On the other hand, I was surprised by how different characters in the book could be from the same character in the TV show, even though they're doing the same things & often speaking the same lines. I didn't pay much attention to Bran during Season 1 -- I couldn't have told you what his name was -- but he leapt off the page for me in the book; I loved his chapters. I've been mostly indifferent to Jon Snow in the show; the actor strikes me as sort of wooden and dull. But I adored Jon Snow in the book; he's funnier, more likable, and full of angst.And...the biggest surprise of all...I didn't like Ned Stark in the book. I loved Sean Bean as Ned Stark. He was so grizzled and fierce and stoic and wise. On the show, his execution struck me as a tragedy. But the Ned Stark of the book seemed provincial, complacent, a poor observer. In the book, I saw the hubris that forecasts a terrible fall. His death seemed less tragic, more inevitable.In fact, when you read with the benefit of hindsight, it's fascinating to see how often a character will make a decision whose TERRIBLE outcome you already know, and then another character will say, \"Hey, maybe you should rethink that decision, things could go wrong in a TERRIBLE way,\" and then the first character will say, \"Yep,\" and carry on. It's amazing how utterly BELIEVABLE it is that this happens, time and time again. It feels true to life, but it's only possible because the characters are fully-fleshed, and the conflicts they face are so dire.To sum up: don't read for new plot, it's all in the show. DO read to get a different perspective on the characters.DO read if you want to go deeper into the worldbuilding. For example: in the show, it's clear that some people follow the 'old gods' and some the 'seven gods' and then there's the 'one god'. If you want to know why some people follow one religion and others a different one, the book lays it out. If you want to know where Littlefinger got his nickname, if you want hints about who Jon Snow's parents are, if you totally didn't realize that 'The Dog' and 'The Mountain' are brothers who hate one another...the book DOES fill in a lot of details along these lines, and I loved the backstory. It was exactly the sort of thing I'd been craving.I'll tell you something else. I LOVE the HBO show Game of Thrones. Love it. The characters are vivid, the story is crisp and brisk -- I regularly scream or gasp or do some other embarrassing thing at the end of an episode.But the book was more impressive to me. It wasn't until I READ it that I got a handle on how many plots and characters and landscapes GRR Martin is juggling. How huge in scope, how intricately worked out this series is -- the plots, the characters, the places. It is all so present and real, and it all feels IMPORTANT.The show feels pretty epic. The book even moreso.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Don't Reinvent The Wheel, Mr. Martin\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Premise:George R. R. Martin's \"Song of Fire and Ice\" series was a fresh start after I had to finished the most-current Robert Jordan book (many books ago now). Like many (many) others, I picked up the book. The length didn't scare me, especially coming off the back nine of Robert Jordan's epic, so I felt a treat was awaiting me. This treat quickly turned sour, and no sooner than the first quarter of the book.Prologue:I don't want to start by tearing the book into pieces at first because I think something should be said: many reviews have mentioned that the \"writing was excellent\", yet they state examples of how they hate the writing; and I don't want to fall into that trap. The \"writing\" isn't what is good here. What Mr. Martin has done for us is take a simple twist on telling his epic. Instead of blundering through plot-by-plot steps, even disconnected plots at times, he does so through the eyes of \"Point-of-View\" characters. On top of this, his finesse in creating believable dialogue is wondrous. These are merits, and worthy of recognition. Bravo, Mr. Martin. I do applaud your brilliance in that arena. However, it is in the other aspects of \"writing\" that you have failed, and sadly, in a *very* important aspect.The Torn Pieces:A Game Of Thrones started out with amazing potential. The \"Others\" were a great concept that Martin invented to enthrall our imaginations, like fantasy novels do, but what he fails to make them a \"clan\" of importance. Once we get a taste of them, we never see from them again. In addition, we are introduced to a sudden political sub-plot, as it were to be. Ah, but there lies the problem... We aren't in a sub-plot, we have been introduced the *real* plot instead. I won't throw the book down yet because I have not read enough to really know exactly what is going on, especially as the characters are only slowly developing, but I can see quickly that the \"fear\" of the Others is less of a concern to anyone who was in the novel.After trying to endlessly battle whether the Others were a \"hidden\" threat in hope of a grandiose and epic ending to the first novel, I instead keep going deeper and deeper into a story about bastard children that has little to do with anything at all. After nearly 300 pages of reading, we learn that no one is pure. Everyone, even the purest, are doused in unholy thoughts and illegal behavior. Morals and ethics have no place in this novel, and it immediately made me think otherwise about finishing it. But again, I felt I should continue believing things where only building (as most good books do build many different plots and oddities together into a perplexing climax). I was still stumped, another few hundred pages down the rabbit hole...One day I picked up the book to see that I was more than half way done, but I could not remember any memorable parts that could be identifiable as \"sections\" or closed plot section. All the links from the plot are muddled into an ambiguous political drama where each character plays out the hero, villain, and idiot. A soap opera, if you didn't know what that was. To make matters worse, the characters I pegged as heroes from the start of the book were all killed off. Now, I have no problems killing characters (and a good author does so in a way to build others characters, or strike a good turning point in the story), but Martin literally just decides to go \"Um, you die now\" out of thin air. He waves his magical hand over the paper, and suddenly 10 chapters of the book have become pointless jibberish of character development that really never mattered at all. This is probably one of the largest portions of his \"writing\" that he failed to learn about: You don't invest so much time and real estate (portion size based on novel size) building a character that is to be killed quickly. A good debater would argue that Martin wanted to make even his smaller characters have depth, but I would still argue that less focus and smaller amount of space would have simply done the job.I continue on the rant about characters because it is vitally important. Here though, I want to address to the characters themselves. And again, I want to make a premising statement: Martin has done no \"copy cat\" of his characters. If the man were to sit down and create blank characters from scratch to write a politics-driven story from, I would imagine that *every* character would have been seem at least once before from *any* preceding work even remotely based on the subject matter. It's not impossible to create new and interesting characters, but to imagine that every author is going to have that amazing imagination, then I fear we will all be waiting for the second coming of Jesus. With that said, Martin does fail again at even attempting to make the reader guess as something called \"motive\". Every person in real life has a motive, and in general, they are never the same as someone else. Even those who seem almost identical may in fact be trying to accomplish the same task for two completely different reasons. Martin does not begin to let us think that's the case. Each of his characters was early-on identified as a Hero or a Villain. And in no particular way did he try to disguise the situation. It's not unheard of to know the heroes and villains beforehand in a politically-driven plot, as the mystery to learn the truth is a driving point, but again, Martin fails to do so by giving it away in the first quarter of the book. He hands you the villains, then shows you the mystery, and flashes it all away into a mindless jumble of awkwardness for another couple hundred pages of idiocracy.I've spoken of the mis-plot that Martin plots, then I spoke of the wasted space used to develop dead characters, and then I spoke of removing the mystery from the plot. What else can I say about this book? Lots.First, let's not forget that another sub-plot (or is it the main plot in disguise?) is revolving around a group of people who fear ships living an ocean away who want to eventually be led by an unwise and stupid leader striking out solely with revenge. Although pundits will chime in to say \"Martin has three distinct plots to eventually diverge together, so it's not a subplot, it's part of the main plot\"... guess what, it's not. *Spoiler alert* Four books later, and it's not happened yet.*End Alert* I hate to go on with this one because it almost speaks for itself. Same as half the characters he created for the story. I've given Martin the benefit-of-the-doubt that he wanted to create unique characters, but he didn't try to make unique enough. It was no stretch of the imagination that every character did what I was expecting them to do, simply because it was obvious in their actions/dialogue. With all of the amazingly wasted character depth created for dead characters, Martin could have filled his novel with more dynamic situations and characters who he planned to evolve over the course of the series.Second, where's the magic and fantasy that this novel's culture takes claim too? We are merely teased with \"dragons\" and brief mentions of \"magic\", but Martin does not deliver. Not once (until later novels) do Dragons even enter the world. In addition, the minor \"magical tricks\" that are employed are mind-numbingly stupid. The time it takes to wait on any real fantasy to happen, I'd be an old man dead and long gone.In conclusion, since you have potentially forgotten many things here: Martin has the potential to be a grand writer. His dialogue and creative intent at skipping the traditional way to tell a story lend to an amazing basis of a writer, but he has to learn how to develop characters in a way that the reader is not being told what he/she is/are doing, but learns it from their interactions with the other characters; and in the same vein, to not develop characters that will be suddenly killed. Also, a dose of uniqueness to brighten up the carbon-copy characters that Martin may-or-may-not-have stolen, but created for his world, would help readers identify them to his story rather than constantly asking the question \"Where do I remember this person from?\"\\n  \\n","3":"2.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Possibly the best of Fantasy in the last 20 years\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I spent quite a while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with a fitting description of A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin.  Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope?  Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view?  Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well.  How could I do such a work justice?I might as well get this part out of the way first.  Obligatory Synopsis:  in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming.  Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces.  At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne.  All this is told through the various stories of both \"good guys\" and not-so-good guys.For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it).  The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style.  Martin has perfected what Jordan had arguably introduced; the multiple characters' points of view telling the vast saga on an intimate, up-close scale.  Never did I feel that I was being strung along, but rather lead by increments toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead.  Martin builds the suspense masterfully in each book.But by far the most striking thing about the Song of Ice and Fire is the \"rules\" that the author breaks.  Martin is not afraid to tell the tale from the point of view of some very unlikable, even immoral characters.  He is bold about revealing facts from a character's past that challenge one's impressions and assumptions about their ethics.  He does not lay all his cards on the table up front, but rather unexpectedly reveals details that later change the whole picture and twist the plot admirably.  And his most unusual move: this author even allows \"favorites\" to die occasionally (no names here...)!  These risks pay off well to serve the story as a whole, bring a sense of true humanity to the people of this world and drive the reader on to the next series installment.It's just too bad that I can't magically transplant my sense of admiration for AGOT onto this page.  Hopefully, you are intrigued enough to give it a try; it would be a shame to miss what IMHO could be the best series of the decade.-Andrea, aka Merribelle\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Read twice\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent read only took me three days I loved it so much.

They're well written with elegant articulation and beautiful descriptions. The plot is thought out and complex just like any good book should be, the characters have a lot of personality like any good character should have, and there's enough of a storyline to keep a very lengthy book interesting. I like that there are so many character POVs but nothing seems overdone at all. Each storyline and each character has their own separate life that the book portrays and they all have enough scattered chapters through the book that you never forget what's happening with a certain character.That being said...I have read books 1-5 and pretty much the only thing that has disappointed me - and greatly - is the injustice to the protagonistic family done by the antagonistic family. We'll call them family PRO and Family ANTI for protagonistic and antagonistic. The Anti-family has done atrocious - and I mean ATROCIOUS, not just running a dog over and urinating in your soup atrocious but I won't use specifics as to spoil anything - things to this family. These are devastating things that make me sympathize with the Pro-family, things that make me loathe the Anti-family and yearn for justice yet... it seems that the Pro-family just keeps suffering and the Anti-family continues to flourish gaining more power, wealth, and malice. The pro-family sees tragedy after tragedy for standing up to Anti-family. I keep waiting for the Pro-family to get at least a little bit of justice, just to make the books tolerable. Just a morsel, a smidgen of reprieve from this horrible life they've been condemned to but after five books they've had almost all their opportunities to get the right amount of injustice taken away from them. For them to get their much-deserved retribution they'd need to have A, B, C, D, E, F, and G killed, maimed, humiliated, overthrown, mauled, slaughtered, flayed, (enter your own ideas of the most horrific scenarios and enter some explicits and you might have an idea of what this family needs - and me too, to be satisfied) but with so many events chances of justice and ways that they deserve justice has been reduced to only options A and B. Seriously, I'm so disappointed at how the things I've been looking forward to reading in this book keep getting ripped out of the Pro-family's (and my own) hands.Other than that, though, this book moves fairly quickly, the plot furthers at a decent speed, there is just enough action and plot to keep it from being overdone or underdone.WARNING, SPOILER ALERT: I'd like to add, too, that my favorite part of the book is the Others and they've been only a minute part of this book. I watched the pilot of GoTs before I read the books and the very first five or so minutes when they showed the White Walkers hooked me and easily became my favorite part, and this has only been about two percent of the book. I'd love to read more on these things. Being that book six is supposedly the last one, and the really wicked things haven't even really made their debut I'm wondering if they'll get to do so in book six. They're like a threat that's been looming over human-kind unbeknownst to them, and no one believes they're going to be making their much-awaited appearance to the whole world. No one believes they'll be coming back.So, if I had the chance to beg anything of the fantastic author, it would be to give the family their much-deserved revenge and make the Others a huge part of book six.

Those who haven't read it or ever heard of it now wish to read it and those that want nothing to do with the books eagerly await the TV series or ask those who have read the books what happens next.  A Game of Thrones, although the title for the TV show, is only the first book in a seven part series of which only five books are currently released.When George R.R. Martin first published A Game of Thrones very few people outside of the die hard fantasy fiends thought of picking it up.  Topping close to 1,000 pages, with extensive geologies, hundreds of characters, and a plot thick with political intrigue it is a difficult book to sit down and get through.  The character set ups alone can be daunting since GrrM has this particular interest in making every character a round character.  However, once you are past that hurdle, the book is an absolute diamond among recent fantasy novels.The story, the characters, the landscape, the hints at magic, the political channeling throughout, the dialog, the creatures, the cities, all of it is enrapturing and once you take a hold of this book it will be difficult to put down.  GrrM captures the essence of humanity and shows us the process of being as dynamic as reality.  The characters are loved and hated all at once, the story makes us question our own judgment, and the events tear at our hearts or harden them.  A TV show cannot properly convey such depth since something like that takes quite a deal of time and energy, but Martin is sure to make us feel this way within the story itself.It almost needs no introduction after the sensational HBO series, but it does require some guidance for those who have not heard of it despite the cultural giant it has become.  The Stark family take the front stage in this book and win our hearts with their old world pride, honor, and dignity.  They are from a cold, harsh land, the first major castle and town south of the infamous Wall which is the land's metaphorical boogeyman behind the closet doors.  Eddard and Catelyn Stark along with their children, including but not limited to a bastard son, are swept into the political way of life when their King, Robert Baratheon, requests Eddard to sit on the High Council as Hand of the King.  Essentially, Eddard, or Ned, will help rule (more like just plain run) the kingdom's affairs in far off, southerly, King's Landing.  What follows is an ever-flowering rose that is hardly fragrant and hardly polite.  The world shifts and the Game of Thornes begins.Absolutely worth the read, beyond any shadow of a doubt.  My only recommendation is that if you are NOT the strongest reader or you are leery of beginning the book what with the flood of characters to digest then watch the first couple episodes in the TV series.  That will help to insure that you will know exactly who is important and who isn't in the grander scheme of things.  Though I usually do not make such a recommendation, it will help if you feel that you need it.  Otherwise, plow through and I promise that those that are important will definitely shine as you pursue this absolutely groundbreaking, unforgettable beginning to an ever-evolving tale.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"3"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you like the HBO series...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you like the HBO series, you will not be disappointed here. This first book corresponds to the 1st season of Game of Thrones. It is nearly exactly the same with a few interesting differences which I liked, and there is more details on the history of Westeros. The sex scenes in the book are somehow more graphic than the show but nothing that an adult can't handle (not for kids)!So I am not a big reader. I hated it when I was forced to read in school and have done a good job of avoiding serious reading save for magazines and news articles. It probably has to do with the fact that I am a slow reader. When I learned there was a book series that the TV show was based on I was interested to look into it. But when I saw just how long the books where, I just knew darn well I wouldn't read it. But the further I got into the show, the more interested I got in the maybe giving the books a try. Finally I downloaded the Kindle sample and it didn't take long to be hooked.For those that haven't seen the show but are interested in the books:The setting is a place and time like medieval Britain. The story follows a handful of great and formerly-great houses in their struggle with love and honor and power. It is a fantasy, but that is not the major part, at least not in this first book. The characters are humans and their life-struggles are those of all humans. The fantasy element is somewhat on the fringes but is there, so it may be more accessible to those weary of learning fantasy worlds like Tolkien's, like myself. The sex and violence is quite graphic and Martin's descriptions of battles is wonderfully vivid, something Tolkien skimps on in The Hobbit; I haven't finished the Lord of the Rings so I can't comment on the comparison there. If you are someone like me who got bogged down in the first book of the LOTR series, this is much easier to read and more engaging throughout. There are multiple stories line occurring all at once and Martin switches between them with every new chapter so it takes some getting used to but they are now hard to follow. The prologue was very confusing (and I've seen the show) so get through it because it sets a scene and you will understand it later. And WARNING, as I was warned prior to watching the show or reading the books, Martin has no loyalties to characters. You will love Martin one minute and curse him the next. If you want a story where the main character/hero triumphs of evil, honor over dishonor, do not read this book. But that is what makes the story so interesting: it's like the real world we live in, evil often triumphs.As for the Kindle edition:I have the both the Kindle and the paperback editions. I always have my phone on me but not always the hard copy so they serve 2 different purposes. I am someone how does like the feel of a book (I know, I know. I said I don't read... Nonetheless). As far as I can tell there are no differences. Even the art at the beginning of each chapter is the same. I switch seamlessly between the two.So in summary, I loved it. I would recommend it to everyone, even to adults who don't read much. It's a great story covered in sex and war… what's not to love!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Most Intelligent and Intriguing Fantasy Book I've Read Yet (other than LotR)\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was going to rate this book 4/5 but then I realized that if a book is worth a five it should be given a five regardless if it has flaws.

Five/Five stars, Ten/Five stars, Twenty/Five stars.The Good:As in my review title I think this book is hands down one of the most intelligent fantasy books I've yet read apart from the Lord of the Rings series. The corruption, the plot twists, the betrayal, the treason, the death, the war, the love, the struggle, the brotherhood, the symbolism, the character detail, the world detail, and the gigantic scope set up for this series is all top notch. It's almost Shakespearean tragedy, in a way, done in a contemporary style. I don't know if I've known in any other modern fantasy so many real and deep characters. I feel like I can empathize most and visualize them completely (even ones without a written point of view). Martin also does an incredible job of keeping the reader on track with the separate story-lines as each comes back to itself after an absence.So on and so forth, all the wonderful comments made by every other five-star reviewer.The Bad:Unfortunately there's one thing Martin seems to have a continual habit of doing in this book (and I hope not the rest in the series) which is forgetting his point of view - just for little sentences here and there. I'm almost certain there is at least one time in each chapter where he writes a sentence explaining something (a thought, a look, some detail, etc) that the current point of view could not know. Maybe I'm just picking nits or looking too closely, not looking closely enough, but over and over this writing flaw nagged - never very much, like I said one sentence in a chapter maybe two, but it was consistent through the entire novel.Also small parts of the world I couldn't visualize completely: how do they measure years when seasons are multiple years long? or how does a world have such variable seasonal patterns? Are there miniature seasons that occur to follow a complete annual pattern underneath the greater climate change? Obviously I'm not asking Martin to provide a scientific answer to his world climate, but little things fit easily enough - change in harvests, other celestial bodies, etc that make the world make that much more sense. The former especially can be used merely in passing but provide a major world-explaining detail.The last complaint I have (which other reviewers have mentioned) is that though the bulk of the story is very adult and a major theme seems to be loss of innocence, the sex in a number of cases seems very adolescent. I believe Martin makes an effort to be mature and succeeds at least once or twice (Catelyn's sex scenes and how he writes of Lord's bastards) sometimes it falls flat and tears me out of the story (most often concerning Daenerys). However it is fully possible I hold my standards higher than most.These three details I choose to point out are ultimately negligible in face of what actually makes this book so good. They are nitpicks and can be easily overlooked/forgotten within the same page they occur.Read it, it's worth the money especially if you buy it used. I'm going to read the series in its entirety but I would be just as satisfied having read only this first novel.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Spectacular series, Kindle version needs to be proof-read.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have enjoyed Mr. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series for quite a long time. I have read and re-read all of the books many times, and they never get old.Now I have all of the books in paperback, but I decided to get the Kindle version for my iPhone library. As much as I love the books I couldn't help but be annoyed. It seems that the Kindle version wasn't proof-read or spell-checked at all. There are so many spelling mistakes in it that my eyes glazed over at points. not just a few mistakes, but as many as two or three every few pages. For example, I am about 3/4 or so through the book and I have only seen the country of Dorne spelled correctly once. Every other time it is for some reason spelled Dome. There are numerous times when in one sentence a character's name is spelled correctly, and two sentences later the name is misspelled. There's also randomly inserted punctuations like brackets where there shouldn't be, and some punctuation is missing or wrong (A missing ' in a contraction or a ! in place of a ?). Also for some reason there are some words that are italic that should not be...I downloaded both Game of Thrones and it's sequel, A Clash of Kings. I really hope Clash isn't as bad. I still enjoyed the Game of Thrones Kindle version due to it's convenience and what-not but the constant mistakes do get fairly annoying.Thats just my take on the Kindle eBook aspect of this.The book itself is spectacular. If you are looking for a Tolkien-esque fantasy then you are looking in the wrong place. The pure evil in this world is pretty much just  a whisper from the north. An after-thought to the main points of the story. This is a gritty, no holds barred tale of medieval life. Rape and violence, death and betrayal.Younger readers and people looking for the standard feel good, pure good versus pure evil fantasy trash will not like this series. This is a much more realistic world set in a medieval-like time period, not a pretty story with perfect-featured elves and a bad guy intent on destroying the world even though he is living in said world. There is no little piece of gold jewelry that needs to be destroyed to save the world. If a character you care about in the series dies he will not be coming back. A main character will not take one lesson at swordplay and suddenly be a master swordsman. Nor will he gain an undefeatable magic power.One thing to note as well is Mr. Martin's writing style in these books. he doesnt just focus on one or three character's point of view. Each chapter in these books is told from the point of view of a different character. One chapter will be from the point of view of John Snow, then next will by Tyrion Lannister, then Arya Stark, then back again to John Snow. Some people may not like it, annoyed that the eyes they are looking (reading) from changes so constantly. Personally I like it. You get to know all of these character's more and more. You see from their eyes instead of them being just a name viewed by the main character.A warning, there are 4 books in the series, the 5th coming out relatively soon (we all hope) but George has said that he will NOT release a book unless he is satisfied with it. Deadlines do not matter in the face of quality, and if the book is not up to snuff he will not release it until it is. Supposedly there will be 7 books total. There have been some long waits in between the books already out so do not expect the next volumes to be coming out annually, or even bi-annually. They will come out when they come out.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Thoughts on Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One Audio book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Thoughts on Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One[Audio book, Unabridged] [Audio CD]George R.R.

Roy Dotrice does a phenomenal job of reading and imbuing each character with a distinct voice. This is very impressive for a series with so many characters. The audio itself is well recorded, crisp and clear and picks up the different intonations of Dotrice perfectly.This is the kind of audio book I like - unabridged, the entire original book. Read word for word. With appropriate vocal modulations to help you keep characters straight when listening. I found it much easier to keep track of who was doing what where from the audio book than I did the HBO series (which cuts \"a bit\" too much in some parts.)I have listened to some of the \"fully dramatized\" versions of audio books. Most notably I listened to the BBC's dramatized versions of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. I have not enjoyed them as much as the straight unabridged versions, as in order to \"fully dramatize\" there are usually sound effects, music, and worse modification of the text of the book to fit the story into more of an audio-play format. Given I am a fan of the original source material, whenever there is something dropped or added from the text, it jars my suspension of disbelief and takes me out of the book.Roy Dotrice treads a fine line. He does give each character a unique voice, and \"acts\" the books. But there is not any distracting music or sound effects, and Mr. Dotrice sticks to the source word for word. His narration of the book is spot on and absorbing. What's more, my wife, who is not as much of a Fantasy fan as I am, also found it absorbing and can't wait for the next chapter and next book.The number of books in the series is another big plus. Mr. Dotrice has recorded not just the first book, but the first five books in the series all unabridged. My wife and I look forward to listening to all of them. It is our hope he continues and does books 6 and 7 as soon as George R.R. Martin completes them.If you like fantasy novels, character driven stories, or stories told from a character (or different characters' perspectives), I highly recommend Game of Thrones. If you want to watch some great drama on TV, try the TV version (or try Battlestar Galactica or The Walking Dead). If you want to listen to a great story told well... try the audio book version. They are all good and worth owning and reading, watching, or listening to.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Effortless\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    When I ordered the GOT book 1...

Martin and the world of Westeros.Frankly, I had never heard of Martin nor his books before a friend encouraged me to watch the HBO production of A Game of Thrones. I'm still trying to figure out why the series clicked with me, but it did. So, too, did the first book in the series. I managed to read through the book in a week, something that I can rarely do with an 800-plus page book. By the time I finished, my preconceptions about fantasy novels had been shattered. I've even jumped straight into the second book of the series, so anixous to continue the plot threads of so many richly drawn characters laid out in the opening book of the series.To be sure, there are some fantasy elements to the book such as references to dragons, white walkers (who seem to be a bit like vampires) and the Little People of the Forest (perhaps the faerie folk?). But the emphasis is on the human characters. These aren't the type of characters you can group into Good and Evil camps. The best and most noble of characters can do bad things and the worst characters can surprise you by doing the right things sometimes. These are fully realized human characters in all their glorious shades of gray.It often seems that the \"magic\" overshadows the human elements in fantasies, but in A Game of Thrones it seems this \"rule\" has been turned on its head. There are no hair-breadth escapes with the aid of a magic wand or an incantation. Swords don't glow with magical intent. The people of the north may still go to sacred groves to talk to their gods, but if the gods choose to answer it is not with any sort of human voice. In other words, the tale holds together on a rational level without resorting to supernatural intervention.Even though some plot points may require a leap of faith, I found myself willing to make that leap with Martin and his characters. Oh sure, there are elements I still scratch my head over, like how winter can be brief or last for a decade or how the humans can trace their history back thousands of years but seem to progress so slowly when it comes to technology and innovation. Perhaps these questions will be answered later in the series, but for now I'm intent to experience Westeros as Martin intended it.Perhaps there will come a time as I read further into the series when I come to a point and say \"Oh, that's preposterous!\" and put the series down never to return. But for now I've gone farther than I ever imagined I would with the series and hope to go even further. What I do know is that if all \"fantasies\" were this detailed and grounded in a more real world, I would have been a fan long ago.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Game of Waiting\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    There isnt much more to say that hasnt already been said about this fantastic series.  The only point I'll make is when I decided to read this series the first three books were on the market with the remaining books still unwritten or not published yet.  I typically don't like to start reading multi-book sagas that are unfinished because I hate the thought of investing time in something that has no end yet because a) the author may get distracted by other projects and never finish the series b) the series will finish on a disappointing note leaving the faithful readers with an unsatisfied conclusion or c) the series will be completed but it will take eons for it to be written and published.  Some readers may actually enjoy the uncertainty and the wait and I respect that.  For example, Harry Potter fans have stuck with the series book by book but it seems to me that those books were written and published on a regular interval and has recently concluded with much fanfare.  This series is a bit different in that no one has any idea when the next installment will be released and the end is not in sight.  Having said that I still decided to pick up the first three books based on the rave reviews and read each one with great dedication. My thinking was that as I read the first three books, the fourth will be published and the fifth would follow shortly thereafter.  Now I'm regretting my decision because its been a few years since I finished Book 3.  Book 4 is out now and has gotten mixed reviews (see b above).  The series has expanded to a 6th book and there is no target date in the near or distant future for them(see a and c above).  So before you decide to spend your time reading these books think about whether your ok with the three scenarios mentioned earlier.  If you are then go for it and enjoy as it is certainly one of the finer fantasy reads out there (for the first three books).  If not, then I would think twice before diving in.UPDATE (Sept 2008) - Nothing has changed.  Still waiting for Book 5 and no one (including the author according to his webite) has any inkling when it will ever be finished.  Of course, when or if the book is ever completed thats not even the end of the series.  There's still another book that has to be written!  I'll check back in a few years...maybe by then Book 5 will have been released and then everyone will be playing the waiting game for Book 6.UPDATE (Nov 2009) - Out of morbid curiousity I decided to check in to see if Book 5 had been released yet or if there was an anticipated release date.  I am not surprised that the answer is NO and there is no hope in sight.  The good news is that the Fire and Ice books which I read a long time ago are a distant memory meaning that I really don't remember much about the storylines, plots or characters anymore and consequently I'm happy to say I have no attachment to this series anymore.  Even if Book 5 came out next week and got rave reviews (highly unlikely) I would not read it because I would be setting myself up for another long, drawn out wait for the next installment.  No thanks, I'll pass.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The best epic fantasy yet... A mere 5 stars doesn't do it justice.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you're like me, you expect a \"good\" book to rate highly in three areas: 1. Plot  2. Characters  3. World-buildingIf a book gets high marks in these three areas, I find that it makes for an interesting read, even after multiple read-throughs.  When I read AGoT (and the rest of the currently-published books in the series) GRRM not only ranked high in those areas, but he blew me out of the water.1. Plot:  Very unpredictable and not the typical \"quest\" theme seen in most fantasy.  It is also multilayered, with plots going on from several points of view (the different plots ARE interconnected as well.  This keeps it interesting even when some plot lines get slow-paced at times.2. Characters:  Very, very realistic characters with personal, family, and political issues.  GRRM also takes the time to make the major characters 3-D.  You discover more about each character's backstory as the book (and series) progresses.  Also, characters GROW and Change, much like real people.  BE WARNED- not all of the characters make it to the end, some die untimely deaths (as in real life).3. World-building:  With a cast of hundreds of characters, all belonging to various families, areas of the country, etc. you get to see a lot of the landscape, buildings, and political atmosphere that exists.  You also get a lot of backstory (myths, history, etc) on the land.  GRRM also does a good job of describing the various cultures that exist.  Another great perk GRRM gives us is descriptions of foods and the characters' opinions of them (I love seeing a foodie, like myself, as a main character).Some things to keep in mind...-  There is a good amount of sex, language, and violence in the ASoIaF series...as there is in real life.  If you are not a fan of gritty reality this might not be the series for you...Although it might be worth a try, even if you end up skimming the grittier parts.-  Don't get too attached to your characters.  If you're the type that attaches to a single character and then feel crushed/devastated when they die, this might not be the series for you.-  If you don't like long books, series, or cliff hangers...this might not be the series for you.  The books are long, the plot is vast (with many cliffhangers), and the series, it is not yet finished.  So be warned...It can be a very long wait when you reach the end of the last published book in the series and then have to wait for the next one to come out.-  if you're into very fantastical fantasy (i.e. magical wizards, spells, and charms everywhere or lots of direct diety intervention), this might not be the series for you.  I think of it as more \"historically based\" fiction, with just enough magic/myth thrown in to keep you (and the characters) guessing whether or not supernatural stuff really is going on.-  Finally, if you hate dialogue and are prone to skimming between action-packed battle scenes...this is definately not the book/series for you.  Believe me, there is a heap of fighting/action going on in this series.  BUT there is also a lot of important dialogue, plotting, and intrigue.  If you skip any of that dialogue, etc.  You will be clueless later in the book/series because of how complicated the plot/s is/are.In closing... READ IT! and you won't be sorry!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Epic.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    That was epic.I first heard about Game of Thrones from the TV series. I watched Season One, and a little bit of Season Two. To be honest, I really REALLY wanted to like it. But hard as I tried, I couldn't get into it; everything was just so confusing, and there were way too many characters and plot lines to follow. I gave up after the third or fourth episode of Season Two.Then, people started talking about how much better the book is. I still really REALLY wanted to like it, so I decided to give it a read.Those people were right. As is typically the case, the book is about a thousand times better than the TV series. There are still lots of characters, and many different plot lines. In fact, there are more sub-plots than there are on TV, but the book goes into so much more detail, that everything just started falling into place. That, and the fact that I'm reading the book at my own pace, and can always page back if I forget who a certain character is, or where he fits into the story.The characters are all instantly memorable, but fair warning: what you've heard about Mr Martin's propensity to kill your favourites off without warning is absolutely true. It makes the world feel more REAL, though, and it's very period-appropriate. One moment you believe that a character's going to be the saviour of the world, and live on throughout the series, and the next there's a jousting accident and he's dead. Gone. Never to be mentioned again.My favourite character, like I think most people's favourite is (whether you're reading the book or watching it on TV), is Tyrion Lannister, the Imp. He was cast perfectly in the TV show, but he's portrayed in even more detail in the book. If you'll indulge me, I'll share a quick quote:\"How would you like to die, Tyrion Lannister?\"\"Peacefully in bed, with a young whore's mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty.\"Something like that. I may have paraphrased.Other things I noticed, that made the world seem more real, and more appropriate to the period, were the ages of the characters. I think they're mentioned on TV, but it's little more than a gloss-over, if I remember correctly. Jon Snow, for example, is fourteen years old when he goes to spend the rest of his life on The Wall. Dany is thirteen on her wedding night, and her husband is something like twenty-five. I understand that stuff like that would be difficult to portray on screen, because of modern sensitivities to things like the age of consent and statutory rape.If you've watched Season One of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy the book, because it contains things that I don't remember seeing on TV. If you haven't, you're even surer to enjoy the book.Oh, one more thing: the book actually ends a little way (probably the third or fourth episode) into Season Two of the TV series. Which happens to be about when I gave up watching, so from here on in, EVERYTHING'S going to be new for me!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Extremely skeptical at first, but grew to love it immensely\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    When I began reading A Game of Thrones I was thoroughly excited.  I had read a great deal of the reviews here and knew mostly what I was getting into.  I was prepared for the multiple points of view setup of the books, and I was prepared for the adult content, both sexual and violent (in fact, the fact that these books were written for an adult audience is one of the main reasons I started reading them).However, about 50 or so pages into AGOT, I was feeling let down.  I had just finished reading a majority of the Sword of Truth series and Feist's Riftwar Saga and was expecting a fairly fantastical fantasy book.  Well, that isn't really what AGOT is.  It focuses more upon the character development, familial relations, and political positioning, and almost ignores any sort of fantastical elements; with Wizards, fantastical creatures, and Magic being merely mentioned in the background.This bothered me for a while because I had it in my head that what I wanted to read about would be at least 50% fantasy and magic.  I stayed the course, however, because of the great reviews and am now thoroughly in love with these books.I actually like it better how GRRM makes magic and fantastical creatures a rare and unusual thing in his world.  Because you rarely read anything to do with magic, when it does come into play, it is more mysterious and entertaining than it would be if it were the main focus of the book.  For anyone that has read the Sword of Truth series, magic is the absolute focus of the book.  In fact, everything else takes a back seat.  However, this makes magic fairly mundane, which I don't think it should be.Furthermore, Martin's writing is absolutely superb.  Not only is every character distinct emotionally, but they are also distant in a familial way.  They all have their own ancestors with their own particular and unique histories.  These histories and family traits play a large part in the characters actions and feelings with which you spend so much time.I've never read a fantasy novel with so much political intrigue, deception, and manipulation, and now I wouldn't want it any other way.  The only flaw I see in the series, not including how long it is taking for the \"fifth\" book to be released, is that Martin's world seems almost too untrustworthy.  Anyone can be killed at any time, however it is usually the good guys that seem to have the worst things happen to them.  Rarely does anything bad happen to the \"villains\" in the story.  With the \"fifth\" book being still a ways off, I don't see any way to wrap this series up without having the bad guys on top in some way.  Now I'm not against realism (having the bad guys win), but I also realize that the bad guys don't always win in reality (probably because there are no \"bad\" guys, only different situations).  This is not really a flaw, just a depressing fact about the books and my lack of imagination with which to see a way out of the pit of despair Martin has dug for his more noble characters.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"4"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Allow your mind to escape from the stereotype of \"Fantasy\"\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I never considered myself an admirer of the whole Fantasy genre. There was always a fine line I would never cross over. However, I think I have stumbled onto something very special with A Game of Thrones and the whole A Song of Ice and Fire series. I was pleasantly surprised with this work. Never have I read a book where the chapters are separated into individual characters points of view, centered around that one character and their whole environment-it was very refreshing and brilliant of the author.I have found a little patience is asked of the potential reader when first entering the world of the Seven Kingdoms. The separate chapters and introductions of key characters may seem never ending, but with some interest and an open \"trusting\" mind follow Mr. Martin into his ever growing epic. However, if you find yourself completely lost with keeping which characters are \"direwolf\", \"lion\", or \"stag\"--flip to the back of the books and discover complete lists of houses, families, alliances, brief descriptions (believe me it will serve the new reader well to reintroduce themselves after finishing one book and moving onto the next).In A Game of Thrones, I overall adored the plot and was fascinated with the research that paid homage to medieval elements: the weapons, clothing, feudal system, battle scenes, war tactics, geography etc. It all just flowed beautifully where you believed you entered into a realistic world with minute touches of whimsy. On the note of \"whimsy\", I am happy, relieved and thankful to report to any interested readers that there were no to a few cliché fantasy characters/species. A Game of Thrones (as well as the whole series) is full of betrayal, adventure, drama, mystery, and classic revenge. I found myself gasping when thrilling and dismal surprises touched heroes and villains alike. Throughout the novel(s) the evidence of \"grey\" characters was an unexpected change from the usual light and dark personalities.The reader will also find that Mr. Martin has a talent to capture and bottle the element of foreshadowing (every \"symbol\" has a meaning that will resurface with a flash and a boom as the reader progresses into the ever growing plot). I must also note that, it has also come to my attention that Mr. Martin has based his brilliant series on actual history or to more specific the Wars of the Roses and possibly even pulls events and pieces from the hardly mentioned Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War- this creates interest, curiosity for many more topics and events to be explored by any potential reader (you will love History again).The only part(s) in this book (and series) that keeps it becoming a solid 5 star rating (for me) are the graphic sex sections and modern vulgar language. At first, I tried to remember history/ancient beliefs, human conditioning from the Medieval stand point and the warped entertainment expectations of today (sadly, sex sells). All of the needless scenes and language all seemed to sum back to something that unfortunately had to be there to push the realism and sell the product. Realism and product marketing aside, I must confess after awhile the graphic scenes and cussing (that seemed to come out of nowhere) started to wear on me and I desperately wished them gone from my vivid imagination. All negative aspects aside, I am very happy I stumbled upon this series and highly recommend for those readers who wish to escape from the stereotype of \"fantasy\".reviewed January 2011, review written 2011\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Do Believe the Hype!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is a great book, but I'm sure that you're here reading reviews because everyone has told you about how amazing Game of Thrones is. So, let me tell you what the big deal is with this book.There's so much going on in the pages of the first book of this series, that it's difficult to know where the review should start.I won't spoil any of the story because part of this series' magic is Martin's astounding ability to surprise his readers on nearly every page, but allow me to give you a bit of a breakdown of the basic pre-plot. (I hear lots of people ask what GoT is about, only for a fanboy to give them a long-winded, spoiler-riddled answer that turns off the person asking)In Martin's world there are two major known continents, Westeros and Essos. Westeros is a continent that is ruled by the King on the Iron Throne. In the history of Westeros, there have been a great number of wars fought for The Iron Throne.A Game of Thrones begins with focus on the Starks of Winterfell. Ned Stark is the lord of Winterfell, and also an old friend of the king, Robert Baratheon. When Robert's Hand of the King (like an adviser who, more or less, does all the decision making for the king) dies, Robert visits Winterfell with his entire court to beseech Ned to become his new Hand of the King. This is a big deal for Ned, but when his wife Catelyn hears rumors that the previous Hand of the King was murdered by someone in Robert's court, The Starks begin to grow suspicious of the treachery hidden in the machinations of the Iron Throne and the Kingdom. When they begin to dig deeper, they open up an entire world of corruption, intrigue, betrayal, and double agents.What follows is an exploration of a fantastical fantasy world, plagued by the same very human folly that is destroying our own world.I don't want to say much more than that because (again) a lot of this book's charm is in its ability to surprise and shock the reader with great storytelling.Now, I understand. This book and series is certainly not for everyone. It's a long book with a plethora of complex and nuanced characters in a world of Fantasy. However, the storylines and themes are so all-encompassing and kaleidoscopic, that there is also something here for everyone. If you like murder mysteries, chivalric romance, magical happenings, political thrillers, high-octane action, brutally engaging war scenes, medieval fantasy, really ANYTHING, there's something here for you.In short, if you haven't read the book or seen the show, I can't recommend it highly enough. Before I checked it out, I was so sure that there was no way it could live up to everyone's hype. But once I saw it for myself, I was hooked by the first chapter. The hype is accurate, and I honestly believe this book and series may be one of the greatest things to happen to the human race.Check it out!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Finally, fantasy minus the DnD\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    In case it isn't obvious I read this on the Kindle. I don't remember any typos or mistakes in formatting as has been seen in some certain other Kindle editions. I will say the map may as well have not been included because it is simply impossible, at least on my particular model, to read anything on the map. I can bring it up on other devices in the Kindle reader (like a laptop) so I'm not really complaining.I'm not one of your avid readers who reads everything that comes out and finishes 1,000 page novels in a weekend. I have read a few fantasy books in the past couple years and they always seemed to be inspired by DnD on some level.I heard about this series and how adult and unpredictable it was. And the HBO adaption got me that much more excited about it.Well one thing that makes me want to give this a high rating is that it is decidedly NOT of the LotRs/DnD school of fantasy. It's much more of a political intrigue and situation manipulation sort of a thing. This isn't for your 7th - 12th grade audience in other words, it's more for college and older.Not everything is spelled out for you, some things are insinuated and you have to decide for yourself who is working towards what agenda.I won't try to summarize the plot but I will say I think I enjoy Jon Snow and Tyrion possibly the best. And indeed main characters do die, sometimes this is predictable sometimes not. I haven't really figured out why the story is told from the perspective of some characters and not from others.The only complaints I have about are the incredible number of different characters introduced. There's all these houses with different insignias who have married other houses and produced uncles and nephews and some relatives are more in line with that house than with this other one and...it's just hard to keep track of. Maybe that's more on me than the story to make sure all that stuff is tracked. In fact I may have to read this book a second time.The other complaint is the ending or perhaps the lack of an ending. None of the story lines really concludes, you just kind of finish a chapter and find yourself at the appendix.  I do want to read the next book though (I already bought it).As has been warned before this is not a book for the kids. There's blood, guts, sex, rape, decapitations...not a bed time story. And pregnant woman who may be emotional already may want to avoid it.I'm not sure there is really a \"good guy\" in this book. It's just kind of a set of families fighting with another set of families. Everyone is kind of a \"shade of grey\" in other words. No one's all the way in the right or all the way on the bad guy side.I did thoroughly enjoy the book and if you can past all the adult content mentioned above I highly recommend it.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Literary Evaluation\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones \"When you play the game of thrones, either you win or you die. There is no middle ground\" (Martin 448).  This quote from George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones captures the essence of the fantasy novel. Martin creates a medieval world that falls into turmoil after the death of King Robert Baratheon and features feuding families, fire-breathing dragons, and the mysterious \"white walkers\" who live beyond The Wall. Martin uses a complex setting, magical plot elements, and well-developed characters to bring the reader's into his world and creates an excellent fantasy novel in the process. Martin is able to create a setting so complex, it features an entirely fictional continent that the reader can't help but want to explore. He uses the experiences of the characters to introduce detailed locations. The audience journeys from The Wall cuts across the snowy North, to the lush, Mediterranean-like Riverlands of The South. Martin's descriptions can make you feel a shiver with Jon as \"the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens\" (115), or feel the rain as \"...it beat down on Ned's head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilt's\" (367).Martin is able to weave in fantastical elements that make sense to the story while thrilling his audience. As the novel opens, the reader travels with rangers of the Knight's Watch who are exploring the other side of The Wall, and encounter the Others, a supernatural race who are thought to be extinct. Martin leaves you on the edge of your seat as the rangers are killed and turned into zombie-like creatures. Martin leaves you breathless at the end of the novel as the beloved character Daenerys walks into a burning fire, only to emerge with three newly hatched dragons. Martin also creates well-developed characters that do not always fit into a typical `good vs. evil' paradigm. For example, the audience first identifies Lord Eddard Stark as a loving family man, but is confused when it is revealed that he had an affair and brings home the love child. Lord Stark is revealed to the audience as a brave leader, but later reveals that he has killed innocent people and burned cities to the ground. It is characters like these that make it hard for the audience to have just one opinion of Martin's characters; they are seen as complex people who are put in extraordinary circumstances, and allows the audience to engage in reflecting what makes a person `good' or `bad'. The world that George R. R. Martin creates in A Game of Thrones invites his readers in and challenges them to think beyond `good vs. evil'. Martin paints descriptive pictures and allows his audience to explore the terrain with his characters. He combines medieval courts with fantasy elements such as dragons and zombies. Martin creates characters that have human flaws that make them relatable even in such a fantastic setting. A Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy novel.Works CitedMartin, George R. R.

And it certainly requires a lot of talent and imagination to create an alternate world, people it with unforgettable characters and fill it up with challenges that would make the reader forget the reality. George R. R. Martin’s fantasy adventure saga is just that. (It was so addictive that I thanked God for giving me this book during the holidays.)Game of Thrones begins auspiciously enough with a mysterious death, when three of the night guards venture into the forest to investigate something strange. Attacked by a mysterious man with a blue sword, a knight dies while his companions flee.The author slowly introduces important characters, their relationships with each other, past history, present folly and future dreams. Told from points of view of different characters, the story progresses slowly, yet there is no lag anywhere, no urgency or urge to skip pages. Though each of these characters inhabit different locales, the author manages to keep the tempo just right.Lord Stark also known as Ned, learns that Jon Arran, his co-brother and ‘hand’ of the King is dead. The king who was also his friend, personally arrives to make Ned as the next ‘hand’ and proposes an alliance between the crown prince and Sansa, Ned’s daughter. Left with no choice, Ned agrees to leave his holding at Winterfell and move to King’s Landing, despite his son’s accidental fall.Far away in the free cities, two siblings Vicerys and Daenerys Targaryen, the rightful heirs to the Iron Throne are destitut,e trying their best to survive and conquer their rightful heritage. Vicerys literally sells his sister Dany to Khal Drogo, a powerful nomad chief, hoping that he would provide him with an army to conquer his land.In the meanwhile, Ned finds himself surrounded by intrigues, plots and betrayal in the King’s Landing. King Robert, drunk and absent is surrounded by enemies and a hostile queen. Trying to unravel the mystery of Jon Arran’s death, Ned becomes the target of the queen, who wants get rid of him.The racy pace of the story, will keep you on the edge of the seat, making the book unputdownable. I read somewhere that the plot lines of these series, were based on the war of roses, a tumultuous period of hundred year war in English history. The author does a very commendable job of tracing the history of each family, their heirs, their marriages, alliances and their fates intertwined with that of the iron throne.The books opens a virtual box of pandora and leaves the readers with many questions that would get hopefully answered in the subsequent books.Plus Points: Great plot, perfect language, good prose and descriptionsMinus Points: Too much of blood and gore. And the bad news is that it is going to get worse as the story progresses. A word of caution, don’t get attached to any character. The author might bump him off.Verdict: Addictive, engrossing and gripping. A must-read!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Captivating .... get ready when you listen to these stories\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George R.R. Martin's \"Story of Ice and Fire\" books are becoming legend among fantasy fiction lovers.  This book one \"A Game of Thrones\" ... introduces you to a truly ingeneous fictional feudal world of Lord's and Ladies as they really probably were (NASTY people)... of their \"blooded\" children and [...] children ... set in a world where summmers and winters last for a lifetime for many if not most.  This story is set in a time when summer is fading to winter.  The eternal struggle for the Lords is the control of the Iron Throne ... where the King of Kings resides.  The Lords are heads of \"Families\" who have been at war with one another throughout their known history. The holder of the Iron Throne rules all of the \"Families\", by majority rule, essentially. Ofcourse, if the King is murdered, entranced by a sorcerer, or co-opted by a rival family marrying their son to one of the Kings supporter's daughter ... thus stealing the King's support ... perhaps enough to challenge the King for the Throne.  Or, maybe the plot is to simply kill the King and all of his family at one fell swoop and sieze the Throne.  Can it be held against the revenge of King's supporters?  All of this and much more exist in this world, told from the viewpoints of many different Lords and \"Family\" members ... each chapter is headed by the name of the main character for the chapter... and the individual lives progress through the book in different chapters at different times in the story ... but beginning where the last chapter left off with that character ... WOW... I had to keep going back to remember where this particular character was going .... YOU CAN'T READ/LISTEN TO THESE STORIES WITHOUT BEING DRAWN IN ... SLOWLY AT FIRST ... WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE.  I'm now listening to the second story ... \"The Clash of Kings\"... better because I already knew I was hooked on the stories...The hardest part of getting started in this book is trying to keep all of the family characters straight ... so you can understand the motivation behind their plots and schemes (plots within plots within plots... Incestious royal children acknowledged by the King as his children (wow) ... similar to understanding the early history of the Roman Empire actually ... as Machiavelli saw it in The Prince.  The ends justify the means.  If you enjoy the intregue of real history in a fantasy setting you'll love these stories.As for Roy Dotrice, the reader of the book I listened to, he grows on you as you progress.  Being a little snobish about my favorite readers, when I first began listening I wasn't drawn into the intricacy of the story because I wasn't drawn in by the reader.  When I finally started paying more attention to the story itself (because if you don't you will soon be lost) I found Dotrice's reading very well done, he has fairly good character recognition skills ... perhaps not the range of say Jim Dale or Simon Jones ... but well above average none the less...

Especially when compared to something like Harry Potter in which everything up to, and including, the crapper is magical. Here is a list of just about everything magical I could find:1. Ancient tree spirits2. Ancient undead . . . things3. Extra long seasons. A typical round of seasons might look like this: summer lasts 7 years, fall last 3 years, winter last 5 years, spring last 4 years, summer last 4 years, fall last 6 years, etc.4. Children grow up faster. From the way the story is written (he never explicitly says one way or another) we can conclude that children reach maturity much sooner than \"real\" people do. So, a 15 year old boy is equal to a 18 or 19 year old \"real\" boy. Likewise a 13 year old girl is equal to a 16 or 17 year old \"real\" girl. It is a little odd but you get use to it.*****Characters*****Many of the characters are either stock, evil or borrowed from some other pieces of fiction. There are several who are \"good\", many who are \"bad\" and a handful whom are \"indifferent\". Yet, in spite of all of that it is easy believe that they are real. Martin does a good job of making them seem lifelife. So, even if you think you have seen them before they are still crafted nicely here. There aren't that many truly unique characters though and no one exists as \"The Hero\".*****Action*****Very limited action considering the amount of story telling that goes on. There is a tournament, a war, lots of brawling and the occasional fist fight. If you need lots of adventure go buy a comic book because this isn't for you.*****Plot*****This is a very plot driven story. The plot is interesting, don't get me wrong, but it can get a little tiring at points. Most of the time you will try and unravel the many mysterys laid before you and thus won't notice (too much) that the book is really long. Now, I am not against long books, provided there is a point to all that length. Writing just to fill space annoys me though. And while Martin is interesting, and descriptive, there are times when I think an editor should have gone though this thing a little harder than he originally did.So, overall, do I recomend this book? Sort of. If you can get past the lack of action and magic then this isn't too bad of a book. Here is an interesting note, though. If Martin had taken out the 4 somewhat magical elements of this book, changed the setting to medieval Europe and modified a few names, then this could easily sit on the \"Fictional History\" shelf.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It took nearly 6 years, but I finally finished it!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Game of Thrones centers on the power pulpit of the Iron Throne and the households/kingdoms that King Robert Baratheon and his wife, Queen Cersei Lannister command. Things are well and good between the various households, but it doesn't stay that way for long. In a land where summers last decades and winters last lifetimes, trouble is brewing and the Stark family is right in the middle of it. In addition to treachery, deceit, and bloodshed between warring households, there is another element to worry very deeply about - what lies beyond The Wall protecting the Northern and Southern lands. As winter returns so do the things that go bump in the night and supernatural/dark forces that were only a part of scary children's stories, begin to become all too real to the inhabitants of the Northern and Southern households. Dark times are coming for everyone and the reader is sucked in by just who will be left when it's all said and done?Several years ago, I gave up on two books (Dune and Game of Thrones) and missed out on great series due to thinking they were just too complex and wordy. Now after reading this book (in addition to re-reading and completing Dune), I can say that I definitely appreciate it that much more a 2nd time around. While reading a Game of Thrones, the biggest thing is to not get frustrated/bogged down with all the characters, descriptions and side-stories. You do need to know who's who and where palces are, but don't let that ruin the enjoyment of the book for you. What helped me out a lot was finally watching the immensely popular HBO series with the same name and then I started to pick the book back up and was amazed how much the TV series helped my imagination/understanding out. It might not work for everyone. At the end of the day, you might still decide Game of Thrones just isn't your cup of tea... but at least give the TV series a shot and then go back and tackle this book! Just some advice from one formerly confused reader to another! :)Overall Martin does a really good job developing characters you either love or hate as well as developing the overall plot and plots within plots element of Game of Thrones. ***very small spoiler***Perhaps the most interesting bit of all is that this was really the first book that isn't shy about killing off it's main characters. I guess I've been sheltered throughout my reading career in that the author has never had the guts to do such a thing consistently, but Martin does it in abundance and pulls no punches in this book. At first it was shocking, but then I realized it really made the book that much better.  Admittedly,  Game of Thrones is a little wordy at times and probably 300 or so pages bigger than your average novel in a series, but it's well-worth the read if you have patience and get through the 1st book. The ending is well-done in that it's not quite a cliffhanger, but it makes you think \"wow, I really want to know how all these ends are going to tie together in the next book!\"\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"5"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Better than the TV series\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was not expecting much when I downloaded the book, but I was really surprised how exceptional the book is written.

I recently revisited a bunch of Robert Heinlein books I had not read in years, I’m currently on a Game of Thrones kick and this leads to somewhat erratic posting. So I thought I would just start reviewing whatever it is that I read and readers can decide whether they want to view it or not. Anyway, on with the book.I did a marathon of the HBO series before starting on the books. I was not a follower from the beginning, but during a particularly long and cold week this winter I watched the whole series up to where the current season would start. I really enjoyed the TV series, but was curious what tidbits might have been left out from the written version. There are always differences between a TV series and the books, nuances that you miss, foreshadowing and outright changes to the story though I do have to say that the first season of the series was pretty much right to the book.I’m enjoying reading the books though sometimes the descriptions drag on a bit long for me. Of course, I’m inpatient by nature so that may not be a problem for others. The story as a whole is complex and well done. I immediately became a fan of the Stark clan and their direwolves and I’ve enjoyed every moment of the time I have spent in this fantasy realm. I suspect that I will read all of the books since I’m finishing the second one and have the third one waiting for me on my desk. The first book introduces all the characters, sets the scene for the story to come and is long enough to give you time to really get familiar with the characters and start to love or hate them as they deserve.Martin did an excellent job with this book.  The characters have obvious depth and the world building was done well enough to suck me in at once. I read a lot of science fiction, but I enjoy a well crafted fantasy from time to time. There are more hints at the usual fantasy elements of magic and dark things in the first book than actual experiences for the characters with such things, more ancient tales that people wonder if they are true. I’m going to leave it there for anyone who hasn’t read the books or watched the series and would like to. Nevertheless, I’m enjoying my adventures with the characters on both sides of the Narrow Sea and hope my fascination with this world continues as I’ve had such a good time up until now.This review was originally posted on my blog [...] and is worded as such.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    FOR NEW READERS - Good book, but warning about series!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I finally got fed up with fan boys claiming this is the best series to ever grace the earth EVEN AFTER the last installment(s), and wanted to make a note for new readers to the Song of Fire & Ice saga.  This book get's a solid 4 1/2 stars.  The series as a whole after five installments, 2 stars.Basically, be prepared to enjoy the first half (Books 1-3), and wear a straight jacket for the remainder (Books 4-5).This 1st installment is a great book and definitely leaves you wanting more.  While certainly not Tolkien quality as some have claimed (admitting they are different writers with different approaches), GRRM continually brings a wonderful new angle into this genre.  No reason to repeat all of the positive reviews on this site (regarding any of the F&I books) since anyone looking through can get a feel for the positives... and (in the end) ultimate negatives regarding this series.  And here is where new readers need to research, what is being said about books 4 & 5 BEFORE they start diving in!To the point: Books 4 & 5... rubbish.  Waste of time.  It was extremely painful getting through four, but I kept promising the fifth (and initially / supposedly planned as the LAST) of the series would make it all worth while as well as reach a climatic conclusion.  Nope.  Five was worse.  Goes NO where, ties ZERO loose ends, kills any mental stimulation regarding all of the previously enjoyed characters, etc etc etc meh.  And now we must wait for installment six... SEVEN as rumors now claim?  I kept wondering if George Lucas had somehow gotten involved and starting adding his input on how to draw out BS sequences and potentially kill a series.  Can anyone say Robert Jordan?Now, as time continues to pass, there are worries that GRRM may never even finish this series due to his making readers wait nearly 8 years for the latest installment of nothingness (and over TEN years for certain favorite characters to even have a mention).  And if he were to \"rush\" the next book due to his new TV endeavor, many fear it would understandably fall short.  And rush he may have to... because where the heck is the TV series going to go once they reach the fourth installment?  Nobody would continue watching.  And applause to GRRM for getting the TV series in motion, nothing wrong with notoriety and building upon one's passion... however fears of where it can possibly go does remain.My advice if you are looking to read this epic... WAIT until (or if) this series of novels concludes and decide what people have to say about it then. If people rave about the conclusion, GREAT!  I will explain exactly as I have here.  Starts fantastic.  Dies, burns, & infuriates in the middle.  Concludes with ...well, we will see.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    **** ½ - A Pinnacle of Fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have read plenty of average fantasy in my life, so I wasn't looking forward to diving into any more eight hundred page novels that might be of a similar caliber. Strike two is that I don't generally love much of anything that's set in a medieval time period... so my expectations were low until I started reading reviews everywhere. Still hesitant at that point, I purchased this novel and was blown away.Martin is unbelievable in  that he is willing to do so many things with his characters that you wouldn't expect (or want him to do), but in the long run, making big moves like these are what really create the epic moments that you won't forget anytime soon.The other major plus is that he the best in the genre at creating so many moments of tension. You just can't wait to find out where this next plot twist is going to take you... and then he moves you on to another protagonist's/antagonist's point of view. Once this story gets moving, I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind! It's nearly impossible not to skip ahead in the book to the next portion of that character's story.Overall, Martin has created a remarkably engrossing  storyline with a  broad cast of well-developed characters that would rival almost any work of fiction that I've read.  He does pretty much everything right in this novel, however, the only reasons I don't give it a five star rating are:1. My lack of enthusiasm of this time period in general; he does it very well, but it's still not my favorite thus bringing my enjoyment level down a notch or two2. I didn't really learn anything from the novel. It's very fun to read, but one of the things about reading fiction, nonfiction, etc is that I love to learn from the writer. Many of my favorite authors of fiction know how to weave lots of incredible depth and emotional development into their characters that we can apply to our situations (or to other people that we've interacted with).Don't get me wrong, this is incredible writing, and I am highly recommending it to anyone that loves to read.... and if you've never read fantasy before, focus your energy here.*****___(Perfection)  The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading****½___(Excellent)  Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of \"subjective\" categories****____(Influential)  A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre***½____(Good)  Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended***_____(Average)  Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer**______(Poor)  Constantly asking myself, \"How much worse can this get?\" every few minutes*_______(Terrible)  Belongs in the dumpster...

This is an all encompassing, fantastic novel, in which Martin creates a vividly detailed alternate world. In this world, there are 3 main groups: the Others who live in the frigid snowlands, the Dothraki who resemble American Plains Indians, and  the Kingdoms of Westeros who resemble Medieval Europe.  The author gives great detail to the traditions and culture of the Dothraki and Westeros, giving them the feeling being real people and real places. Not much detail is given about the mysterious Others in this novel, although they are featured in a few of the side stories. Adding to the real-worldness of this novel, are the many different characters that are developed, and the different story lines happening through out the book. An overarching theme of the book is political intrigue, as we learn that the current King Robert took the throne by force, that brother Viserys and his sister Daenerys are the only 2 survivors of the previous king's lineage and of their plot to retake the throne,  the Dothraki enlisted to help them who are afraid of the sea and have no desire to enter Westeros, the Night Watch who dedicate their lives to protecting Westeros from the Others and mythical creatures which many people believe no longer exist.  The characters in this book are many and varied. The book takes the format of each chapter being from the view of a different character, which helps organize the different plot lines. The characters are diverse and well-developed, and we see their flaws, as well as their abilities.  I did really like the unique names and common names with unique spelling, that Martin gave the characters. One minor flaw, the author throws in many made-up words, and while this adds to the flavor of the alternate world, it can make it difficult to discern what is being said in some places. One caution for younger or more sensitive readers, this book does contain a lot of graphic violence (including against children), a scene describing a dark magic ritual, incest and rape (including a scene that alludes to a pre-pubescent girl being sent to a house of prostitution.)  Given all that, this book is definitely not for everyone, but for people who enjoy lengthy novels they can fully delve into, this book is one of the best.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Wrong address\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The books were in excellent condition but wrong house.

R. R. Martin's Ice and Fire series, so I was predisposed to be impressed. I had held off reading it because a) it isn't finished - there are at least two more books yet to be written, and b) with five books already in the series, averaging 800 pages, I wanted to be sure I was ready for the commitment. After watching the first two seasons on HBO I couldn't hold out any longer - and I'm glad I didn't.The story is richly imagined and meticulously detailed, feeling more like a forgotten history than a fantasy novel. The characters, both good and bad (lots of these) are fully drawn, at least the significant ones (LOTS of these). Whether you like someone or hate them, you'll be very clear about why.The scope of this book is huge; there are Seven Kingdoms just on the first continent you encounter, and there will be at least one more. Conditions are deteriorating quickly for the residents of these lands, with war breaking out all over. Folks get taken hostage, injured, enslaved...there isn't a lot of happiness here.One thing that might be a problem for some is that each chapter is about a different character, all told in the third person. This can be a bit disorienting until you start getting the people straight (watching the TV show was a BIG help here - I already had visuals of the people). There are a LOT of characters; I suggest writing them down with a little bio. There are lists available online, but I found that seeing ALL of them at once was more overwhelming than helpful. If you write down the name, the House to which they belong, and their place of origin, it should be enough to keep you from getting too confused.Some other things that may not be to everyone's taste: the violence, the sex, and the language. Some of the things described here make \"Braveheart\" seem light and happy, the sex is plentiful, graphic, and taboo-breaking, and there are words here that, in general, I try not to even think, yet alone use. But the thing is...it works. It's awful, but in context. If these sorts of things don't generally bother you, you'll be fine. Even if they do, the strength of the writing most likely will carry you along, drawn by the need to know what becomes of Daenarys, or Arya, or Bran, or...well, you get the idea.This is a fantasy novel for those who don't generally read them - which includes me. I started (and pretty much ended) my interest in this genre with \"The Lord of the Rings\". After you've read the best, why read the rest? Well, now I know why; because there are whole new worlds out there, and they're worth exploring.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Five stars for what is and what could have been...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is the most impressive fantasy book I've read in decades, one of the few that captured my imagination long after the book was done.  People liken Mr. Martin to Tolkien, but his greatness lies in *not* being like Tolkien: not once during the book did I think of LOTR.  The latter had the flavor of Arthurian legend and the old sagas; this has the much grittier feel of the Middle Ages, with real people and real politics.Pros: where to begin?  The world he created is unique and wide-ranging, spanning continents and cultures.  His characterizations are superb: he has a cast of hundreds, but every one stands out.  His division of chapters according to viewpoint gives each character the chance to show their own personality and motivations.  Interactions between characters were realistic, dialogue was natural, and people acted consistently with who they were and what they wanted.  He was able to spin out 800+ pages without the plot ever dragging, and the thing kept me up late 3 nights in a row until I finished it.  That was a week ago, and it's still on my mind.Cons: the first is picayune - I'm a little uncomfortable with sex scenes involving 13 year olds.  Yes, child brides were/are the norm for certain cultures, but I'm still not easy with it.  The notion of a 15yo boy leading men to war is even more incongruous.  I just don't see a 15yo, no matter how well trained, as having the experience and judgement required to mount a large scale campaign.  But these are trifles.The real problem with the book is its ending - it doesn't really have one.  The whole thing is basically setup for the next book, with nothing resolved and everything left hanging.  And it gives the distinct impression that the next book would do the same, and the next, and the next...  It was like spending days climbing an enormous mountain, only to get to the top and see an endless vista of more mountains to climb.I was concerned enough to look at the reviews for the rest of the books in the series.  Sure enough, they were of a pattern: nothing resolved, everything left hanging.  Further, the author seems to have developed a sadistic streak.  Killing off my favorite character was emotional punishment enough, but killing off all of them?  I think he's stymied with the next book b/c he's murdered, maimed, or tortured everybody of interest, and has nobody left now to care about.So this book stands as an unfinished symphony: magnificent of itself, yet a poignant reminder of what might have been.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Simply Captivating...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It is difficult to offer this book praise that hasn't already been offered, but I would feel remiss not to chime in as this is without question one book among the best I've ever read.  The book is structured so that within the main story, there are a large number of other stories, each reliant upon a specific character.  What the book amounts to is a collection of stories about a large cast of specific and very deeply developed characters that, when taken as a whole, begin to paint a picture of the larger \"story-behind-the-story.\"  Each individual chapter of the book rises into climax and resolution, giving it the feel of constant action and tension, while continuously setting up future conflicts.  The main story doesn't resolve, and in fact deepens just as the book concludes, paving the way for what promises to be an explosive second volume.  I'll wrap up with a few comments to respond to some of the reviews I read before starting this book:1. There is a good bit of sex, and some profanity, but only as seems necessary to establish traits and personalities of the main characters.  Although at times graphic, these parts are not drawn out or dwelt upon and are not typically made to be focal points of the story.  They are accessories for the sake of characterization, doing their job well, driving the reader to deeper love/hate of the character involved.2.  Anyone who says that the plots don't resolve doesn't understand the structure of the book.  This isn't one story.  It is many that are interwoven.3. There are indeed ALOT of major characters, and at first it seems daunting to try to get to know them all and keep track of who is doing what.  Trust me when I say this resolves very quickly as you get to know the characters and their houses and involve yourself with their lives.  This is what makes this book rich.  It is a depth I've not seen in any other novel I've read.4. The book leaves much to interpretation.  Being character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some.  The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you.  There is no real \"good guy/bad guy\" here.  I find that within the same houses there are family members that I truly love, and those that so anger me I can almost experience them tangibly.I can't say enough about this book.  It is the most deeply developed, emotionally moving, heart stirring, adrenalin pumping, vastly entertaining, beautifully and classicly written piece of modern literate art I have read in a very, very long time.  Just wow.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Swords, Kings and Dragons\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    After seeing the previews for Game of Thrones on HBO in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was somewhat disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR and I'm glad that I did. Game of Thrones was one of the best things on TV in 2011. It was so good that I purchased the book to get the source's perspective, and after finishing the book I'd say that the HBO adaptation of Game of Thrones kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties.It was great to read the book after seeing the show to be able to put faces with all of the names. The standout descrepany from book to screen is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in a book it's okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly HBO thought a lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct.Game of Thrones is a very long read with a ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequrent books it's a common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this first in the series and I'm a few chapters into the second in the series called A Clash of Kings.Game of Thones sets the stage for the rest of the epic series and introduces what I'm guessing will be the key players. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you'd have thought would \"never die\" by the end of Game of Thrones. What's clear is that war lies in the future and the book details the violent struggles among the land's controlling families and kingdoms. And as there will evidently be more than just human encounters to deal with in the struggles for power as A Clash of Kings and the rest of the story unfolds.I'm hooked on A Song of Ice and Fire, and I'll be done with Clash of Kings prior to the second HBO season which is a nice reversal of order. Don't miss this series if you're into the action/fantasy genre.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I'd like to mention that though this is for the ebook ...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book was lying on my TBR for so long, and I finally got around to reading it. Before I start with the review, I'd like to mention that though this is for the ebook version, I mostly read this via audiobook (Whispersync rocks!) and that made the whole journey a bit easier. If you find yourself intimidated by the length of this mammoth, ignore the hour count on the audiobook and get started, because Roy Doytrice is a wonderful narrator. He does some spectacular work in bringing these voices alive, though at times his bass makes it difficult to judge the age of the character. Nevertheless, with the amount of characters in the book and the range of characters he has to portray, he does a commendable job in it.As for the main story, as this is an epic novel I thought it would be slow-paced. But imagine my surprise when the author pulls you right in this world of dragons and wight walkers, and medieval politics, and a complex religious system. However, even with all the world-building, nowhere did I feel there was a info dump going on, because the world of A Song of Ice and Fire is constructed slowly, character by character, backstory by backstory and myth by myth. It can feel drawn out at times, but since I had the knowledge of the plot from the show, I knew almost every plot arc was leading up to something. It makes for a very involved and complex plotline, one that involves many regions, languages, and belief systems.A slight problem I had with the book was the overabundance of characters. Especially the endless parade of knights and houses and lords being mentioned, when I had no idea who would be significant. And considering how much plot happens, even if a character is called back later on in a subsequent book, I wouldn't even realize. Another is the misogyny, and subtle racism in the book - for this book only, the lone explicitly POC race (the Dothraki) is depicted as barbaric and monstrous. And no, even if Dany loved Khal Drogo, I cannot condone a character who proudly vows to rape the women of his enemies (amongst all the killing and plundering) in his conquest of the Seven Kingdoms. Granted it is made to be realistically fantasy, it still irks me how sexual violence is often a plot device in books.Content warning for sexual abuse, violence, coarse language, incest (gods, this is a long list).\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"6"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \"Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice.\"\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Most people nowadays are quite familiar with the TV series \"Game of Thrones,\" but how do the books differ from the adaptation?I think it's important to know that one of the major factors that drove George R. R. Martin to write his \"A Song of Ice & Fire\" series was his frustration as a television screenwriter with producers telling him that his ideas had to be pared down due filming logistics and budget. With this series, he set out to tell the grandest, most ambitious story that he could conjure: pure imagination unfettered by deadlines and production costs.The series was always intended to start with a narrow focus, then expand to a much grander scale, then close back in for the dramatic conclusion. So, pretty much any adaptation of this ever-growing mega-story is going to have to make some drastic chops and changes.Because Book One here finds the story at its smallest and tightest, though, the TV adaptation is fairly close to the source material in its first season. That said, there are some major adaptational decisions that set the show apart from the books right from the get-go. With very few exceptions, the show runners decided not to rely on flashbacks, dreams, prophecies, or any internal monologue. This is in stark contrast to the book material, which revels in the world of the internal. The show also eschews the books' strict adherence to limited third person points of view for a more omniscient telling of the events. While the adaptation is most concerned with spectacular events concerning the world's most powerful figures, \"A Game of Thrones\" tends to focus on how the actions and policies of powerful figures affect those without much power. In other words, it's about consequences and blow back rather than about the spectacle itself. The limited points of view also make for great repeat reads, as the narrators are all unreliable in some way or another. Martin is not a cynic as some like to think, but he certainly makes the point that heroism is often thankless, progress is stilted and compromised, conflict is hard to resist, and peace is a very fragile thing. Overall, there's a haunting quality to a lot of the story, and a gnawing sense of horror, rather than the saucy intrigue of the show.While it's excellent reading even upon multiple re-reads, \"A Game of Thrones\" is probably my least favorite of the series so far, as it occasionally features some awkward ideas or stiff prose. Thankfully these problems vanish in Book Two, and the beauty of Martin's writing grows with every work he releases.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Those willing to tolerate an certain level of: vulgarity, domestic violence, rape, sexual exploitation of children, incest...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    and murder will likely find this to be a pretty good read.I purchased Game of Thrones because of its popularity with Amazon.com readers, thinking that my 12-year-old bookworm son, a fan of fantasy, might like it. Fortunately, I decided to preview it before handing it off to him, during which I quickly realized that I was wrong. The book's mature themes and graphic descriptions of violence place it squarely in a category best left for adults. Although fantasy is not a genre I generally seek out, I found Mr. Martin's storytelling utterly entertaining, in spite of its above average level of brutality, the descriptions of which left me feeling nearly queasy. The author develops his cast of over 200 characters well and is somehow able to flawlessly keep track of the extreme number of interrelationships required to put together a compelling story about, as the title says, the \"game of thrones,\" a phrase characters use throughout the book. Thankfully for readers, the author includes an appendix cataloguing the seven different families, their relative relationships, and other relevant information, which should not be referred to unless absolutely necessary as it includes some spoilers. The book's hook, provided in the prologue is intriguing; members of the Night's Watch have a run-in with some otherworldly characters. Its first chapter is told from the perspective of Brandon \"Bran\" Stark, the seven-year-old son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, in which he sees his first execution. In the second, Eddard's wife, Lady Catelyn learns that her sister's husband, Jon Arryn has died under suspicious circumstances. Eddard Stark suspects the king, a longtime friend, will ask that he accept the responsibility of becoming the King's Hand. The author spends the rest of the 600 plus pages spinning an intricately plotted tale, alternately told from the perspectives of these former three, plus two of Bran's sisters, his half brother, a spunky little person named Tyrion Lannister, and a brave, proud 13-year-old named Princess Daenerys. The \"game\" involves such things as: honor, violence, betrayal, revenge, the consumption of an entire uncooked horse's heart (as well as fermented mare's milk \"thick with clots\"), and to top it off...sex between siblings. In summary, readers who enjoy fantasy and can tolerate the bad behavior that tends to go along with warring royalty, will likely find Game of Thrones to be a thoroughly entertaining story. Also good: Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The best fantasy novel I've read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am not a huge fan of fantasy novels, but I've read several in the past and had heard great things about the \"Song of Fire and Ice\" series. After a very disappointing attempt to get through the first \"Wheel of Time\" novels by Robert Jordan, I decided to give the genre one last try. Thankfully, \"A Game of Thrones\" was the book that redeemed it. Unlike many fantasy novels, \"A Game of Thrones\" is not overloaded with fantastical elements such as wizardry, elves, and mythical monsters such as chimeras and griffons running around. It does touch on these and makes evident that dragons and magic has existed, but the story takes place in an age where much of this has passed, so it does not interfere with the story. Some readers might be concerned by this, afraid that the lack of such elements would make for a boring story, but it is just the opposite. By putting these things in the background, it allows Martin to focus on what I think he does best, character development.There is good reason that each chapter in \"A Game of Thrones\" is named after a character. This book has some of the best character development I've ever read in a fictional novel. There are many characters, but Martin does an exceptional job at avoiding the trap of confusing the reader with so many names. He can keep adding new characters with ease, as they are developed so well and so memorable, that it is not likely the reader will get them mixed up or forget them anytime soon. I feel like I know each of the protagonists intimately, and there is an emotional connection whenever something significant happens to them. And that occurs quite a bit.The second great thing about this book, is that Martin is not afraid to take risks. I was completely caught by surprise many times throughout the story. This is a gritty tale, and nothing is held back. People die, and many times it is a grisly death. Do not get too attached to any main character because as you will find out, any one of them can be killed off, no matter how important they may seem. I could not believe some of the events that took place, and kept expecting to find out they were dream sequences in later chapters, only to come to the realization that this is Martin's style, and it works beautifully. If you are looking for a fantasy novel that focuses on people and realism, that is loaded with action & deceit, and is filled with twists at every chapter, \"A Game of Thrones\" is where you should go.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    An Apple A Day Will Keep A Good Book Away\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I read the review below by 'Apple' and felt the need to respond. Female characters in these novels are anything but whores, burly inn-maids and manly women. They are fierce, passionate and devoted characters with a drive and determination that often eclipses that of men. Examples follow:Catelyn Stark: A proud and honorable woman who has a commanding presence and a passionate heart. Even with her admirable traits, which are countless, you can't completely love her, for she holds a deep seeded hatred for her bastard step-child, Jon Snow, who is very undeserving of this.Queen Cersei: A cruel villian plotting to have her son on the throne, her manipulations are intelligent and evil, far beyond anything that a common bar whore could come up with.Sansa Stark: A prude at first who blossoms into the image of her mother and as of book four has yet to be deflowered, thus making her not a whore.Ayra Stark: A tomboy who looks like her father and later joins a mysterious guild. She holds a terrible grudge against so many people, reciting all of their names to inspire her every day. Also, not a whore.Lysa Arryn: Sister to Catelyn and slightly crazed, who sees the plot of the Lannisters, but isolates herself in her mountain home and coddles her sickly and bizarre son. Oh, and not a whore.Daenerys: A princess to a lost line of kings, who is regularly beaten into submission by her power hungry and insane brother and marries to bring him the crown (the result of which needs to be read, for her brother does get a crown, but not the one he hoped). She is perhaps one of the most powerful and enduring female charchters of all time. Also, not a whore, she is a Queen.All of these women are strong, intelligent and beautifully crafted characters who add nothing but depth to a wonderfully told story. This series takes a while because it's good. Other worlds release two books a year and those books are childish, good vs. evil cliches that never stick with you. These books have meat, and they are a joy to read. With HBO optioning to make a series of the novels and GRRM eagerly anticipating them, I don't see this series going unfinished. It will take time, but it will be finished. Do not rob yourself of the experience. He is a self made author, and I'd promote myself as much as possible if I could as well. He has done nothing more than show a love for his world and share it with his readers. I think 'Apple' is sadly unable to enjoy the quality before her.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    More meat less fat please\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    My over all impression of this book was that it was a good story with gripping characters, and a whole lotta fat!This story has an army of characters good, evil, indifferent, but all interesting enough. There have already been plenty of reviews that tell the basics plot and subplots so I will not get into that. I will say that while cumbersome, Martins does spin a very interesting tale with the right mix of drama, intrigue, humor, and romance. From an author's stand point, there probably were a lot of characters that the story did not need but for this story, adding a lot of characters for the sake of \"expanding the empire\" seemed appropriate.Here's my main problem with the book: It was far longer that it needed it to be. This book was almost 700 pages with the same length and width of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hard cover. The print was maybe 8pt. Why was this story so long? It was not because that much happened in the book, it was because Martin over describes everything. My best example of this how he takes two and a half pages to describe an Inn that the characters are in for a few hours. Yes, a very pivotal moment happens there that may actually effect the series as a whole, but at the end of the day it is still just an Inn. My over all impression of this in was that one of the main characters spent much of her childhood there, but now it is nothing like it was. I don't remember the rest of the description, but I know what an Inn looks like in these stories. You have to realize the human mind can only retain so much at a time. Very often I found myself skipping ahead to get past information I didn't need.The one character I do want to talk about is Daenerys. I enjoyed her subplot very much. The thing is her story is one that in my opinion should have been its own story. I know there is a tie in but in my opinion it is very week. If anything her story is how she breaks away from the story going on in the seven kingdoms. I know this is a series and her story will probably tie in better as the series progresses.I would recommend this book for people who love as much detail as possible and are impressed buy how many words an author can squeeze into a chapter. For the rest of us, I am looking forward to watching the series on blue ray.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    What a book!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am typically a Mystery/Suspense novel snob. Rarely have I varied my path from those books, but more and more recently I have been making the switch. At a time when mystery novels have nearly ceased to excite me, I have needed to look elsewhere. I would have never expected to find comfort in the arms of Sci-fi/Fantasy, yet here I am before you.I have read The Lord of the Rings, but my experience beyond has been disappointing. A few years ago, at the urging of a friend I picked up a copy of The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, Book 1 of the Wheel of Time series. My first non-Tolkien Sci-fi/Fantasy experience was a bust. It probably took me a week if not more to read the first 13 pages. Try though I might, I could not find myself lost in Jordan's world. At 832 pages, it was not a book I wanted to take my time and give a truly fair chance.Needless to say that I was hesitant when the recommendation came to try the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. Same friend as before to make the recommendation, but this time he let the book speak for itself. A Game of Thrones spoke loudly to me. I actually read the first however many pages right from Amazon.com and before I knew it I had bought a copy.Martin's writing style, in respect to different chapters, was very interesting. He titled a chapter as the name of a key character and then the subsequent pages would be some unfolding of the story from that character's perspective. This kept the story fresh at all times; ever-changing.I will warn you that if you are a reader who likes to see each character to whom you become attached remain unharmed, this may not be the series for you. Martin dares to allow the big name(s) to die. Not all authors will take this step, I like it. It makes you realize that at any time, any one of the characters in the story could be killed. Not that this book needed help creating excitement, but this element certainly added to it.In true Sci-fi/Fantasy style, A Game of Thrones was a long book (Book 2, A Clash of Kings is even longer). When I would normally expect relief at the end of such a long book (807 pages), here I found actual goosebumps and the burning desire to continue the series.I applaud the author for his writing; his mix of sci-fi/fantasy with mystery and romance and everything in between, I thank Thomas for his recommendation which I pass on to you, and I order my copy of Book 2.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    nothing to add but...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    well, first of all i am not a fantasy buff; i have read a few works but I was introduced to this by an off-hand remark in a financial newsletter, believe it or not.  I read 2-3 books at a time, and was looking for some new engrossing fiction, so I bought Game of Thrones.I'd just come off listening to a 3 volume audio CD work from the Teaching Company on the Middle Ages by a William and Mary prof named Daileader, and it was remarkable.  There wasn't a second in the series where I wasn't attentive.  So it was ironic that I stumbled onto this, which essentially puts clothes on the historical framework of that era.  Face it, even if we are a historian, we never get more than a few points of view of events or time.  What GRRM has done is fictionalize this history, and he is remarkably accomplished at it. The book is gripping, and is beyond criticism, frankly.  Those who criticize it need to move on.  Either you like it or you don't.  You may not enjoy the style, the frankness, the intrigue, the gore and that is fine.  BUt it is your issue, not the quality of the book.  Just buy it yourself and decide for yourself.Next, there's no need to compare this.  It is a monumental work, but comparing it to LOTR is vacuous.  LOTR set the standard and in a sense is a whole different type of work.  It is slightly derivative of LOTR although not just a plagiarized re working of LOTR like Harry Potter (which I also enjoyed).  Tolkien created an entire world, language, culture, bestiary.  GRRM rather puts the type of human events that we all know - greed, fear, cunning, betrayal, love, lust, hatred, revenge, famine - into the skeletal framework of history.  ANd it is no mean feat, believe me. The scope of what he does is almost superhuman.  How he creates personalities, names, events, and keeps them straight is a remarkable accomplishment.  Yes, as some have said if you are sensitive you may not want to read this; the rape scenes, the death scenes, torture scenes - are graphic (how the hell did he figure out so many different ways to kill people?). So avoid the temptation to nickname yourself after a character but for sheer amazement and enjoyment pick up this series and decide for yourself.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Best book I ever read.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I originally read this many years ago and recently decided to do a reread and it's as awesome as I remember. I've never read a book that the author has invested so much time and thought into the back story.  The world comes to life so vividlyvwhen I read this book and it's not because there is a TV show that I can base it on.  It's from his rich and descriptive writing.I never read a book or a series like this before.  I like fantasy but I go more towards the urban fantasy side of things.  I do like to read about past monarchs and so that's what had originally drew me to this book.  I had heard it was going to be a show on HBO and people were excited so I bought the book to try it out.  My first read through I read it in two days.  Stayed up all night reading.  Needless to say I missed some things so that's why while I'm waiting the neverending wait til book 6 comes out all the while avoiding spoilers from the TV show, I devided to reread and see if it was as good as I believed.  It's better!There are so many fawning reviews that I'm sure my review will be lost in the middle but if someone does ever read this wondering is it worth it.  It is.  It truly is.  This first book especially is awesome.  It's seems overwhelming with its cast of characters but it's not.This book sets the tone and introduces you to the main characters of the book or are they?  Noone safe in these books.  Noone.I will say that this book, this series, totally deserves five stars.  I think of some books that I've given 5 or 4 stars to in the past and then care it to this book and they aren't even I'm the same league at all.The series has some harsh critics and as the series goes on some of their observations are correct.  But as far as the first book, it's as near a perfect book that I've read.It is violent. Very violent.  Be prepared for that and a lot of rape and pillaging. If you can't stomach that then this isn't the book for you\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Wow\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    What else can I say?I only started reading this book because I wanted to be familiar with the characters before I started watching the TV show.Well. My only experience with epic fantasy is with Tolkien and Jordan. I was a little hesitant to step into GoT because WoT became too ponderous to wade through by the sixth or seventh book. It took only a few chapters reading ASOFAI to where I would hold my breath at the end of a chapter before I pushed the Next Page button to see who the next chapter would be about. Some chapters I had to hold my hand over the page so I wouldn't read the bottom before the top!As I stated various places before, GoT is like WoT but with a fourth of the words, four times the action, and a fifth less magic.In other words, once I got past the introduction of the main players and who was married to whom, keeping track of who was doing what where and for or to whom, was not hard.Martin's fantasy world seems like a very real place in many ways. As usual thousands of years ago people came over on ships and conquered, then intermarried. The laws of physics and medicine are the same.Soon I was reading the book just to find out what was going to happen regardless of what the tv show was doing. There is a lot of violence and sex in this book, but I never felt it that was gratuitous.Yes bad things happen to good people in Westeros. Knowing that no character is safe ups the ante.Reading on the Kindle helps when I want to look up a character and see when we first met him or her, learn the meaning of an archaic word.From the first four episodes of the TV show, I can see that the script came right of the book. The TV show is great - the very first scene of men riding forth from the Wall, told me they \"got it\" when they made this TV series. People will be drawn in the visuals - of towers, cities, massed armies. And of course, all the gratuitous sex.The TV show will bring lots of new readers to these books. As great as the TV show is, the book is just so much better. If the show gets people to actually read these books, they will be pleasantly surprised.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Read that Leaves You Feeling Icky\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I feel dishonest only giving this book 3 Stars because the truth is I could not put it down and there is no doubt in my mind that I will end up reading this entire series. I enjoyed the complexity of the plots, the character development, the multiple perspectives, the detailed worlds, the unconventional blur between good/evil and the unpredictable plot twists. There is much in this book to enjoy and praise.That said I only gave this book 3 stars because it left me feeling, well, kind of disturbed. Multiple times, during the course of reading this book, I told whoever was around that I felt like I was being emotionally abused by the author. I usually like disturbing/dark stories but something about this one troubled me. For starters the sex and sexual violence in this book was a bit much for me. Almost all the sex scenes are about a thirteen year old child. The sexual acts that happen to Dany in this novel constitute at least a dozen felonies in any civilized society. Not only could I not discern a reason the author had to make Dany SO young (especially if he wanted her character to be highly sexualized) but the aspects of sex he chose to discribe and the manner in which he discribed them were random, weird and came across as nothing more than a perverted indulgence. I would read something and simultaneously roll my eyes while feeling an icky shudder up and down my spine. I have no problems with sex in books I read, but the manner in which the sex scenes were written in this book are not reflective of real life and left me feeling grossed out. They felt exploitive I guess because they were so gratutious and strange.Also, as a women, the constant rape and violence towards women was hard to read. I realize rape and misogyny are part of the world, particularly in times of war, but the amount and detail was hard to stomach. While the male characters (good and bad) generally die or get injured bravely in battle the women must be systemically humiliated before dying unceremoniously. Not only is raping them bad enough, they must be gang raped. And just in case gang rape wasn't degrading enough they have to be gang raped from behind. This combined with the constant womanizing of the main characters, the constant put downs related to the worth of women relative to men and after a while it makes you start to wonder; has Martin created a world filled with systemic female degradation because he is laying the foundation for an ultimate commentary on oppression, violence and human dignity? Or has he created a world filled with female degradation because that is what he likes writing about? I have 6 more books to read before I can answer that question but I have a suspicion it is the latter which is where the icky feeling I have towards this book comes from. Hopefully, it turns out I am wrong.Even though this book left a bad taste in my mouth in some respects, I will continue to read the series because it is wildly entertaining. I've already started the second book.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"7"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Still the best after all these years\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I first read George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones back in 1997, just after I graduated from college -- I had completed Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time (to that point), and was enticed by the Jordan blurb on the cover of the paperback. Combined with a fondness for George R.R. Martin's short stories and Wild Cards series as a teenager, I knew I should give it a chance. I remember being up late at my mother's house in the height of winter, feeling an odd chill as I finished the prologue, impressed by the mix of fantasy and horror. Of course, with its rich cast of characters, focus on politics, and subtle approach to magic, A Game of Thrones is much more than its prologue.In many ways, A Game of Thrones represents a tremendous paradigm shift in fantasy.  Characters are flawed, and central figures -- even protagonists -- can die horribly. We may take this for granted now, but in the late 1990's, fantasy was still largely wed to the Tolkien model. Not so after A Game of Thrones. Robert Jordan, David Eddings, Terry Brooks, et al, all seemed adolescent in comparison to Martin.I have since gone back and read it six times over the past 14 years -- whenever a firm date is announced for a new volume of a Song of Ice and Fire, I go back and re-read all the books in the series. The recent announcement of A Dance With Dragons for July 2011 is no different -- except this time, I'm reading the series on my Kindle and not in print. Fortunately, the typography and art translates well on the platform, and reading it on Kindle is very similar to reading it in print. Even knowing the story as well as I do, including through a recent screening of the first six episodes of the HBO television adaptation, I find there's still much to enjoy. The tragedy that befalls Ned Stark and his children is still as great as it was on first reading -- and the hindsight of the later books only helps to underline this.For many years, I have tried to find fantasy series that can compare, and though some come close, none have been able to match A Game of Thrones. And as good as the television series is, the source material is still better.  If you're still on the fence, you really have no excuse.  Read it. And don't complain about the Kindle price -- it's worth the $9.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The Best Fantasy Ever Written\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book is not the prototypical fantasy novel, but it is the best. It has in heaps and droves what many lack: verisimilitude. There are paragons of virtue, but they are not immune to the plotting of the wicked. There are villains as foul as any laid down in any fiction, but many express virtues when least expected. You see many sides to the story, and see many viewpoints. You could easily sympathize with the villains, so human are their motivations.In grand style and sweeping vision comes A Game of Thrones, the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. If you have ever read fantasy, this is the book against which all others will be measured. If you have not, then this is the book which will shatter the genre barrier. The story is riveting, the characters are complex and captivating. There is so much nobility, treachery, deceit, murder, and foreboding that it threatens to overwhelm, but that is the rollercoaster ride that Martin puts you on. By the end, you are virtually guaranteed to laugh, cry, and want to reach into the pages and strangle some of the characters, both good and evil, for the foolish mistakes they make or the wicked deeds they commit.This book is truly a once in a lifetime master work, not to be missed. The backdrop is a medieval setting that feels more historical than fantastic. Martin leaves powerful wizards and ancient magic orders to other novelists, and in its place gives you a realistic world that is at once both incredibly broad and amazingly detailed. But it is the characters that will have you wanting for more when the last page is turned, characters at once both noble and flawed, wise and foolish, evil but principled; never has a book characterized so many fascinating characters that all seemed so tangible.This book is a paragon of both art and artifice. It is well-written, to be sure: vividly imagined and artfully set to the page. Martin is a master of prose, and his style effortlessly flows from description to dialogue to flashback without ever wandering or wasting pages. But truly, it is the artifice that will capture you. There are so many plots and stories swirling about in this soup that it threatens to overwhelm the reader, but Martin steers you through adeptly, showing you many points of view, until both the characters and the story have truly come to life, which makes every victory and tragedy the characters experience your own to feel.You are forewarned: if you read this book, you will be swept away, and you will scarcely be able to put it down, nor any of its sequels, until you have devoured every morsel of this tasty literary meal.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A masterful opening book to a series...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I stumbled upon A Game of Thrones in 1997 when I walked by it and saw a quote on the cover from Jordan.  I liked Jordan and was really getting in to the genre so I thought why not.  It is perhaps one of the best random selections of a book/series that I have ever had, and since then am a die hard Martin fan (being one of my top two authors of the genre, the other being Erikson).  I'd recently had the pleasure of re-reading this one because of the HBO series as well as the fact that A Dance With Dragons was coming out.The book does not disappoint, never has.  The second go around, around 14 years after I first read it, was just as special as when I read it the first time.  The characters are so fleshed out and real that you can imagine them existing in real life.  The honorable yet stoic Starks in the North, protecting the realm from an age old, almost mythical threat.  The sinister and greedy Lannisters conniving for power.  The gluttonous King Baratheon who was once a proud and formidable knight.  The homeless Targaryen siblings feeling their way through an alien land yearning to return in triumph.  Let us not forget all the lesser houses and noblemen, the characters that help make Martin's world so colorful and alive.You cannot help but hate Jaime and Cersei, respect Eddard, and admire Tyrion's wit.  And yet despite all of this Martin writes everything in a way that leaves you wondering and doubting about how you feel about them.  He isn't afraid to kill off characters and illustrate political intrigue with a deft hand.  You finish A Game of Thrones shaking your head in anger or pumping your fist.  You finish A Game of Thrones feeling content, and yet you suddenly want to read the next in the series to find out what happens.  Treat yourself to Martin and immerse yourself in the lush, vibrant world.5 stars.PS The only possible downside that some readers suggest is that there are too many characters and that it gets too confusing.  I strongly feel that this style of writing, where each chapter follows a specific character's point of view (rotating through about 7 characters) only makes the narrative that much stronger.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Changed the fantasy genre for me!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book was one of the best I've read in a long time. I have never really been into the fantasy genre, but this changed that for me. Where I found \"Lord of the Rings\" hard to read and get into, I found this book to be the complete opposite of that.The way this book is done was different than I was used to. For starters, there are no chapter numbers. This drove me crazy at first, especially since I like to talk about the book with my friend. We always have to say \"That part where so-and-so did such-and-such\". It would have been nice to be able to say \"Chapter 14, towards the end\" instead. But really, that's my only real complaint about this book.Another thing that was different is that the story is told from the perspective of several different characters in the book, and each chapter is a different character, and later on that character is revisited by more chapters. This took some getting used to on my part, as did the vast number of characters. I actually had to print up a chart to help me organize who was who and who was related to who, but my short term memory isn't very good.The author's writing skill is good, in my opinion. This is something that matters to me after reading some other books where the story was good but the writing skill was bad. I don't let bad writing skill keep me from a good story, but it can be distracting. Thankfully, the author of this book writes well enough that I was able to slip right into the world that is created in the book.And oh, what a world it is. The book is just descriptive enough that you can immerse yourself and reality slips away around you. The characters are developed nicely and the plots (both the main one and the sub plots) are interesting and at times, surprising. Definitely not \"light reading\" by any means, yet vastly enjoyable.This book was really a feast for the brain, and it has totally change my opinion about the fantasy genre and has inspired me to give Lord of the Rings another try someday soon. But for now, I am eager to jump into the next book in this series, because it definitely leaves you wanting more.A note about the Kindle version: The Kindle version was very well formatted, I found no issues whatsoever.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \"In life, the monsters win.\"\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice may also be its most annoying. The first novel in the series, A Game of Thrones, often gets bogged down in the very description needed to create the vaguely medieval setting. Needless to say, the fantasy genre requires patience, and luckily this book delivers to those willing to overlook (or perhaps skim) some of the more overblown parts to be rewarded by the author's knack for spinning an unparalleled plot.The heart of the story boils down to the struggle for political domination as well as the more intimate struggles between families, friends, and lovers. The chapters alternate limited third-person viewpoints of a cast of approximately 20 different characters and the author doesn't play favorites. At any given moment George R. R. Martin may kill off an important character because that is how the cutthroat world of the novel works; fan favorites be damned.Surprisingly, the novel contains a wealth of strong female characters whose presence creates a fuller picture of the factors that contribute to a struggle for world domination on a planet where the Stark family motto, \"Winter is coming,\" adds a layer of complexity to the prospect of a cold spell that could last years and with it bring even darker times for humanity as well.The thematic element most integral to the foundation of the Fire and Ice series comes toward the end of A Game of Thrones when Sansa, Eddard Stark's daughter thinks, \"In life, the monsters win.\" What George R. R. Martin's fantasy series makes clear is that within everyone there is a monster and the reader will be continually torn by which character to side with. Luckily, the saga continues, and each reader will see a bit of themselves in the strengths and weaknesses of each character.The temptation to read A Game of Thrones arose only after a marathon session of watching all of the first season via HBO on Demand before the premiere of this April's season two premiere. It will be interesting to see how my perception of the series changes if I am able to read the third book BEFORE the premiere of the series' third season (which is said to only cover half of book three). In the meantime, I'll find some great fan sites and devote some time to studying character descriptions and plot summaries!JeriWB.com\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent story, but too many characters to wade through\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I really enjoyed this book. It is a fabulous story with rich, fully-developed characters and world building unmatched by any author I have read, with the exceptions of Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. Mr. Martin is a brave and ruthless author, as he has the guts to do what many authors do not: make their characters suffer! I respect that. Tyrion, Jon, and Eddard were my favorite characters. Arya is a close fourth. Viseyrs was my least favorite, and if someone tosses Lady Lysa off a cliff in one of the upcoming books, I won't lose any sleep.The criticisms: This book was ridiculously long, and it's not exactly a page-turner. The book gets interesting at about 50% completion, and takes off at abut 70% (the point where things change drastically, for Eddard (Ned)). The ending is well worth the wait; just know that with the exemption of the first few chapters, the middle of act one and middle of act two is going to be a slog. Also, there are just too many darn characters in this book! Yes, this is an epic fantasy with characters that cover the entire realm, but I don't think that every lord, maester, hired sword, and bannerman needed be asigned a name--it was dizzying. There were so many sers, lords and lady mothers that I just had no idea who was who, outside of the main characters (the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, the two living Tarygarens and a few of the Dothraki). I would be reading a scene, and in comes Ser Such and Such. Ser Such and Such has joined the conversation, confusing things because I haven't the slightest idea who this person is. Who's side is this person on? What is their motivation for their actions at this point of the story? Are they credible? Are they to be trusted? I don't know, because they hadn't been mentioned in 150 pages, and they weren't significant enough for me to remember anything other than I had heard their name in the story before. That is my major complaint in this story.Overall,  I am glad I read A Game of Thrones. The last 30% of the book was worth the long read! At this point I am not certain if I will read the next installment, only because the books are so long, and there is a critically acclaimed TV series that has supposedly done a good job in portraying the story. I think I'll go the easy route and watch the series.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Price-y for an e-book, but oh so worth it.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Though A GAME OF THRONES: A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a little pricey for an ebook that was published in 2003 (clocking in at $8.99 at my time of purchase), it is very much worth every penny.  Anyone who has watched the HBO series of the same name will benefit greatly from reading this novel. The first season of the television series closely follows the general plot and smaller details of the first book (even sometimes ripping dialogue straight from the pages of the book), but offers more insight into the characters. I watched the first two seasons and then decided to pick up the first book. I was pleasently surprised to see that the book's chapters (which are not numbered, which is its only negative, if I had to nitpick) plop you right in the mind of the chapter's  namesake. It almost feels like you're watching the show as you read. The KEY difference being: You are inside the character's head. You see things more intimately through them and get a better feel of their personality, feelings, and thoughts.  Aside from the improved POV, there are still some small plot differences and details that will keep the reader interested if they've already seen the show. It is a great augmentation to the television series. If you have trouble keeping all of the houses and sigils and mottos in order while watching the series, you'll have no problem after reading the book.  Something interesting that struck me nearly right away is that all of the characters are significantly  younger in the book than they are portrayed in the series. I suppose it goes against U.S. law to have minors do some of the things their would-be characters do in the book, so that doesn't bother me too much. If anything, it makes you sympathize with these characters' tribulations more.  If you have not watched the HBO series yet, reading this book before watching the series would be a great help. There are A LOT of characters from many houses and with  many different agendas. Having background knowledge from the book would help.  The book is interesting and colorful and keeps you  hanging on its every word. Excellent for male and female readers a like (there's something for everyone). This would be an excellent read at the beach or poolside.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Well-drawn characters, much blood, gore, and death\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George R.R. Martin knows how to get into the heads of his characters and convey who they are to his readers. In this novel, the chapters shift points of view among eight different characters, creating insight and empathy for each. Some of these characters are each other's enemies, many are children, some are underdogs, and all are very human. GRRM leaves it up to the reader to decide who earns their admiration or distrust, fondness or dislike. The many other significant characters are reflected through the eyes of those eight and are not as readily judged -- at least, not until they act in a manner that displays their true selves. Their true selves can be horrid.While a book about noble families competing for power cannot be tame, I found the ever-present threat of death, and the gruesome ways in which death could come about, hard to read when I cared so much about most of the main characters. I like the way GRRM writes, giving enough detail to clearly picture scenes in my mind yet not so detailed that I want to skip paragraphs. I like the direwolves and dragons, and I fear the Others. But though the world he created is still on my mind (and not having seen the HBO series), I do not want the next book or the one after to show me my favorite characters dying horribly or otherwise being mentally or physically tortured. I think I've seen enough in this book.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The first book of a massive series\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I had heard of A Game of Thrones through the reputation of the HBO series. I don't have an HBO subscription, so I don't plan to watch it. But I thought it might be fun to read the book. The novel isn't quite as focused on sex as the series is supposed to be. It has its share of both sex and violence, but all of the titillating aspects of the plot are justified in the written version. This is not a medieval Shades of Gray.The plot is a massive story with more characters than I could keep track of. There is a listing of names in an appendix at the back. If I had known it was there, I would have taken advantage of it and that might have helped. But the main characters were well defined and whatever confusion I had with the minor ones didn't affect my appreciation of the work.The story takes place during medieval times, in a world populated with lords, ladies, knights, and peasants. The fictional environment created by George R. R. Martin is realistically portrayed, but it branches off into mystical moments that are critical to the story. The shift from realism to mysticism is handled smoothly and fits well in the context of the story.The majority of the plot concerns the relationship of Eddard (Ned) Stark with King Robert Baratheon and the conflict between Ned's family, the house of Stark and the family of the King's wife Cersei, the house of Lannister. There is intrigue, deception, jousting, battles, and everything else expected from a story about a struggle for power in that period. I loved the excitement as the various plots progressed.The one thing I did not like about A Game of Thrones is that it doesn't stand on its own. Multiple subplots were left hanging when the book ended. I understand that it is part of a series, but it should still conclude the majority of the story lines. I want to know what happens to Arya and how Jon will fit in. Leaving something up in the air makes sense to me, but this book leaves too much unresolved. I plan to read the other books in the series, but I don't know how soon I'll get to them.Steve Lindahl - author of Motherless Soul and White Horse Regressions\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Solid Work\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have read only this first book in the series, but what I've seen so far has encouraged me to continue. I'll have to say that the most unusual feature of this book is the body count--not that it is excessive or gory, but that with it, the author kills off three major characters well before the end. And one of them was a character through whom Martin had been carrying one of the multiple points of view.Of the surviving characters, my least favorite is Joffrey, not just because he is an awful person but also because he is relentlessly awful. Counterbalancing him is Tyrion Lannister, who is crafty but clear eyed; my intuition tells me that as his fate goes, so will the currents that drive the rest of the characters in this book.Of course, any epic fantasy has to draw at least one comparison to Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_. The biggest point, I think, is the feel of the worlds that the authors have created. To me, Tolkien's world seemed completely organic, as if the story had grown out of the ground, and the author had harvested it. The complexity of the races, languages, history, calendars--in many ways, the appendix at the end of _The Return of the King_ is the most fascinating reading of the whole series. _Game of Thrones_, on the other hand, feels completely artificial, as if the author has set the characters down on a flat surface, wound their keys, and let them tumble as they may. Despite the eight-thousand-year history behind the story's current action, I sense a chasm between those times that has not yet been bridged. I'm not saying that this is a problem with the work. In one important way, Martin's world has a big advantage over Tolkien's: his characters are free to decide their own fates. If the deaths of three major characters in the first book doesn't tell the reader that anything goes, I don't know what will. In contrast, the characters in Tolkien's world are fated--fated to fight the big battles, fated to meet the most despicable villain of all, fated to win despite enormous odds. Tolkien's world, for all of its organic feel, has artificial action, while Martin's world, for all of its artificial feel, has natural action. I look forward to seeing who survives the second book.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"8"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    An eerie parallel with the Wars of the Roses\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I came to A GAME OF THRONES because I read (and write) historical novels set during the Wars of the Roses, so I wanted to see what this writer of epic fantasy would do to the material. I was pleasantly surprised to find that George R. R. Martin (I'll refer to him as GRRM) didn't slavishly follow the historical events, making this a refreshing read.Yes, I got that the Starks stand in for the Yorks (I guess Cateleyn is based on Lady Cecylee Neville, Duchess of York), and that the Lannisters stand in for the Lancasters. But everything has been mixed up, so that Robert Baratheon, who most resembles King Edward IV, is married to his greatest enemy Marguerite of Anjou (the Lancastrian Queen). Or perhaps Cersei Lannister is based upon his actual wife Elisabeth Woodville? Which makes Jaime Lannister what? Sir Anthony Woodville?Anyway, you get the idea. It's not easy to fit the actual history to this story, which gives GRRM a lot more freedom to develop his characters how he pleases.For a book with the requisite plot twists and turns, it was a pleasant surprise to read such wonderfully poetic prose. Here is an example of what I mean. We are in Catelyn Stark's head as she rides with her son and his army to cross the river at Riverrun:\"They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double column wound its way though the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank. Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle...\"Look at all those strong verbs: \"crossed,\" \"floated,\" \"wound,\" \"slithering,\" \"issue forth,\" \"rode.\" And how poetic the language is, with \"evenfall\" and \"horned moon.\" It is just enough to give a whiff of the Middle Ages without overdoing it. This long book, which I believe is about 700 pages (my iPad doesn't tell me), kept me royally entertained for a week. If you have a boring plane journey ahead of you and this sort of thing grabs your attention, get it for your iPad.

If the series is a close interpretation of the books, it's just as well I didn't see the series.I'll be the first to admit that I don't like Soap Operas and, to me, Game of Thrones was nothing more than a period piece soap opera. Too many characters and far too much whining. After pushing through 50% of the first novel, I gave up.  Obviously, based on the number of 4 and 5 star reviews and the popularity of the series, I may be in the minority.  That's fine. Not everyone's taste is the same. I do have to commend G.R.R. Martin for being able to drag this out and make a bloody fortune. Hats off to you Mr. Martin.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Dark and complex epic fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is an awesome book, an inspiration in the genre. It's powerful, complex, compelling, intelligent, and a solid read. In short, it's one of the best fantasy books you can buy.What's good about it? It introduces a very interesting and unique sort of plot that breaks convention, the morality is complex and ambiguous, the prose and mechanics of the writing are top notch, the style was gripping and sometimes humorous, dialogue is top of the line, the characters were very three-dimensional, and the sheer complexity of the work alone is an interesting element.Lastly, I liked the vast number of POV characters that the author introduced, rather than simply one. George Martin did a good job at showing the different viewpoints from different people and giving them all their own unique voice. Be ready to concentrate and remember while you read, though, because you'll need to keep track of a lot of different characters, not to mention the backstory, worldbuilding, and minor characters. The outline of the great houses at the back of the book is helpful for this.The pacing of the story wasn't extraordinary, but still good. If anything bothered me, it was the rather slow movement of the story. Though not bad, it would have benefitted by having things happen faster and having a little less detail. As it is, I think the author is enjoying himself too much as he writes the interaction between the characters, and wants to do it as much as possible. I also a minor quibble that Bran was a bit bland and lifeless, so his chapters seemed like a bit of a waste.A few words of warning: If you like your heroes and want them to live, this book may not be for you. There are enough characters that any of them might come out on top in the end, and Martin doesn't seem to think his books complete unless he kills at least two of them in each novel.There is also quite a bit of violence, language, and sexuality in this book. Though not quite as graphic or nasty as Terry Goodkind's series, it might turn off some readers, especially more sensitive ones.In conclusion, it's hard to go wrong with this book, which is currently one of the best in the genre. It's probably the best in the series, too, considering the direction the sequels go.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Best Adult Fantasy Series Ever.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have scanned some of the negative reviews of this book and it seems the common thread is shock over the adult content of the writing. Either that or outrage over the lack of a \"fantasy\" element.  It should be known that this book and this series is not G-rated Tolkien. Nor is this series a rambling fantasy epic where everyone has special powers a' la Jordan.What this book and subsequent series happens to be is some of the best writing in the fantasy genre I have ever read.  I have been reading fantasy for over 2 decades now and have never become so engrossed in any series as I have this one. True, I was a little put off at first by the lack of the \"fantasy\" element - I didn't expect a historically based fiction novel to hold my attention - but it did, and the further on in the series you go, the more \"fantasy\" comes into play.I read the Jordan series up until Winter's Heart and enjoyed the first 6 books or so but eventually realized that the story was going nowhere.  After reading Game of Thrones and the subsequent novels I finally grasped what good writing actually is. There are no cliche' characters in ASOIAF and no hokey actions like Nynaeve \"pulling her braid\" in anger.  Every major character is fully fleshed out and quite believable. The actions and reactions that lead to conflict are intelligent and understandable.  The \"adult\" content is not over-the-top and only adds to the immersion and believability of the world that Martin created.Admittedly, the series starts out a little slowly with this book but keep on reading and you will be glad you did. The plot twists Martin throws out are sometimes saddening and sometimes uplifting but when you finish a book you feel as if you lived it. This is by no means a feel good fantasy series where the good guy always wins and no one gets hurt. This is a novel that describes what a medevil world must really be like if thrown into conflict with unknown forces as well as other Houses.I could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself.  If you are looking for a fantasy series that will keep you yearning for the next book and if you really want to see what quality writing is like, I recommend starting with A Game of Thrones.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    In which a world is built, fascinating characters are created, and intelligent plotting is spun\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    In which George R.R. Martin manages the impressive feat of building a massive world, establishing dozens of complex characters and their relationships, setting up a labyrinthine plot full of political machinations and complicated motivations, and does it all while managing a pace that keeps the reader absolutely hooked into his world. Martin has his work cut out here; the world of Westeros is a huge and complex one, and by starting his work essentially in medias res (that is, there is a vast amount of backstory that influences each of the characters), he only makes that more difficult. Add into that the choice to tell the story entirely through third-person limited perspectives (each chapter is confined to a single character's viewpoint, and the choices of character are limited), and you might wonder how Martin can manage to make this all work. The remarkable thing is, not only does he succeed, the book is absolutely masterful, juggling all of the difficult tasks in such a way that you quickly forget about them and simply immerse yourself in the tapestry Martin has made. There's lots to praise about Game of Thrones, but first and foremost, there are Martin's characters, all of whom defy easy characterization or simple description, but live and breathe all the more effectively for that choice. More than that, Martin brings a maturity and intelligence to his plotting, trusting his readers to be able to follow the various story threads and piece together the motivations even when they may not seem immediately clear. It's a mature and thoughtful take on the fantasy genre, which no doubt explains much of the appeal; in a genre that so often becomes synonymous with adolescent fantasies, it's a joy to find one with true depth and nuance. My only real regret is not waiting longer between my viewing of the first season of the outstanding HBO series before reading it; the adaptation is so faithful that it was hard sometimes to judge the book as its own entity. But I'll also say this: reading this has left me eager to see what else Martin has up his sleeve, and makes me question my decision to wait for the second season of the show.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Saga's Epic Start\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Game of Thrones is the excellent first installment in George R.R. Martin's epic A Song of Ice And Fire series. It introduces the continent of Westeros, where the fifteen year peace between seven kingdoms under King Robert Baratheon is growing tenuous. Add to this the stirring of malevolent supernatural forces in the wilds of the north, the reappearance of the exiled bloodline of the Mad King whom King Robert overthrew to gain control of the continent, and an impending winter as long and brutal as an ice age, and it's easy to understand how Martin's tale ballooned from a trilogy to an expected seven volumes.Martin sews this expansive tapestry with eight narrative threads. Six belong to the House of Stark from the northern most kingdom of Winterfell. The Starks find themselves in the center of the quickly escalating tensions in Westeros and are torn apart by duty, betrayal, and fate. Daenerys, the end of the usurped Mad King's bloodline, is wed to the leader of a nomadic people, the Dothraki in a misbegotten attempt by her brother to raise an army to take back the crown, and struggles to persevere amongst these brutal tribes in a land a sea away from Westeros. Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister the dwarf brother of the nefarious Cersie, who is married to King Robert, slowly rises from black sheep to a central player in the Lannister power grab.While Martin's story is certainly complicated, it's told with a style and structure that beguiles and delights, always drawing the reader further in with fast pacing and clean prose. Comparisons to J.R.R. Tolkien are not unfounded. But while Martin's world certainly competes with Middle Earth as a fabulously detailed, astoundingly elaborate, carefully constructed fantasy realm, Tolkien's hobbits and dwarves are crude sketches compared to the nuanced, gray shading that goes into Martin's characters. The cast of Martin's saga possess rich inner lives with motivations too human to make most characters simply good or evil. It's the mix of complex characters and a grittily realistic fantasy realm that make Martin's saga so unforgettable and unpredictable.A Game of Thrones is as close as fiction gets to being a completely rapturous experience and, upon completing the final chapter, it is a tremendous thrill to know it is only end of the beginning.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Gee I'm not the first reviewer?\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Okay so the book has been out for a *while* and there have been lots of reviews, but wanted to add my thumb's up as well.I've been buying the books since they were released, telling myself that I would read them all once the series was finished since I didn't want to have to reread between books. I finally gave in and read this because of the HBO series, which I am really enjoying. Enjoying so much that I was happily picturing the images from the show as I was reading the book. I didn't want the show to get ahead of me so I finished the book tonight.By now you've heard a lot about the series - and it's true, there are many diverse plots and story lines. Although it's almost 900 pages, there is not a wasted word - the action is steady and the book a page-turner, especially by  midpoint when I could not put it down.I have long been a fan of high fantasy novels, and one of my favorite authors is Guy Gavriel Kay and his fantastic novel \\n  \\nTigana\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n     One of the things I like about Kay's novels is that the magic is not used as deus ex machina - the characters have to use their wits to get out of trouble. In fact there is not a lot of magic in these books, although there is some with lots of prophesy and foreshadowing.But don't assume that this prophesy and foreshadowing means you will know what will happen -  you won't. There are lots of intriguing and surprising plots twists and turns in this book, and no one is safe.Add to the action and intrigue is lots of humor, brought to you by a dwarf named Tyrian. He may be my favorite character in the book, and that's saying a lot.Highly recommended.  Obviously.*forgot to add that I read some comments that people had problems with the Kindle edition - maybe they've fixed them because I read this on my Kindle and it was just fine.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    My life is ruled by a dwarf, a bastard, and a cripple\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Not sure how many ways I can idolize a book or a series.

In that 6 months I read nothing else.Perfect books draw you into the story until the characters become real and part of your friends.  After you quit the book, you grieve because you no longer spend time with your friends.  This is that type of book.Perfect books have complex characters.  Assuming that \"Avatar\" is the epitome of one-dimensional characterization, I can assure you that GOT is pretty much diametrically opposite to this practice.  I love a character.  I hate the character.  I am ambivalent towards the character.  Even tho I'm ambivalent I can't wait to see what happens to them.  Good characters are bad; and bad are good.  Convention is never drawn.If I were to nitpick?  On Kindle, you can't read the blasted maps.  Characters carouse, march, and muster all through a new world and you are pretty much clueless as to if it is a far cry or a short hop.  Imagine reading LOR and not knowing where Bilbo is or where he is going.Also, GRRM writes the books in sequential chapters that follow different characters.  All chapters end on a bit of a cliffhanger.  You will then need to read 2-20 chapters to pick up the thread.  Consequently, I read the books out of order.  I followed the character throughout (skipping chapters merrily) until I came to the end of their story and then read the next chapter, picked up the next character, and then read only their story.  I do NOT recommend this practice and hope to hell you have more self-control than I did and eschew this filthy habit.  Read it in order.  Makes much more sense that way.Have recommended this series only to people who love reading, as not everyone will commit to multi-thousand page sagas.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"9"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Gritty Epic Fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \"A Game of Thrones\" is book one of the series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", and I think it is an excellent epic fantasy story.

There are certain characters that I really enjoy reading about such as Jon, Arya, Bran, and Tyrion. The other characters aren't quite as interesting to me, but they do advance the story.Another aspect of the story I like is the grittiness of the characters. There doesn't seem to be a clearly defined good versus evil although there is a lot of talk about honor and doing one's duty. There are some truly evil characters that I loathe, and I eagerly look forward to them meeting justice for their despicable actions.The book hints at magic use, but only features it a couple times. There are some hints of what I would call mysticism with references to older times when magic abounded, and the ability to peer into the future/sense things going on in other parts of the realm. I also got the sense that there might be some magic left in the world, and it may come out more in later stories.As a word of warning, the book includes some graphic, violent scenes in the form of war, executions, and sword fighting.

I came by this book because of the HBO series and I am glad I did. I never Heard of George R.R. Martin before. I have heard people compare this series to tolkien's work and I agree it is as masterful but I find GRRM's writing much more interesting. I started reading this book on my Kindle blissfully unaware of how many actual pages there are in this novel, 858 by my kindles count. I am a fairly slow reader and I finished this book in a little over three weeks. I have never even read a non fiction work this long in my life. I could not put the book down. I became so enamoured with the characters that I didn't even notice how long it was. I found myself spending as much of my free time reading this as I could.I am astounded by the sheer complexity of the world GRRM has built and the characters within it. I thoroughly enjoy the way the narrative changes in each chapter. I am also watching the series on TV and it doesn't do the book justice. The book is so filled with vivid descriptions and internal thoughts of the characters that the series can only imply. I am already reading A Clash of Kings. I started yesterday only 12 hours after I finished Game of Thrones. Some people may not like the narrative switching but I think it adds depth and complexity to the characters and to the overall story. I will be buying and reading the entire series and when I am done with that I will be seeking out other books written by George R.R Martin.This is the first novel I have read in a long time that had such interesting characters. Like another review said the characters aren't the black and white, good and bad medieval characters of normal fantasy novels. They are like real people, a mix of all that is good and bad, intelligent and ignorant and sometimes all at the same time. The story itself is full of little twists and turns and things don't happen as expected in most circumstances yet for me the story is very enjoyable.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"10"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Dense But Extremely Rewarding, Even After Seeing the HBO Show\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Like many others, my first exposure to A Game of Thrones was the excellent HBO television series.  After watching through the third season and hearing people get into heated debates about beloved and hated characters, departures from the book and predicted future events, I decided to begin reading Martin's series myself.I must say that it has been a very satisfying experience reading this first book, despite the fact that I already knew what was going to occur.  While the show does a great job at portraying events, reading the book will make the history of Westeros and the motivations behind the characters' actions much more clear.  Faces and names that run together on TV become much more distinct as you read about the individuals themselves, their houses, their religions and their culture.  I found this to be particularly true for secondary \"brute\" characters like Sandor and Gregor Clegane, Bronn, Yoren and others.  (Heck, I even sometimes found Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy and Robb Stark difficult to tell apart on my first run through the TV show, too, but maybe that was just lazy viewing.)Martin's book also has no \"budget\" limitations, so there are quite a few passages here - dreams, direwolves, and an intense battle - that come across much more spectacularly than they do in the HBO show.To state the obvious, this is not a book for youngsters, nor is it \"light\" reading.  Grim events unfold one after the other and your favorite characters will die (yes, even here in book one).  You'll also have to keep track of well over one hundred characters, consult the appendix in the back, and reread passages to get the full effect of the narrative.  Even so, none of it comes off as unnecessary complication but rather a rich tapestry where every detail has its purpose.In summary, I'd highly recommend this book to everyone, no matter whether you are deep into the TV series or are merely interested in seeing what all the hype is about in the first place.  And I'm looking forward to moving on to book 2 in the series!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"10"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    All I can say is...

From the fast paced prologue, Game of Thrones, opens up into a diverse and amazing story of action, romance, politics and betrayal.Game of Thrones has a unique style to it. The story is not linear at all but rather the story is seen through the eyes of many different characters. Each with his/her own personality, trials and triumphs. Martin brings you into each one of these character's lives but only as you read further on do you really begin to know them truly. At times it can get confusing though, for each of these main characters also has his/her own story and people in their life that might not carry on from character to character. Others fill in through out the other characters. Needless to say, there is a lot going on so watch out. I had to go back and reread certain chapters to clarify what is happening. It is detail rich!With that said, look at a map. Westeros is a big world with lots of cities and lands and people.I do want to warn the future reader that this book contains a lot of adult situations. There is a lot of sex, references to it and detailed scenes as well as language. I did not want to take off a star for this because it is actually very well placed and not over done. I would even say it needs to be there for the story and characters to develop. If you are bothered by this then maybe this book would not be for you. If you can over look it, then this book will be worth every second spent reading it.*Edit 8/17/12*Well, I am almost done with he series now (just about to start the fifth book) and if I were to describe it in one word it would be committed. Game of Thrones is the toughest series I have ever read. At times (after book three) I was bored, I'll be honest, but other times I could not turn the pages fast enough.

I even enjoyed the controversial 8th season. Having watched the show certainly helped with the imagination while reading. Still I was amazed by the writing. Every single character whether it was lord, lady, boy, girl, dwarf, bastard, or eunuch was written from the eyes and mind of those individuals. Martin goes seamlessly from the thoughts and goals of the wiser elder Lord Stark, to the immature, naive, flighty thoughts and desires of a preteen Sansa Stark. The mindset and language used are consistent for the character of focus. You not only are transported from our world to Winterville, Westeros, or Essos, you are further transported to these worlds perceived by each character from chapter to chapter.  Character development is impeccable. The story makes sense because you know and understand each character, who they are, where they're from, how they think, what they want, and why they want it. There is little to no effort to suspend reality in order to beleive in this world of kings, queens, dragons, and undead, to follow a storyline of betrayal, greed, power, sex, life, and death.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was \"Middle Ages Fantasy\" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong.Of course they weren't wrong.What George R.R. Martin has done here defies genre, period. It doesn't matter if you're like me and don't care for this sub-genre of fantasy... it doesn't matter if your like my spouse, and don't like fantasy at all. If you enjoy brilliant, incredibly-developed, thought-provoking stories... those with a strongly developed cast of characters who blissfully lack being \"good vs. evil\" and instead all display their shades of grey, good traits, evil traits, unique traits, all sorts of traits... then this book is for you.

Don't get too attached to anyone, 'cause you never know what might happen.This book (bk 1) takes place in a medieval world that used to have magic and mythical creatures in it, but no longer does. However, what you begin to see as the series continues, is that the magic is beginning to return and what it brings with it. The plot and subplots are filled with intrigue. The characters are calculating and manipulative. Every time you finish reading about one character, you just wish you could skip ahead and see what happens to them, but then you start the next section and you want to keep going with that one instead! This is no cookie cutter fantasy book. It is NOT predictable. I'm so glad I found it late in the series, because I love reading a series with back to back books and I would have dreaded waiting three years between books!

Sure, sure, my dopey geek fantasy role playing friends couldn't stop praising it, making me want to read it even less.  Then I saw HBO was doing it as a series, AND the Fantasy Flight card game was getting huge reviews and I figured I'd better give it a second look.At first I was put off by the \"Ser this and that\" and the \"heraldic\" prose, but after a few chapters I got to know the characters and I must say I was BLOWN AWAY.  This darned Martin dude can really turn a phrase.  The world he has created is fully formed, and the characters are 3 dimensional (well, the main characters, anyway.  He gives names to thousands of bit players who could get by with just a description like \"a courtier entered the room\" instead of \"Frogbottom Leafhelm entered the room\".  Once you get used to this style, however, it does add to the ambience but it can be confusing who you're supposed to be paying attention to.)Anyway, this story takes some great and unexpected turns, and Martin uses some very advanced techniques to move the story forward quickly.  I liked this series so much I bought it for my best friend's kindle account because he's too lazy to download it himself but I think he'll enjoy it if I hand it to him on a silver platter.I love this book, and the series, and I've grown to basically hate the fantasy genre over the last few years because I've gotten burned buying stuff that looked interesting but stunk up the room.  Songs of Fire and Ice: Game of Thrones is a very notable and welcome exception to the loads of excrement that call themselves \"Fantasy Novels\" out there today (oh, don't go all ballistic on me...I know there's some good stuff still out there, I'm just being hyperbolic for effect. :-))your pal,LobstaPS: If you like this, do check out the Fantasy Flight card game, also sold by Amazon.com.

It is a real page-turner, You can't help but want to keep reading to find out what happens next. For me, I'd say ok I will finish the chapter and call it quits but I got so wrapped up that 1 chapter became 3, and the next thing I know I've read 200+ pages in one sitting.I truly highly recommend this book. It's written to perfection with rich and compelling characters.

What it is is a fantastic \"True\" fantasy. In Mr. Martins world there are no clear villains and heroes. Oh yes, you will find the righteous honor of Lord Stark and the undeniable villainy of the House Lannister, but you will see both those sides bend to the other.The world of Westros is cold, especially where it is warmest. The great king Robert won his throne with the help of his childhood friend Lord Eddard Stark, now he needs his help to keep it. The book is littered with unspeakable tragedies and few triumphs. However, this is the first book in the series and guaranteed to get you hooked if nothing else, to see the characters you root for most to get some justice. Characters are deeply developed and continuing to develop as they grow up before your eyes. There are vast houses and names for all, richly described down to the small-clothes. History becomes a big part of the fantasy which makes me think one day Mr. Martin will grace us with a Silmarillion of his own.This book may seem hard to get through at first, and for some it will be. Chapters are long, so much to remember and many things difficult to pronounce (however, HBOs new series of the Same name will help with that). It can be done easily, all you have to do is give yourself to the story. Become Eddard, or Tyrion and you will find yourself among people you've known your whole life. You'll fight there battles, grieve the fallen and weave the spells that will make you believe in this beautiful world.It may not remain your favorite, you might find that in one of the other amazing books offered up to you afterword but you will always remember this one as the start of your journey to save the world of men from the evil monsters-and themselves.5 out of 5...read it now and thank me later.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Incredible Book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Pros:+ A well rounded, complex set of characters.+ Feels different from your standard fantasy fare.+ Fluid, descriptive writing style.+ Gritty, realistic, etc.Cons:- The book becomes less interesting as the characters separate from one another.- Moves the story (or stories) along very little for an 800 page book.Set in the shockingly complex and realistic kingdom of Westeros, this book follows the conflicts of a dizzying array of people and houses. This has got to be the best fantasy novel that I have read in a good long time.  This book is not typical of the genre.  Gone are the clear distinctions between good and evil and you won't spend the whole book waiting for the sections with that interesting grey character because every character is grey. It is possible to sympathize with each of the nine point of view characters, but each of them also have very obvious flaws and quirks which are heightened by them being viewed through the lens of the others.The book largely deals with the conflicts and political jockeying of great houses and it has a quite a realistic feel to it.  There are a few fantasy creatures such as direwolves, but in general, you get the impression that magic is something that existed in the past and may in fact exist in the present, but it is hard to pin down how to use it or when it is being used.  Most of the more fantastic elements remain on the periphery of the story.The length of the book helps Martin introduce the world and characters to a huge extent.  Some readers, however, may find Martin's slow story development off putting.  Also, the story reaches its most interesting points when these marvelously developed characters interact with one another, but as the story goes on, they become separated and this happens less and less often.  Daenerys is separated from the other point of view characters entirely.Overall, though, this is a marvelous book with few flaws.  The political machinations that pit Stark against Lannister are both fascinating and personal.  You will likely find yourself loving two characters that are constantly played against one another, making reading this book a nuanced and thought provoking experience.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Brilliant Read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    ** spoiler alert ** I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this series by George R.R. Martin. The sophisticated marriage of sci-fi, fantasy and historical genres was well-done. I will say that I did myself a disservice by watching the HBO series before reading this book. While the book was fantastic and entertaining, after about 400 pages I was a bit bored since I already knew what was going to happen. On the other hand, without the foundation of the TV series, I probably would've been a bit puzzled with so many story lines being tied together. I can see that all of the story lines and different perspectives may be problematic for me as I read the next books. Too much bouncing around. However, if not too many new character's perspectives are introduced, I'll probably survive the next book.\"When people play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\" --> If only poor Ned had understood this! It made me a bit upset that his pride and excruciatingly high sense of morale caused him to lose the \"game.\" Alas, the old saying goes that \"nice guys always finishes last,\" or in this case, dead. Martin certainly proved the previous aphorism to be correct. I applaud the author's bravery in killing off central characters regardless of the reader's connection to them.The imagery that Martin is able to express via carefully chosen descriptions is applaudable. I love the world(s) that he creates and his ability to *not overdo it*. Just enough fantasy and mythical elements to pique interest, rife with mentally unstable despots, a heavy dose of brutality and sexuality, with a smattering of romance, all shrouded in an almost familiar historical context. Kudos. The world presented in GoT is believable. The characters are guaranteed to evoke some type of reaction from the reader - whether it be adoration, love or pure hatred. And the interwoven stories leave you wanting more. If only the page count was under 600, ah well.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Medieval fantasy at its best!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I'd heard wonderful things about the series, some even going so far as to warn me, \"You will never be able to enjoy another series of books with the same fervor because those books are THAT good.\" It is so true that the minute I finished reading a A Game of Thrones, I headed to the Kindle Store to download A Clash of Kings.The very first chapter of this book sucked me in with a chilling promise of fretful darkness in a world where you can't just turn on the lights to get away from the shadows. Set in a time and place not unlike medieval Europe, the narrative is divided chapter by chapter, allowing us to enter into several of the book's critical characters and follow the thread of their journey. As difficult as it might seem to take us on this trip through the eyes of at least nine different characters, Martin manages to weave the entire story together fluidly, and not once did I find myself feeling lost or confused when the POV shifted with a new chapter.Every character that lent voice to the story drew me into their world and made me feel for them, even the dwarf Tyrion Lannister, with his dark view and blatant honesty in a world all-to-unwilling to see the truth. Bran Stark became a favorite character early on, as I watched the world grow dark and tainted to his child's eyes, but failed to snuff the flame of the adventurer inside him. I quickly fell in love with Princess Daenerys Targaryen, whose older brother pushed her around all her life, threatening and mistreating her until she rose and found the power of the dragon inside her.By and large, A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I've read since finishing Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon many, many years ago. It is a book I will read over and again for the rest of my life, just for the pleasure of revisiting old friends and living through their adventures with them again.Five out of Five Stars without hesitation.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fantastically realistic world\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I've never been a great fan of fantasy books, but this one is absolutely brilliant.These are real people in a not that fantastic world. In this book there are no heroes, no villains. Everything is relative to the View point character.Every chapter is told by the character's point of view, with the character's knowledge and the character reactions to every event in this amazing story.You don't have the typical fantasy character archetypes, but more realistic characters that are not trying to defeat evil, they are all trying to get their way for their own interests or ideals. Loved the fact that the main characters are not \"the brave and good looking knight\" and the ruthless ugly villain. Tyrion the dwarf, Arya the boyish girl and Daenyares the feminist leader are great alternatives to the typical type of characters. Honor and good is not rewarded as one would expect in this kind of books, selfish and greedy characters usually get their way with things.There is magic in this world, but it is not the most important thing. Dragons and creatures are part of the world, not as magical creatures but real animals that live or lived there. Magic is as real as in our world, with people that believe in it and people that are more skeptic.There is a lot of exposition of an amazing back story with a lot of mysteries and legends that makes you want to know more and more about it and how this has impacted in the current world and the characters of the story.Its a long book, some times the pace of the story is slower that you would like, but it's really enjoyable to read the different view point characters reactions to the events.I recommend this book to people that wants to read a great political, social medieval conflict with a touch of fantasy on it, if you are disposed to read the 800 pages long this book is.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Intriguing, fun read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    1) fast shipping2) perfect condition3) Excellent story line as thick and colorful as a soap opera. I started reading Game of Thrones after I saw the HBO series and fell in love with the dynamic characters.  Martin's female characters are all strong and sometimes cruel and wicked.  It's not very often fantasy novels (or any novel for that matter) has a wide array of strong, female leads.If you are coming to this book after seeing the series like I did, know that it follows season 1 of the Game of Thrones exactly.  Or I should say HBO follows Martin's first novel in the series exactly - practically word for word, scene for scene.  This has a dual effect. a) the book seems boring as there are no surprises after watching the TV show, however,  b) as a fan, it's wonderful to see Hollywood (or HBO in this case) to honor a book for the masterpiece that it is and to not glamorize or bastardize it.  Any fan of the book would be excited to see the small screen bring their characters to life in such. Isn't that one of the biggest complaints readers have?  We get excited to see how  are heroes on the page are brought to life, but are usually disappointed - at least I am  (examples: X-men, World War z, etc.)So, if you are picking up the book after seeing the series, there will be no surprises. (though apparently Martin cannot find another simile for red other than blood nor can he not mention \"winter is coming\" for longer than 20 pages. Sigh.  give it a break, Martin! I heard you the first hundred times)If you are reading this book without having been acquainted to the TV series then be prepared for hundreds of characters, fast moving plot lines, witty characters, megalomania, and political corruption and deception. The plot never stagnates.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Epic and Tragic\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I heard about A Game of Thrones like many people that have recently read the book, from the HBO series.  A bit of warning to new readers.  The author pushes you right into the deep end from the start.  People or places or events mentioned may not be brought back up or explained until later in the book.  There are A LOT of characters and it is easy to get you houses and family members mixed up.  With that being said if you can make through the first 100 pages you will be set for the rest of the book.  The main storyline is set a few decades after a bloody rebellion in which the rebels defeated House Targaryen (the current ruling house) and set a new king on the throne.  You follow the story of 4 Houses, House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and the remnants of House Targaryen.  Character development is some of the best I have ever read.  Most of the characters are not only changed from the beginning to the end of the novel, they have been drastically changed from the events.  Fight scenes were executed marvelously and the action was pretty much nonstop for the majority of the book.  Moral choices for the characters pop up at every turn and at times you even question yourself at what you think is right.  A Game of Thrones is one of the few novels I have read that really got me emotionally involved with the story.  I really care for the characters and felt genuine remorse (and excitement in some cases) for the death of characters who did not make it.  This novel is not for the faint of heart as there is a lot of adult content, such as sex, rape, murder, war, and so on.  After putting down this book I have started right into A Clash of Kings as I could not wait to continue this grand adventure.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Once you start, you can't stop!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was a little hesitant at first, about reading a fantasy novel as I hadn't read one since Lord Of The Rings 30 years ago. But as it came so highly recommended from my middle son and so many of his friends, how could I not!I am eternally grateful to them for being so insistent!The characters have true character and depth.  You love them, you hate them; you laugh with them, you cry with them; you cry for them. It is a roller coaster of emotion and adventure. The story line is truly gripping and I can honestly say that once you start, you can't stop and there are 5 books all up (so far). The 4th book was about to be published when I started reading this series for the first time.  Now that book #5 has been released I am starting from the beginning again (good excuse) so I can remember it all (as there is so much happening) and relive every moment so as to truly appreciate this next book.For those of you that are not into fantasy, you should still give it a try as I found it to be more like a setting in Medieval times and certainly not 'over the top' fantasy.It mainly follows the Stark's of Winterfell, who's kingdom is surrounded by a protective wall, which is manned by the Night's Watch, keeping them safe from the wildlings and the Others. But to the vast frozen north, something supernatural and sinister is brewing and has to be stopped before it breeches their security.  Thus begins the epic adventure full of mystery, intrigue, love, loss, tragedy, victory, assassins and betrayal.This is an epic masterpiece.  So beautifully written with believable characters and plots of such wonderful depth.I highly recommend this book, and all the books in this series, to everyone; whether you are a fantasy lover or not.  I doubt very much that you'd be disappointed!  Rather, I think you'll be extremely grateful!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Not your typical fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Game of Thrones is basically review-proof; the series already has a large fanbase that continues to grow due to the HBO series. This is a more \"realistic\" fantasy, set in a world not unlike medieval Europe; magical creatures are largely considered myths or extinct. With the more grounded world-building also comes the more unpleasant aspects of the society; there are depictions of brutal battles, torture, executions, incest, and rape.The story follows the Stark family, feudal lords of the northernmost part of the realm. Patriarch Eddard Stark is tapped by the current king to serve as the \"hand,\" in essence taking care of the day to day aspects of governing the realm. While at court, Eddard soon discovers a conspiracy that may have been orchestrated by the power-hungry Lannister family. Meanwhile, Daenerys, the last princess of the recently deposed Targaryen dynasty, finds herself in an arranged marriage overseas to a powerful nomadic leader as her brother schemes to take back the throne for himself.In many ways this a subversion of most fantasy stories; a heroic major character fails in his task partly due to his or her own trusting nature. A young girl's dreams of being a princess are shattered by a harsh reality where she is faced instead with a cruel, brutal prince. The story ends with multiple factions preparing for war amongst themselves, unaware of a possibly worse supernatural threat.Although the story may seem bleak at times, there's a lot of intriguing stuff that make me want to keep reading. A massive wall of ice exists to keep unknown threats out of the realm, which includes a supernatural force of animated corpses. There are some pretty memorable characters, such as snarky dwarf (a human, not the fairy0tale kind) Tyrion, and Eddard's rebellious daughter, Arya. Martin's world-building is also top-notch, and definitely succeeds at creating a believable universe for these characters. I will definitely be reading the next book.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Interesting Twist on Fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is the only book I've read in the series, so bear that in mind as you read on.As far as \"Game of Thrones,\" there were some things I liked, some things I disliked.World Building: Martin's world is well-painted and believable - largely based off European medieval-ism (though historically inspired by the War of Roses). He obviously knows his history and has painted well the gritty reality of centuries past. There are gods in this world, but whether they exist or not is left ambiguous. It is a twist on much fantasy literature, where gods and goddesses galore intervene in the affairs of the world. There is magic, but is mostly alluded to - it's hinted that magic played a larger role in the past than it does in the present age.Most fantasy I've read follows a rags to riches story - unknown boy becomes great hero, saves the day - Frodo Baggins, Rand Al'Thor, Richard Cypher, etc, etc. Not here. It follows the workings of the nobles from the get-go, and hardly ever gives attention to the peasantry or lower classes. But it's interesting to read fantasy where we get a high-low view rather than the low-high view.In all, the world building is very unique, compared to other fantasy novels. Not to say it's completely devoid of cliches - \"an evil storm brewing in the north behind some sort of wall\" has been done a lot.Characters: What irked me about \"Game of Thrones\" were the characters. Not that they were bad, or unbelievable...I just found it hard to root for any of them, because very little of them stand for what is good (and if they do, they are punished for it...severely). I like how Martin is challenging the cliche of fantasy = good vs. evil, and instead going for \"realistic,\" yet, at the same time, I prefer characters that are good, believe in the power of good, and we will fight for THAT instead of their own selfish motives and ambitions. There are people like that in the real world, though they admittedly have their faults, so it's not exactly \"unrealistic.\"I know moral ambiguity is sort of the \"point\" of this series, but personally, I prefer a happy ending. I'm not saying \"Game of Thrones\" is bad because of this...it's just a preference. Perhaps Martin could have handled this better to convert people like me, but maybe I'm asking too much.Plot: Martin's book suffers from the get-go what Robert Jordan suffers from \"Dragon Reborn\" onward...too many points of view going on at once. Even in a huge book like Game of Thrones, you can't develop eight characters when each of them only gets a short time on the stage. There are no main characters in Game of Thrones, so instead of feeling personally connected with them, you are like a distant observer watching a tragedy unfold. Maybe this is a good thing, because the book would otherwise be more depressing than it already is. When good characters died and evil triumphed, I found myself not caring either way. I feel like this could have been solved had Martin cut out some of the points of view, leaving only Eddard, Tyrion, and Dany, and perhaps Arya, who I found to be the most interesting and personal. If he had focused on and developed these more, the book would have been better. I wonder whether Martin cut some lives short - not out of \"realism,\" but because too many threads were weaving a literary Gordian Knot.By the way, the strongest story arc is Dany's. It won a Hugo award for a reason. Though her ending was kind of WTF.I could have gone in greater detail. Get Game of Thrones if you're looking for something different - whatever you think of it, you can't deny it's a cliche buster of a fantasy novel.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"11"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent Audio Version\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE AUDIO VERSION ONLY:I love listening to \"books on tape\" or CD or whatever.  I have always liked listening to someone read a story from as long as I can remember, and this book is one that I could not stop myself from listening to.When I opened the box, I was surprised to see that the book was 28 discs long, I think this is due in large part to the length of the book and also the pace at which it is read.I will not comment on the story itself except to say that it it extremely engaging and there were many times I had to sit in the truck to finish up a part of the story before getting out for home or work.  I assume that if you are looking at the audio version, you are already somewhat familiar with the story itself.The book is read by Roy Dotrice who sounds like an old English nobleman himself, and I believe does a good job keeping up with the different voices.  Some of them sound alike, but there are so many characters, I think that is forgivable.  The cover says he holds a worlds record for the number of characters he portrays in this book.One reviewer noted that his women's voices were poor, but that is because it is an old man trying to make his voice sound like a little girl.  He does notably change his inflection when those characters speak, so it is not as if he is just monotoning his way through their parts.In conclusion, if you have 50+ hours of commute or travel time coming up and you are at all interested in this book, I do not think you will be disappointed with what you hear.  Hearing this story really brings it to life in a way that reading it did not, and Dotrice does an excellent job of bringing Martin's characters and world to life.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Game of Thrones is Irresistible Reading\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Unless you have lived in a mountaintop monastery in the Far East, you are familiar with George R. R. Martin's series, A Song of Ice and Fire, of which \"A Game of Thrones\" is part one. This fantasy novel sets the stage for the mythical land of Westeros, introducing many, many characters, their various holdings, castles, retainers, wives, children, and bastards. Of prime importance in this first novel are the Starks, who are honorable, loyal, brave, and dutiful; and the Lannisters, who are deceitful, ambitious, and cold-hearted. Upon first reading the novel, one is quickly over-whelmed by the numerous characters, their ancestors, and their children and siblings. In fact, I found it so over-whelming that I was wishing for a list of characters at the beginning to keep them straight. Well, I cheated, and wanted to know if the book ended as the HBO series did, and looked at the back pages. Ah, ha! There I found hiding \"An Appendix,\" full of family trees, and back stories. I struggled all the way to page 613 before I found it. This amazing book is otherwise well-written with strong, well-developed characters, and changes of vivid locale enough to maintain one's interest. There is intrigue galore, epic battles, kidnappings, and heartbreak. This first novel (of seven total)  introduces the grand stage upon which an epic drama will play out. The HBO series is faithful to Martin's vision, a testament to the quality of the writing. Beyond the many characters, it is a true page-turner. The cliff-hanger ending leaves one with the irresistible desire to read on and find out what happens to some of the younger characters. The second novel is \"A Clash of Kings\" and I'm eager to find out what happens to Sansa and Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Princess Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister (the \"Imp\"), and so many more. I'm hooked!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fantastic\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I've read almost two books of the set so far and every one of them is absolutely brilliant. You can call it fantasy for grown ups, where gruesome reality of war and complexity of human nature is tightly interwoven with events highly reminiscent of ones in actual French and English history, interspersed with magic and lore. It's not some low-brow fantasy cliche adventure with corny heroes and fair maidens with giant knockers (no offense to low-brow fantasy, you have your time and place in the absence of better writing) -this is a real work of art that is done intelligently, with great love and compassion for human condition and descriptions that will either make you absolutely entranced with their beauty, or force you to shudder at their brutal honesty. He's got the best style of writing I've seen in decades, I'm finishing the second book now (A Clash of Kings) and I cannot put it down till wee hours of the morning. I can't think of anyone who has a better, richer, more gripping writing style than G.R.R. Martin these days, and can't believe that I didn't pick these books up until now. I have not seen the show yet  besides getting a few glimpses here and there, but judging by how fast they are forced to move through events to fit into the series' timeframe, I see that they are glazing over huge chunks of the backstory which is not only important further in the books, but also contains all the intrigue, mystery, character development and interactions you don't want to miss, so I really recommend reading the books even if you already follow the series-there is so much more that would never fit into any possible screen format. Magnificent books, stunningly good writing, so happy to discover them.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    You Either Win, Or You Die\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Never has a more fundamentally correct statement been made of a series of books. This, the first book in the so far five book series, is mostly context. You learn about the world that is about to get thrown into chaos (and when I say chaos, I mean total, unadulterated, s*** storm chaos). You learn about everything and everyone that your soon to be beloved protagonists/antagonists (because you'll love them both) have loved and lost, and you'll feel genuine pain when they do. No book or series of books has been able to elicit such emotions from I, because I am a emotionless demon, black of heart.But Game of Thrones does what nothing else in this world can do. Make me \"feel\" things.I initially started watching the TV series back in season 1. At the end of episode six, I felt as if my mind had been not only raped, but pleasantly raped at that. Do you understand? No. Neither did I. But I couldn't help but want more, and so I turned to these books. By the time episode seven aired on TV, I had finished the book. I knew exactly what was coming, exactly who was to live and who was to die, but it didn't matter. I was still invested in every way. I read through the other three books in a matter of weeks, and then had to wait two or three months for book five to be published--the longest wait through which I have ever suffered.But it was worth it. If you haven't started A Game of Thrones, if you haven't watched the show or read the books, then start now. Buy this. It's amazeballs.A word of warning: If this review was unsuitable for your children, then this book will be even worse for them. Best of luck.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Don't believe the hype?  Read, and you will!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    There are so many reviews that maybe one more is silly, but I just had to add my two cents.  I think these are about the best books I have ever read.  Very few authors even come close.  Please see my review of the third book (spoiler free, I promise).I have seen that many of the critics are saying that there is too much sex and violence.  I don't think the sex is overly done at all.  In real life, real politics (and this book is very much about politics), real relationships, sex is a factor.  That is just realistic.  It is also true that there is a lot of violence - we are talking about war.  And while some of the scenes will turn your stomach, that's the point.  War is horrible - and the point is that the innocent bystanders often suffer the most.  So is it too much?  Well, it's definitely too much for adolescents in my opinion.  As for adults, it depends on what you're looking for I guess.  These books will leave you lying awake at night (assuming you were able to put them down and go to bed in the first place) contemplating the horror of it all.  But you will also lie awake wondering what is going to happen next.  You'll look ahead to see how many pages until you get to your favorite POV again.  You'll change your mind about who is good and who is bad.Critics are also saying there are too many characters.  And I can't really argue that - there are a lot of minor characters.  But again, I think it's just realistic.  This is a story about kingdoms and families.  Of course there are lots of people.  Read history - you'll find lots of people.  That's sortof the nature of humanity!  If there were only a few characters, the plot would not be nearly so intricate or intriguing.And while some are saying that all the rave is simply because we don't want to bash something that others love, I would say the opposite.  I'm willing to bet that some of the critics are calling it trash just to be different.  So the only thing I can say is, read it and decide for yourself.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Violence, Violence , and More Violence\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Time/Setting:  Similar in dress, weapons, habitat and speech to the Medieval Period or some earlier mythical periodCharacters:  Unbelievably believable.  The noble families of the seven kingdoms commit all sorts of atrocious crimes to become the King of the Realm (ruler of all the kingdoms).  As disgusting as their actions were, I empathized with those who wanted to do the right thing but didn’t, admired those who had the strength to choose honor over glory, and hated those who plotted and murdered their way to the top.Plot: Killing or I should say slaughter and rape by the nobles and warriors were as common as swatting flies.  Men, women, children and babies were callously butchered along the road to power.  Slavery, incest, betrayal, the supernatural and dragons permeated the storyline.Themes:  “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.” ( Game of Thrones)  Fairness and honesty were not a part of the rules.  Blood and broken promises were.Style:  Well written, incredibly imaginative, brilliant dialogue with realistic but strong, offensive language.  Each character, and there are many, alternately tells his/her own emotionally stirring story in  graphic detail that made me cringe and want to stop reading.  The stories intertwined to create a unified novel.Conclusion:  There wasn’t one.  It just ended with the last storyteller.  I must admit, it was probably one of the most beautiful passages in the entire book.  However, the cliff hanger approach for all the other characters left me feeling unfulfilled rather than looking forward to the sequel.  After reading 800+ pages of this epic fantasy of violence, violence and more violence, I realize that this is not my genre.  I’ll stick with Walt Disney.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    An Excellently Crafted World, With Compelling Characters\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is certainly one of the longest books I have ever read in my life, but the world that is crafted here takes a book this long to setup. George R.R. Martin has done a wonderful job of crafting a world of the seven kingdoms that highlights the political struggles and self motivations of seven ruling families. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre then there is a lot to like here, but take note that I would not actually consider this to be hard fantasy. While it does have knights and kings in it, there is no magic or fantastical beasts, at least not in any significant capacity. I have heard a lot of people compare this book and series to the Lord of the Rings. I think that comparison is apt only in relation to the scope of the world that this story takes place in, not in the way it is made.As is to be assumed with almost any book of this size the biggest drawback to it is the amount of information that is required by the reader. Very early on in the book you will find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of people you are expected to keep straight. On the whole though, once the characters are known the story itself progresses in a very forward fashion. The chapters are broken up nicely by the story progression of the individual characters and there were very few times that I ever felt that the story progression dragged on.Character development is very well done and I grew to love and hate characters in the book. What was great about most of the hated characters though is that none of them were truly evil. Everyone executed their actions due to various motivations which made not only their stories more interesting, but more human.Overall this is incredibly well crafted with one of the most interesting worlds I have read in fantasy in quite a long time. Don't be frightened by the length.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Highly recommended book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I highly recommend the book game of thrones a song of ice and Fire. because it tells the story of a battle for the throne, it's complex nature and multiple plot lines has turned it into one of my favorite books. This is also because Game of Thrones is based off of a real event in the United Kingdom called the battles of the Roses. Visit Ted-Ed to learn more about these battles. Game of thrones a song of ice and fire is the first book of the series written by  George R. R. Martin.  The beginning of the Game of Thrones a song of Ice and Fire starts with a prologue foreshadowing a major problem in the future, white walkers. They are mystic  beings north of the border of Westerose and wilding territory, this border is called the wall, and is quite literally a 750 foot tall wall of ice. But the actual plot starts with Eddard Stark, also known as Ned, his children Rob, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Jon Snow, Ned’s bastard son. Ned Stark is considered the most honorable man in the seven kingdoms, as well as the free cities. Both of these continents make up Westerose, the land which the man in the iron throne rules. Ned Stark is a the lord of Winterfell and head of the Stark family. This is only one of the many plot lines, every chapter starts at a different person's point of view with no apparent main character. These characters are often killed or no longer have a story arc showing no one is safe, this is one of the reason Game of Thrones is my favorite series as well as the books, it is unpredictable. No one is safe and the books are constantly introducing new concepts and characters.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Shame on me for reading the whole thing\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Before I launch into the reasons I will not be reading the rest of the series, let me say that I believe George R.R. Martin to be a masterful storyteller. This is the only book of his that I have read as yet, however.  Martin weaves a tale so gripping you feel that you are a character in the story. And he fashions characters as real as any person you actually know. The twists and turns hook you and keep you wanting more.Unfortunately, I will not be reading on to find out what becomes of the characters I have grown to admire, despise or pity.  I cannot stomach one more description of the rape, degredation or denigration of the female characters in Martin's writing. The word \"whore\" is used too many times to count. Yes, yes, we get it: the men in this world saw lowborn women as nothing more than servants or sluts to satisfy their needs. Only women who are lucky enough to marry into the right family are treated with any kind of respect- respect that vanishes instantly with the precarious positions of power their husbands hold. Martin, however, beats the point to death.Even more disturbing is the graphic description of women being raped/sodomized or gang-raped several times in the story. One mention (in less detail)of this vile practice among the Dothraki people would have sufficed, but I guess the author felt it necessary to creep us out with many more. And the description of the seduction of a 13 year-old Daenerys, by a grown man, left me feeling dirty and guilty for reading on. Yes, they married young in this world, we get it.As if that was not bad enough, of the main female characters, there is only one that I could admire: Arya, the nine year-old daughter of Eddard Stark.  She is the only character who was intelligent as well as strong and independent minded. Alas, Martin seems to imply that beauty is incompatible with brains and virtue by describing her as \"horse-faced\" by other characters. The others may have beauty, but lack virtue or are foolish and weak, because of their womanly passions. Cersei Lannister, the queen, is lovely but a cold-blooded, cunning witch. Sansa, the twelve year old daughter of Eddard Stark, is pretty, sickenly well-bred, but lacking in sense and loyalty.  Daenerys is abused and brainwashed in turn by her brother, then Dothraki culture. Catelyn Stark, Eddard's wife, also beautiful but tragically selfish to her family's ruin. Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister, is portrayed as half-mad and revoltingly doting over her sickly son. Women servants and common peasants are repeatedly, and so contemptuously described that it makes you want to scream, \"Yeah, we got that a long time ago: women are sluts and only fit to do a man's bidding. can we move on already!?\"This is in contrast to the male characters who also have flaws, but are basically excused by their life experiences and particular upbringing. We can find many males to empathize with and/or admire: the honorable, but too trusting Eddard Stark; his resolute and skilled bastard son, Jon Snow; young Robb Stark, brave and thoughtful; the staunch and loyal men in the Tully family and other families pledged to the Starks; the loyal and valiant knights and men of the Kingsguard; even Khal Drogo of the bloodthirsty Dothrakis and the scheming Imp, Tyrion Lannister.I hope to find another author in this genre, or even another book by Martin that does not offend the whole female gender the way this book did.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"12"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Don't get too attached to anyone!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is truly one of the most gripping reads I've ever experienced.  When it comes to the fantasy genre, I can take it or leave it.  But I'd heard so much about this series that I finally had to give it a shot -- and believe me, it DOES live up to every bit of the hype.  835 pages flew by in just a few days.  This is the kind of book you forgo sleep to keep reading.The book's primary strengths are Martin's characters.  He is such a great writer that he can make you care about a character within just a few pages.  This book presents us with Ned Stark, a Lord who frequently places honor above wisdom, and most of the chapters are written from the POV of his wife and four of his children.  Through their eyes, we are introduced to an entire continent teeming with a rich history that binds the major players together in ways we only begin to comprehend.Martin does not hold his characters so sacred that they are protected from harm.  The people we start to care about the most are injured, captured and killed without ceremony or fanfare.  Even the prologue is a \"Psycho\"-esque feint.  Just as the story lulls you into that enjoyable complacency that comes of watching people have an adventure, Martin jars you back to \"reality\" with yet another twist that you did not see coming.  That, along with all the rape, cursing, extreme violence and extreme even more rape sets this far apart from any ordinary fantasy series.The map at the beginning and the appendix of characters at the end are indispensable to help orient you in Martin's world.  And once you're in it, you can't bear to leave it.  When the book ends, all you want to do is find out what happens next.

There's mostly good news: it turns out that HBO was almost eerily faithful to the plot of the books (at least judging from this first novel). You can easily picture the scenes from the TV show playing out in your head in tandem with the words on the page. The only real difference is the ages of the characters...but then again, it would be hard to create a palatable TV show featuring sex scenes between teen girls and grown men (for instance, in the book Dany is 14 on her wedding night).The only (debatable) drawback: If you've seen the TV series, you'll find that the novel offers very little additional information/detail. But is that a criticism of the book, or praise for the show? I'm conflicted. While I would like to have been privy to brand new revelations and additional character motivation etc., I'm simultaneously impressed at how faithfully and thoroughly HBO has transferred the mythology and history of this complex literary world to a media format that traditionally requires ditching all but the most vital elements of character and plot.The bottom line: if you love the show, you'll enjoy revisiting the lives of your favorite characters. The plotting is fast-paced and satisfying. Martin is an excellent writer, and he created a truly compelling page-turner that never drags or disappoints. I'm looking forward to book two.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"13"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Good but Cluttered Fantasy Novel\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Characters: B+ Some really great ones. My favorites are Tyrion Lannister, Robert Baratheon, Sansa Stark, and Sandor Clegane.For all the wonderful characters, the story is diluted by a lot of really bland ones. I found it very easy to confuse the many different incarnations of \"Trusty old knight in his 50s.\" Ser Rodrik, Ser Barristan, Ser Mormont, Ser Brynden Tully, Ser Vardis Egan... they were the same to me. (I mentally used Sir Tuxford from the /Gummi Bears/ cartoon for all of these guys: [...] )I like that everybody has good and bad points. I like that women have useful roles and credible character developments. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters on the Eastern (Dothraki) continent storyline. They seemed written halfheartedly.I had to take notes on everybody to keep the characters straight. It felt like there would be a final exam or something. Not fun, and it took me out of the book.World: B. The farther south we go, the less I care. The Wall and the Others seems NEAT and very imaginative. The idea that each major castle is powerfully fortified in a very different way was cool (high on a mountain, twin castles straddling a river, between three rivers, biosphere food supply, etc.) Once we get to King's Landing I feel as though this is very familiar fantasy territory. And the Eastern Dothraki stuff just felt...yawn.Mood: A. Home run here. I love the grittiness. I love how Tyrion embodies the realpolitik grittiness and Sansa demonstrates the perils of a sanitized/idealistic worldview. I think that's why those two are my favorite characters so far.Mechanics: C+. The long seasons are a cool idea, but how would castles other than Winterfell with its greenhouses have enough food during winter? The longer-than-Earth years are also a nice touch. But I hate the grade inflation with all the knights. Every knight is a great swordsman. 60 year old knights kick ass. 30 year old horse lords kick ass. 16 year old flower knights kick ass. They're ALL SO TALENTED. C'mon. There hasn't been a real war in a decade, so some of these guys surely have sinecures and are hoping nobody will call them on it. I reject the idea that a corrupt and dissolute kingdom is 100% staffed by the feudal version of Navy SeAL knights.Also, there is no way any of the Southron kingdoms would continue to pay military taxes to the Night's Watch when there is no apparent threat from the north. They Soviet Union had nuclear missiles, which are way scarier than zombies, and just 15 years after it collapsed most European nations started witholding NATO dues. The Others haven't been seen in 8,000 Westeros years, which is like what, 10,000 Earth years? Nope.Plot: Incomplete. 800 pages is just nuts, and almost nothing gets resolved. /The Godfather/ was 500 pages. /Dune/ was 500 pages. And yeah they both had sequels, but in both of those novels there was clear progress and a satisfactory ending. I use those two novels because all three of these books have a lot of characters, a lot of morally grey areas, and a lot of scheming and murder as dynasties grow and change.Style: B-. Functional. He's no Tolkien or Rowling, but he's not a hack, either. The mystery murder subplot is well done. Tyrion has some great gallows humor. Catelyn narrates her marriage honestly and clearly. The writing didn't dazzle me, but neither did it make me cringe.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"13"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Good Game\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Ever since Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings was published, the epic high fantasy trilogy has been virtually unbeatable as far as sales within the inappropriately combined Fantasy and Science Fiction genre. Nearly fifty years after Tolkien, the fantasy trilogy has grown into a loutish beast, producing massive never-ending fantastical soap operas that mix sex, magic, and monsters, with a dollop of that special ingredient that makes them unavoidable to adolescent boys and adults willing to relive there youth at the sacrifice of good solid writing. Now, with the \"Rings\" as blockbuster movies, and J.K. Rowling as the richest women in Britain, we get a sense that these - never quite 'out' - compendiums are coming back. George R. R. Martin begins his projected six book 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series with the eight hundred page A Game of Thrones. And while this outing doesn't have all the sub-textual brilliance of Tolkien, and does have all those little teenager asides, it stands amongst its peers as a giant. Always captivating, and always verging on breathtaking suspense, 'Game' is more a massive family drama than anything else.The Starks of Winterfell guard the lands to the North. And up in the North, strange things are sneaking down. Meanwhile, the King and his despicable wife are having troubles. Thus the table is set for a feud over rule - a game of thrones - that encompasses several generations of seven massive families and hundreds of extra characters. The only thing more magnificent than the scope is the deft way in which Martin is able to make sense of it all. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a particular character; a device that works excellently  in describing multiple points of view as well as in doling out suspense. One chapter may end in a sort of mini-cliffhanger that isn't then resolved until that character's next chapter comes up in the batting lineup. The writing is superb with the only exception being a somewhat late-night sex romp description of everything 'between the sheets' and the often cacophonous anachronisms used to give the characters a period feel. However, once involved in the story, with all those psuedo lit books that are storming the market fresh out of one's mind, there is no doubt that one will enjoy this book, and want to continue with the others.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"13"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The books make the show look cheesy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Game of thrones was one of my favorite shows on TV.

There are certain things (I won't spoil anything) that didn't come across in the show the way they do in the books, that changed the way I saw the characters and their actions and motives. Characters that I hated I now pity. Characters that I liked have a heavy new depth to them.

I'll binge watch the show after I finish the other four (I'm not counting the prequels).So, the first episode I saw on television follows the beginning of this book very well.

I read only about half of LOTR (even though I love the movies and own the extended editions) because I couldn't get into the long prose and mystical happenings with creatures great and small.I must say that A Game of Thrones blew me away. It sounded really interesting and I never even heard of it before the HBO series (I decided to read it before watching it, and I'm glad I did). The characters and the land of Westeros is brilliantly detailed and developed. I felt like I was there and I could vividly see the details of the various castles and countryside.If you are interested in epic storytelling and a taste of \"historical fiction\" with some light fantasy elements then this is a must read. There is a bit of weird, mystical, fantasy elements in it (and the last chapter was ..... WOW.... but overall it isn't overpowering or too out there to enjoy (if you don't normally like that kind of thing).I was originally intimidated by the 800 page length, but I must say once I got engrossed in the story I raced through it.NOTE ON THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK: I bought the mass market paperback edition and at 800 pages they made the print so small that it is really hard to read (I'm only 31 and JUST got reading glasses for the first time but it was still hard to read). I didn't have any pages fall apart but then I am careful with large paperbacks to not bend/break the spine too much.

I became hooked!  After that, I began to read the original books and I just finished the first one (\"Game of Thrones\").  It is simply amazing!  Even recognizing that the HBO series is magnificently produced, the book is much better.  You will find many more details that are not included in the TV series and you will find that the author really worked in all characters up to a point that you can really see them in your mind's eye.  The characters are not only facades (as it occurs in other novels) but are so well thought that you can almost touch them.  In addition, the descriptions of landscapes and castles and armors and swords are so detailed that you can picture in your mind them.  Even though I am not a native English-speaker I really appreciated the beauty of many parts of the book.  Finally, I would like to say that the reading was even better because it is NOT so sexually explicit as the HBO series so, in what refers at least to the first book of the series, you can allow your teens (17 and older) to read it.  I highly recommend this book and I am sure I will do the same with the others.

Perhaps after the second in the series it would be the same, but after the third I could in honesty only have rated it a 3 or 4.  However, after the 4th in this series I can only conclude that Mr. Martin is both a gifted writer of fiction as well as an author whose work should be ignored.To begin with, while the author writes well, he must be paid by the word since these novels are absolutely interminable in length.  If you plan on being marooned for a few years on an island, or go to prison to do a nickel, just take this series with you.  You'll still not finish.  Second, the interesting alternating point of view between characters in the first three books metastasizes in the fourth with the addition of scores of new characters and their points of view while the points of view of other interesting characters developed in the first three suddenly disappear.  Cases in point - Tyrion, the dwarf brother of the evil Jaime, is one of the most interesting characters in the first three volumes, yet he inexplicably disappears in the fourth.  The second most interesting character in the volumes 1 - 3, Jon Snow, the bastard son of Eddard Stark, also makes no appearance in volume 4.  Same with the third most interesting character, Danerys.  Putting down volume 3, you really want to know what happens to her next.  Fuggetaboutit.  She's gone from volume 4.  Imagine the Lord of Rings, where each volume is 3 times longer and Frodo Baggins makes no appearance in the third volume.Additionally, Mr. Martin likes to kill off his most important characters, or render them suddenly blind, or convert them from being evil to nice.  Again, imagine Lord of the Rings, where Aragorn chokes to death on a mouthful of ale in the Two Towers, or Sauron turns out to be really a nice guy who's just irritated because a turkey buzzard flew into and got stuck in his big red eye.I guess my advice is to plow through these if you really don't mind being bitch slapped by an author.  The writing is excellent and the world created intriguing.  However, the story goes nowhere, and gets to nowhere via thousands of pages, all the while inserting and removing and altering characters at will.  I gather that many are waiting for the grand finale in volume 6 that Martin has promised.  If there is a God in heaven, we shall be spared.But if after this warning you still proceed on this irritating quest, do what I did.  When you finally figure out that you are being punked by the author, ignore the sequence of the chapters.  Just start with a character point of view and read each one for that character sequentially.  There is a bare semblance of a plot anyway, so Lord knows, you won't spoil anything by reading ahead for a particular character since nothing happens anyway.  When you get to volume 4, ignore all the randomly introduced new characters who add nothing to the story developed in the first three.  This way, you can impose some small amount of coherence on an otherwise completely incoherent story structure, and trust me, you won't lose anything in the process, mostly because there is nothing to lose in the first place.\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Book is in excellent shape\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I got the book after a few days, was packaged nicely and am enjoying the read!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    a fairly lazy review\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    - This is the first fantasy book I've read and I found the fantasy element to be a bit lacking. There are dragons and other fanciful creatures but not as much as I was expecting. So people wanting high fantasy may be disappointed.- This is the most engaging book I've read in the last few months. Although I didn't find it poorly written there are no delightfully written sentences, or delightfully read sentences I should say. I mean the story is great, the characters could be people you actually know, and the writing is neither wonderful nor distractingly bad.- I'm not gonna insult people who don't want to read depressing/gritty stories (I wouldn't say A Game of Thrones is depressing full stop, but some parts certainly are). Instead I will just echo what a lot of other reviews are saying: bad things happen to good people and people die in this book (if you're planning on doing the whole series your favorite character may die) and, what seems to be most damning for some people, bad things do not necessarily happen to bad people.- Every person I have met who has read this book has wanted to discuss it with me when they find out I've read it. Indeed this is a really good book to discuss with others because everyone has characters they love and hate and the bad characters aren't all bad and the good characters aren't all good and they are mostly well written. So people can discuss why such and such did that and why it was or wasn't x and how such and such was so y and that's really fun to do! Oh, and Sansa haters are jerks (see? it's fun!).- Regarding the Kindle edition: all of the issues I read about appeared to have been fixed now.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Surprise!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I didn't think I would like this book so much.  I don't usually go for the imaginary kingdom sort of story, and I don't like battle scenes, which I thought would constitute most of this book.  But so many people liked it, and it was on sale, so I took a chance.  I also was afraid that there would be so many characters that I wouldn't be able to keep them straight, but the author gave them each enough personality that I could remember them.  It probably also helped that I read more every day than I usually do even in my favorite authors' books.  I just always wanted to find out what would happen next.  The author writes good suspense with very good pacing, which might be because he is also a screenwriter (I believe...).  Another thing:  each chapter was from a different main character's point of view, and they were short enough and frequent enough that I would get right back into the character's mindset and enjoyed having a chance to catch up with what had been happening with that character a few chapters back.  Finally, I was reading from my Paperwhite, which has X-Ray, and a link to Shelfari to remind me if I did forget.  I have a 3G Paperwhite, so I could get the information even when I was away from home, or even out on the bleachers during halftime of a soccer match.Anyway, the characters are well developed, they're always doing interesting things to further their ambitions and handle their concerns, and there's even some spooky ghost-y stuff going on, just a little to get your heart pounding even more.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Literature?  No.  Fun Read?  Generally, Yes.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    With the production of the much-anticipated HBO series, \"A Game of Thrones\" is a novel that is definitely coming into its own.  Whether that is a \"good\" or \"bad\" thing remains to be seen, and I have the impression that the series might just be better than the book.I am not going to rehash the plot or characters.  Over 1,000 reviews cover that territory and well.  Suffice it to say, Martin does little original work here.  The characters are familiar archetypes through and through, the dialogue is often tinny and predictable, and he has a very irritating tendency to repeat words and phrases needlessly.  If I read \"milk of the poppy\" or \"Knight of Flowers\" once, I read it a thousand times.  And his proliferation of lords and ladies both great and petty with endless descriptions of their heraldry makes one wonder if anyone besides nobility lives in Westeros.  Further, the most casual glance at any good history book will quickly reveal where he found much of his inspiration.  The Dothraki are Central Asian nomads, the Lannisters the rough equivalent of the Borgias, the Greyjoys the Vikings, just to name three.So, if all of this criticism is accurate, why three stars?  Simple.  \"A Game of Thrones\" is a fun read, overall.  It has enough regal plotting and counter-plotting to satisfy any armchair Machiavelli, enough action to engage interest, and - let's face it - who doesn't enjoy a good melodrama from time to time, just an old fashioned yarn to pass the hours?  And a couple of the characters with literary roots like Tyrion Lannister (Poe's \"Hopfrog\") and Jon Snow (a kind of sword-swinging \"Pip\" from \"Great Expectations\") do have moments where they rise above the writing to assume a kind of memorability.  Further, those scenes with the \"Black Brothers\" of the Night Watch manning their \"Wall\" against an evil menace from the north are quite well done and stand out well in sharp contrast to the cavalcade of jaw dropping political sometime-idiots populating more habitable climes in this fantasy world.I do have to applaud one thing, though.  Martin is faithful to an accurate Middle Ages morality where \"true knights\" were an idyll, the reality usually something far more earthy and far more ugly and brutal.  He also does not allow any of his characters to be \"Galahad,\" at least not without many moral failings along the way and conflicts of conscience which come off as entirely credible.  And this is refreshing indeed.  If anything makes a \"A Game of Thrones\" stand out from its genre, it is the author's absolute refusal to indulge \"happily ever afters,\" \"good beats evil every time\" or cheesy \"Deus ex Machina\" tricks.  And to that, I say - \"Well done.\"  Mediaeval life for highborn and lowborn, even wrenched into a fantasy genre, was a generally nasty affair, and Martin sees and writes it as it generally was without so much as a flinch.If you are a fan of what many would call \"serious\" fantasy, like Tolkien or Howard, you might want to check \"A Game of Thrones\" out of the library to see if it whets your appetite.  But if you are looking for an enjoyable read to while away some time and forget your cares, play the \"game.\"  I have and come away no worse for the experience.A fun book, recommended.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \"We all do our duty when there is no cost to it.\"\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    So I finally caved and read “A Game of Thrones”, despite the fact that I insist that I am not a fantasy guy. I will admit it. I really enjoyed this book. It kept my attention and I found myself wanting to go back and read it!It is a big book, many people, have said many things about it. Here are some of mine:• The characterization is really good. There are defined personalities and traits and Mr. Martin usually conveys them without a superfluous amount of words.• The alternating points of view chapter by chapter. This device allows the reader to take in the massive scope of the story that is being told here in manageable chunks. I hope this style continues thru the series.• The large arc of the story. Mr. Martin has created world here, with a complete and rich history.• The novel is unapologetic. By that, I mean there is rampant sexism, violence, etc. Not pretty elements, but the author is not casting a modern eye on them apologizing for every undesirable trait. This is an ancient world, not like our own. He allows that story to happen without foisting modern sensibilities on it. I appreciate someone just telling a story and letting the actions speak for themselves. You are disgusted or titillated by what the characters are doing based on how you view the world.That is a quick overview, but some of the highlights. I will say, the overlong descriptions of clothing and food I could do with a little less of, but it is a small quibble, and I have friends who love that aspect of the book, so there ya go.I will be continuing this journey through the Seven Kingdoms, but I am not sure when.

MartinGenre: Action/Adventure  FictionalThis book was absolutely phenomenal. While reading this book I did not know what would happen next. There are so many twists and turns that the author puts into it. It was impossible to lose focus while reading. This book is about many characters set in an age of knights and chivalry. This book takes you on in adventure in their fictional world with new cultures and fantasies. The main idea of the book is to find out and connect the pieces to see who will end up sitting in the royal throne; hense the title. The characters always are growing and changing the way you view and connect with them. The series on tv is incredible but the book makes you feel like you are actually in their world. Personally it is hard for me to stay entertained in a book but unlike any others, game of thrones let my imagination go into the words. The author was able to put so much imagery into the text yet able to keep things in enough order so I was able to follow each step. I highly recommend this book to anyone highschool and up. Do not just watch the shows but also follow them with these books because they will give you so much background information and give you a whole new viewpoint on the land and characters. Once again, this book was absolutely incredible and I cannot wait until I get the pleasure of reading the next!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Good, but slow-starting\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I suppose it's not unusual for fantasy books to be long or slow-starting, but A Game of Thrones felt longer and slow-starting-er than most. Once it gets going, it turns into a gripping tale of kingly bloodlines, monsters from the woods, and royals in exile.Surprisingly, the political intrigue takes center stage, departing from the genre's usual focus on magic spells and epic battle sequences. The thoughts and motivations of the characters call to mind the moral conflicts of Orson Scott Card's work, and make for a far more interesting read than the usual mage-fighting-a-dragon. Yet it's not without its action sequences. Or its brutality. Early on, one character -- a young child -- is paralyzed from a high fall. Other characters are raped, beheaded, or similarly made uncomfortable. Several wolf puppies are also killed, which is somehow even more awful. The novel features more than its fair share of sex, giving it a grittier feel than its peers.A Game of Thrones is sometimes its own worst enemy. The sheer volume of characters puts biblical genealogies to shame. If by the end of the first reading you've got a good feel for half of the major and minor players, consider yourself lucky. So many lords and squires and young ranger boys traipse through the pages, it takes a few paragraphs to figure out which names are the good guys, the bad guys, the wolf pups, and the cities.Like all Book One's of a fantasy series, this one ends just when you've decided you'd like to know the answers to some of the questions. I presume Book 2 (and 3 and 4) will start to resolve this Game. But I have to say, it made me want to keep reading, so I think it's done its job.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Exciting and a page-turner!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    “The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray.  Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat.  They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.”Last summer a Goodreads friend of mine was reading this book and he made me laugh with his comments about how George R. R. Martin was keeping him up at night because he couldn’t put the book down.  I decided to dedicate much of my summer reading to science and science fiction, so I’ve finally gotten around to reading this book.Game of Thrones is definitely exciting and a page turner.  Martin deftly captures the reader and draws him into a world of kings, would-be-rulers, and divided loyalties.  As a lover of historical fiction, I can certainly understand how this type of fantasy can appeal to that crowd.  Set in a world much like our own middle ages, the intrigue and political games mirror much of real history.  But in this novel, because it’s fantasy, we have some sorcery, and some strange, once-human, murdering creatures beyond “the wall”, in the northern part of this fabricated kingdom.I was almost finished with the book, when I remembered hearing that this series isn’t typical – in A Song of Ice and Fire (the series name) good does not necessarily win over evil.  Yes, Martin does throw in several twists where the hero takes a fall, but I’m still holding out for the good guy to win in the end.  I’m also looking forward to reading the rest of the books and watching the HBO series!\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Does not stand alone as a novel\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series has taken on the status of `Must Read' with the constant critical acclaim, the HBO series, and prime real estate positioning of his books at the local brick and mortar. I succumbed to the marketing pressures and decided to check out what all the fuss was about, so I purchased a copy of \"A Game of Thrones\" the first book in the series.\"A Game of Thrones\" is founded on a solid base with a medieval type kingdom in turmoil, and all the big players in royal politics end up duking it out when the ascension of the prince to the throne is questioned. As far as fantastic elements, this book does not go over the top, but rather has it layered in nicely with magic not being front in center, but hiding underground with only a couple people with access to it. This makes the book accessible to those who are usually turned off by the elves, dwarfs, and wizards in traditional high fantasy. Martin also paints a very complex and vivid world that includes seasons (like winter or summer) that can last for decades on end as well as tribes of horse-riding warlords with a rich culture.It is also clear that Martin is a master of weaving a complex plot that twists and turns through the lives of a vast array of characters that range in age from about ten to fifty, male and female, and gives the point of view of all sides of the conflict. Further more, each character is well developed to the point where they all have traits that both make them strong and weak at the same time. It's refreshing to see somebody in the fantasy take the time to so diligently flesh out his characters.However, there are too many characters and far too many character viewpoints to really get the reader fully invested in the book. By page 50 of the first book, I had read eight different points of view from different characters scattered across the world without once having the same viewpoint twice. This made it very difficult to get invested in the book when I wasn't sure who the main character was, even though it turns out this book has about eight main characters.And this leads to another problem. With eight points of view and 704 pages, we only get on average 88 pagers per main character. This book was essentially the first quarter of eight separate novels. For most novels, it usually takes about 75 to 100 pages for the first major plot point to hit and the story begins, and each of these separate story lines is no exception. This makes the book then lack much of a (or any) story arc for many of the characters as the journey has just really begun.As a result, most of the characters undergo little or no change, and the plot really becomes almost like a listening to a history lecture (This book is said to be loosely based on the War of the Roses.) from an eloquent professor. It has it's entertaining moments and there are a couple times when I found myself wanting to read another couple pages before I went to sleep because the story drew me in, but for the most part I kept going only because I wanted to get to the point where the story became good enough for an HBO series, but that never came.Perhaps in book 2 or 3 or 4 it gets good, but I will probably not read those. While each of the 8 separate stories started out fine, that's about all they managed to do. Martin just proved to me he knows how to open a novel 8 times and not that he can finish one. I for one and not about to read another 2600 pages to find out if his epic is going anywhere, and I do not recommend you invest your time in this book.\"The Game of Thrones\" receives 2 out of 5 stars.\\n  \\n","3":"2.0 out of 5 stars","4":"14"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I feel like I should be giving it a 1/5\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Unlike a lot of the people who have enjoyed this series, I cannot. This first book opens with eight different POV's and as the series continues the number of POV's increase (dragon's has 18 POV). Of these 8 PoV's, I cared for 3. To be honest, after the first 100 pages, I just started skipping the people I couldn't give a crap about and read Jon's, Ayra's and Ned's stories through to completion before even bothering with the rest.I will say that I did finish this book, even though a good 60% of it bored the heck out of me. Martin's writing is engaging when you care about the character. This would be a good thing but I didn't really care about the majority of them anyways. Most of the characters that I disliked have many annoying qualities of different stereotypes all rolled into one character that just made me hate them. Sasha for one: raised by the Starks so you would think she would have a decent outlook on life. Nope, she is just a royal prat. Along with this she is that annoying horrible sister, the annoying I'm-so-in-love-with-a-guy-who-doesn't-like-me-but-I'm-too-daft-to-figure-that-out and the teenage girl persona we all like to see get killed in horror films. I have no idea where Martin was going with her but I just can't care about someone who is just so annoying I don't even want to read about her. And he does this with a bunch of characters!Now if each of these characters had a little more time as a lead on paper, maybe it wouldnt have been so bad and I would have grown to like them(Sasha) but with 8 characters and only 864 pages to fit them into (about 108 pages per character) none of them get the time to shine.Now for Martin's treatment of the girl across the sea, that is just wrong, discusting and I had a hard time reading it. thankfully it was brief and it is one of the reasons I won't read another one of these books. Insest, Pedophilia... really? Fine, add it into the book but you know what, I really don't want to have to witness it. Say it happened? thats okay. Make me read it as it happens, not fine. Its not hot its just discusting.The reason I did give the book 3 stars was Jon's story and Ned's story. The only two really worth reading. Personally, if he had written two series, one FOCUSING only on Jon and one only on Ned, now those would have been worth the read. Jon's story really doesn't even involve the rest of the world or even need to. so why is it even there?Ned's story was also awesome. political? yep but if he had continued it, it could have been even better than the A Song of Ice and Fire.So overall:You like Multiple POV's?You like unnecessary deaths?You Like struggles with no gain?You like explicit sex *cough* rape *cough* scenes?Then this series is for you.If not, don't read it. It starts off where Jordan and Goodkind got to with their 5th books. Too many characters to actually care about to read the book.The writing is good though (hence the extra stars)\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Maybe my favorite books of all time\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I recommend the whole series \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\"  This book is just the first in the series.

I have to warn people, however, that you may need a support group while reading.  Things happen that shock you--many times I yelled out loud to no one because I was so astounded.  You will continue to need the support group when you are finished because these books become so much a part of your life that, when you finish, you feel lost, bewildered, and wonder what you are going to do without them.  Where is Tyrion?  the mother of dragons?  what is going to become of everything?...I read the books before HBO did their series so anyone reading will already know some things about the books.  I have re-read and they are still fab second time around.  I think HBO is doing a pretty good job but they have changed some things that irritate the heck out of me.  Please pay attention to Khal Drogo and Daenery's honeymoon.  In the book he is gentle, loving, tender in the foreplay that consummates their marriage.  HBO made it a grab her and do it from behind in a violent way.  THAT did not happen and I don't know who got off making that change.Please let George RR Martin finish the series!!!

The plot is interwoven between the many characters, and it very legnthy and intricate, and this series is not for those who require immediate gratification to say the least. The complexity and multiple story lines makes for a very long narative, so be warned. In my opinion, I love lenthy, complex stories with many characters and story lines. I actually seek them out, and I love every aspect of these books every time I've read them. For me, the characters are very real individuals. I found myself disliking some of the characters as bad/evil in the begining, but their circumstances and histories changed my mind later. I found Martn wrote chldren and woman convincingly, and a female reader I am often disappointed by sterotypical, two dimensional female characters and whiny, stupid children. I also found the castle life depicted to be gritty and realistic instead of flower and graceful as it is often depicted in fantasy books. And, this book is not flowery or kind in anyway. The characters are tormented and mistreated by each other and themselves. The world is facinating and unlik anything I'e seen. The seasons take years. When winter comes, its long and brutal. The frozen north is inhabited by an evil lost to legend, and the winter is coming. boarder defenses at the border are deminished, and no one believes there is a threat.

You get hit with a lot of characters and place names in the first book.  But each character is individually unique.It is almost overwhelming to keep the myriad characters and families separate and in proper time and space.  But, take heart, after the first 1200 pages, the story settles into order in your mind.  You begin to understand and follow the struggle as it unfolds.Other than the main families, you never do fully understand the different factions involved.  Thankfully, a handy appendix at the end of each book helps answer your questions.Once you get through the awkwardness of a new character's viewpoint with every chapter (which I don't recommend as a writing style) by the second book you have a strong understanding of the author's world and the story pulls you in to it's epic proportions.  You find yourself hooked and eager to read what problem your favorite character(s)are facing.Near the end of the second book you begin to see the author's model of the \"seven\".  Each must play a part.You will find yourself tempted to skim a particular character's chapter.  We each have our favorites.  However, it is best to take the time to read each chapter thoroughly as the story and it's characters unfolds with bits and pieces in each chapter into an epic whole.It is a somber book.  There are rarely moments of light levity.  There is sexual frankness.  The violence is graphically described.  It will affect your mood.But, there is a magnetic appeal to the series.  Be prepared to feel yourself drawn to the books.  Your demeanor will be a bit heavy and thoughtful after each reading. You will find yourself thinking about the series when it is not at hand.  The books haunt you.Enjoy, but be prepared to be shocked, hooked, and consumed by Martin's series.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A superb fantasy. But adults only.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A multi-faceted fantasy can mean different things for different people. But for me, this story inspires because it tells the story of underdogs, a bastard, a princess sold like a common slave by her cruel maniacal brother and a dwarf who must endure redicule and prejudice for his whole life. Despite cruel hand of fate had dealt them disadvantages, they forged ahead by their wit, wisdom, honor, but most of all, goodness in their souls. Unlike other fantasies, Games of Thrones is unique and ompletely believable because the characters emobdied human traits we so easily indentify with. They craved love, ambition, power, sex and would stoop to treachery to get them if necessary. For the brave and the honourable like Eddard Stark and his family, even Tyrion, compassion is foremost. So many interesting characters and rivalries between seven kingdoms and their fascinating histories. All these rivalries and treacheries confined in an elongated fantasy land sandwiched by the mysterious wall in the north and the fiery dragons in the east. A marvelous tale which I am sure the likes of Charles Dickens would marvel at if he got to read it. Like millions of GOT fans, I take my hat off to GRRM. His scope of imagination, eloquence, wit and humor cannot be praised enough. I love your stories. My favorite characters were Dany, John, Arya, Tywin and the wolves. But most of all, I love Tyrion. An important lesson for us all is that despite receiving the short end of the stick from birth, one can still charm others with one's wit, intelligence and good heartedness.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    WILL make you want more\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If there is only one sentence (well 2 including this one) that you read of this review, make it this one.Start this series immediately.Now, onto the detail.  I am a recovering non-fiction reader who would scoff at reading fiction in my teens and early twenties.  For some reason I could never get into it outside of hard sci-fi (which had at least some connection to base scientific principles).  I started reading Neal Stephenson and George RR Martin, and I have been blown away.  Game of Thrones, and its successors, are about the most intriguing stories I have ever experienced.  The characters are REAL, and the plots are intricate.  The minute you think you have found your hero of the story...poof...they are gone.  This may seem wrong in some way, but believe me, Martin will have you switching sides and supporting rival characters all the way through the epic.  From handsome knights to beautiful queens, and all the way to ugly dwarfs...and that is in the same family.  THe cunning wits of the characters are dynamic.  Don't underestimate ANYONE in this story.  If you read Game of Thrones, you WILL read the others.  Currently I am 1/4 way into the third book, A Storm of Swords, and I find myself reading internet forums looking for people's opinions of other authors I can read that even compare to Martin.  I am afraid when the series is over, the world will be void of a story of this caliber.  But I think I have found something in Bakker and Erikson...we will see.  Buy this now....you can go ahead and buy the rest as well.One more note, the switching around of story lines and characters will have things bouncing areound quite a bit, and it may be confusing for a while.  Believe me, by the middle of Clash of Kings, you will know where you are in Westeros, and you will be well grounded in the characters.  PRAISE TO MARTIN.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Read this book.

I love non fiction and stay clear of fantasy and this book, this series, seemed just too long.  And, it is often a hassel to keep track of lots of different characters with weird names. So I stayed away.  I just retired and thought, \"if not now, when?\" My book club came along for the ride. OMG! I love this book.  I have it on audio because I drive a lot and listen in the car. I also like to listen when I am straightening up the house.......but time after time, I had to sit down and pay attention to every word.  This is an amazing story written by a talented author.  At the close of Book 1, I had intended to immediately order Book 2.  My husband has been away and I am waiting to listen to Book 1 again with him this time.  I'd be shocked if we didn't do the entire series.  Not sure if I will watch the HBO series since many have said it does not follow the book.  And this book is just about perfect...why would I want to see another version?  Read this book.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    this tale will grow on you\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me just say that I read the first three books a year ago and have been anxiously awaiting the 4th in the series for some time now. So with this I am judging the first three at once. And I have to say that this is the best fantasy series that I have come across. I think that I have read over a hundred fantasy, not science fiction, books in my time and none of them compare in the over all sweep of imagination that Martin hands us here. Robert Jordan, Tolkein, et all... these authors could learn a thing or two from Martin.I just want to caution the prospective reader because these novels unfold gradually. Martin is not in a hurry to resolve the plot lines or take us from one action scene to the next as quickly as possible. Instead we become more and more acquainted with the main characters and when suspense calls, it is all the more terrifying for the interludes.Also I don't think that Martin knows how this series will end. I think that he might have had an idea and that it is evolving as he writes it. Which is great because instead of taking easy endings he is not only introducing new main characters into the story line but also drastically eliminating a few of those that have become too dear. So you just wont know what direction this series will turn next, and that is very refreshing. I think that this is a primary reason that these books succeed in becoming more engaging with every turned page.Pallisners 'Quincunx' though it is a historical novel and seen through the eyes of one character instead of a myriad of them would be the one book that I would recommend if you were looking for something similar to this series. I say this because the plot of 'Quincunx' is so incredibly complex (as is this series) it becomes a tour de force in many ways.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love the book...but annoyed with publisher for price!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am giving this book a full 5 stars, because George R.R. Martin deserves the credit for a well written and deftly woven book. I will not write a detailed review of his work; there is so much already written in the series of reviews here on Amazon. In summary, he writes an exciting story, and although it can get very complicated with the intrigue and (occasionally) confusing array of family names (some of them awefully similar at times), I love the series (and this is my second reading of it!).But I give RANDOM HOUSE DIGITAL (the listed seller) a 1 STAR for making Amazon charge the same price for the Kindle edition as for the paperback. Come on, that feels like gouging and profit taking at best. I bought the Kindle because I love the technology and the convenience. BUT, I also bought it because I feel it is a much better use of the earth's resources in general: less paper, no fuel to move around physical books, etc. AT THE SAME TIME, I expect the sellers to \"meet me part way\" and charge a REASONABLE price which fairly compensates the author and provides them profit, but reflects the fact that they did not have to print the book on paper and physically distribute it. Selling the Kindle edition for the same price as the paperback makes no sense to me. The seller - IMHO - is simply putting the savings in their pocket, rather than passing on at least SOME of those savings to the reader while retaining the original profit.I am VERY disappointed in Random House Digital (the seller) for this pricing strategy. I certainly hope they reconsider what they are charging for Kindle books (at least these) in the future.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The Game of Frowny Faces\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    While Martin has a knack for creating interesting characters, the Game of Thrones and the rest of the series aren't exactly what you might call action-packed. The problem with such an enormous cast of characters is that you're bound to find characters you love over characters you find boring, and it can be a long, long time before the narrative cycles around to whoever you're more interested in hearing about. As you might expect from its title, the series really is one massive fantasy conspiracy/political thriller, and at times the pages and pages of conversations detailing who is double-crossing whom or who is trying to suss who out as a traitor can really make your eyes glaze over.An alternate title might also be The Game Where Nothing Nice Ever Happens to Anyone (And If It Does, Something Worse Happens Immediately Afterwards). To put it bluntly, for a lot of the cast the series almost comes across as psychological torture porn, particularly in the case of the young female leads who are consistently degraded and abused, but really nobody is safe from having multiple, emotionally scarring tragedies befall them in every book. It winds up getting tedious, and you can't help but wonder what the point of it all is. Who cares if this person is rescued? She's only going to get raped and murdered later. Who cares if this person wins a duel? They'll probably be forced to watch their kingdom burn next chapter.Ultimately, this series requires a lot of commitment, and it wasn't one I was willing to give. After reading the first four books I had to call it quits. It didn't feel like the characters were getting anywhere, and the plot was moving like molasses in winter. While there were characters I enjoyed (and even loved a little), the whole thing is too plodding and gloomy to really feel like anything more than a chore, and I didn't feel like seeing what terrible thing was going to happen to Sansa next. As of book four, it didn't feel like any real headway had been made in the plot, unless the plot was \"the world is a terrible place, and no matter what you do, it will take a big dump on you at the moment you're happiest\". Make no mistake, if you enjoy meticulously detailed worlds and can keep up with its labyrinthine treacheries and ever-growing cast, the Song of Ice and Fire series is definitely worth a look. However, if you don't enjoy fantasy novels that leave you feeling depressed and cynical of the entire human race, you may want to download a sample or check this one out of the library before you shell out the cash.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"15"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Done with RR Martin\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I enjoyed the first few books but then it just meanders. The long passages about armor, colors and breasts gets old. His killing off characters as a form of plot twist becomes a trope and basically lazy writing. Some of his best ideas never get developed or expanded on. I was fine with him making some money off HBO and could let the fact they destroyed the story go if he actually finished what he started. However, after almost 30 years he cannot finish a 6-7 book series which is beyond annoying. So many other authors have written 20+ books in a series in that time. Authors just as creative and of same or better prose. If one more person refers to Martin in the same sentence as Tolkien I am going to loose it. Tolkien had a PHD and developed complete languages to flush out his world. The Silmarillion is brilliant. RR Martin is a massive disappointment.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Hoping For Some Happier Endings...But Overall A Good Book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am finishing Book Two of this series, and in looking back at Book One I can say that Martin set up the series well.  I am only giving four stars, though, because there were times as I read A Game of Thrones when I felt \"let down\" that certain good guys came out with the short end of the stick.  It was a little depressing that there was so much evil overcoming good.  This seemed to subside quite a bit in Book Two.One other aspect of the book that bothered me was that there are certain characters who at first seem good, then evil, then get depicted as good again, and then back to evil.  This continued in the second book of the series and I'm hoping that the characters become more solid in their intentions as I get ready to start Book Three.  But this vascillation DOES keep the reader guessing and gripped.Those two criticism aside, I really enjoyed this book.  Certain characters held my attention more than others, and I liked that Martin didn't \"drag\" any of the story lines.  The story \"moved\".  In A Game of Thrones, and continuing in Book Two, Arya's plot has been the most intriguing.  I am reading quickly to get to the chapters devoted to Arya.  Daenerys is my second favorite.  I am really pulling for these two characters as the series pushes forward.And for those who say this isn't \"Fantasy\".  You are wrong.  Unless, of course, your day-to-day life consists of the walking dead, dragons, etc.  Those things don't happen in my life, so I'm inclined to believe the Fantasy genre this book is labelled with.  Magic enters this series more markedly in Book Two, even if you don't get to see it much in this one, so stick with it.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    best series out there\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book (and entire series) get my wholehearted endorsement.  It is, by far, the best modern fantasy on the market.  Martin is a true master of his craft.  A few points that really sold me:Overall tone + characters: While technically a fantasy, this book actually has very little in it that is \"fantastic\", or magical.  That doesn't mean NO magic or supernatural beings (especially in the later books), but rather it means Martin prefers to rely on his characters and plot to captivate his audience, not cheap magic tricks you find in lesser works.  It is very Arthurian in tone, just MUCH more realistic and believable.  It has knights and tournaments, kings and ladies, and all the high chivalry you'd expect in an Arthurian tale, but it's just so much more real.  Very few characters are truly chivalrous.  And very few are truly evil.  The vast majority are somewhere in between; some self-serving low-lifes (but not really evil), some brave knights (but certainly no paragons of virtue).  They act more like real life people placed in a medieval setting.  Which I find quite refreshing compared to the cut and dry \"good guys and bad guys\" that populate so much bad fantasy.  Just a warning however: don't get too attached to any particular characters, because they may be snuffed out unexpectedly by Martin.  I know I was certainly dismayed (but in a good way) over some characters in this book / series.Plot:  The plot is probably the tightest, most intriguing, and overall best written I've seen since LOTR.  It is absolutely captivating.  This is a book you will fly through despite the length (800 or so) simply because you can't put it down.I guess that'll do it for now.  My advice is clear: read this book!  The language of imagery are sometimes vulgar, but don't let this dissuade you from reading one of the best fantasies ever written.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    They fixed the typos on the Kindle version\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The mistakes on the Kindle version, cited in earlier reviews, have been fixed. I was dithering on this purchase because I'm not into fantasy and only got into Games from the HBO series, so I already knew the plotline for this volume. The book is worth reading because it flushes out the characters and families and dynastic relationships more, and characters I do not care about (Jon Snow) or actively dislike from the TV show (i'm not even going to look up the spelling for...Dany) are more relatable and human-like, esp. Jon Snow, who comes off as a heroic lead. I still cannot get past some of the dialogue from Dany and her Khan (\"my sun and moon, star of my loins, etc\"), but cannot tell if it would have been okay in the context of the novel if I had not heard the actress' stilted delivery first. Knowing what happens definitely takes away from the read, and I have heard people say that of the show if they have already read the books. Plot is a big part of the read if you are not a diehard fan. I think you have to choose one--either the show or the book for your best first encounter. I'm not sure if I'm going to continue with the 2nd volume as I know what happens, but it is a good summer read. I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm so impressed with the totality of the world Martin has created. It's probably what I would give the novel if I hadn't already known what happens. 3 stars if you've seen the TV show and are not obsessed with family crests.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I LOVED IT!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have all five volumes of a song of ice and fire audio books on my ipod and I love them all. I put them all on one play list and the play list was over eight days long, so they are very, very long. If you don't like long books this series is not for you, if you have hours and hours of driving and/or working and would like to listen to a great story to pass the time these books might be for you. It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time. I like all five volumes equally I think of them as one very long story.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Issues.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book had so many gushing reviews that I decided to DL to my Kindle without even sampling. My bad, won't do that again.I think my biggest problem is the rampant paedophilia that weaves in and out of the plot. Honestly? I don't need to read about the wedding night (and ensuing pregnancy) of a 13 year old girl to some barbarian behemoth twice her size, didn't need repeated sex scenes between both of them afterwards (got the point the first time) and especially didn't need any more details about the \"pillow tricks\" the little girl gets taught. What did these add to the plot? Nothing. They didn't even influence or deepen the author's characterization, because neither character develops or grows or changes as the result of these encounters -- the barbarian is a standard undeveloped Barbarian With Decent Side and the girl basically learns to stand up to her brother (who, btw, has a fondness for pinching her nipples - but the \"boob thing\" in this book is a whole nother story). She's thirteen, gets sold to a barbarian horde, is raped nightly, and is apparently not remotely traumatized except that she gets a bit weepy during her introductory chapter. Yeah. Okay. She gets a pretty pony for her troubles though.Characterization in general was poor. There are a half-dozen (or more?) characters whose POV we delve into over the course of the book (tangent: this actually got very irritating; I'd barely get into one person's story before being teleported to x other location and having to start getting back into that person's story before POOF, moved again to some tertiary character's plot). None of the characters had a voice that could be remotely qualified as individual, except maybe the Imp's, but what characterized him was \"I'm evil, except HUH, I'm not, because I keep doing noble things.\" Not exactly stellar writing. The author also fails at writing children (maybe because he makes said children kill/copulate/witness a zillion deaths before they hit puberty, at which point they are basically treated by the author as short adults). One exception: Arya. I thought she was the most convincing of the young characters.The bastard children. Seriously, too many bastards -- the men in this book apparently have massive uncontrollable libidos & have to get it on with every comely wench that crosses their path. They have no need for Viagra in Standard Medieval Land (TM). The King alone must have six kinds of herpes.The direwolves. If the author was going to put so much importance on these creatures, I would have hoped that he would have researched what it's like to attempt to domesticate real wolves to at least lend a tinge of believability to that particular thread in his plot. I couldn't get over the dires being as obedient as triple grand champion border freakin' collies. Sit. Stay. Guard the door. Back off of that man whose mouth is currently in your throat. Write a dissertation on Paradise Lost. Okay.Now for some Kindle version grouches: the eBook edition is full of typos and badly OCR'd segments. You get random parentheses, dots, commas, etc., in the middle of sentences, as well as inexplicable italics on words that have no business being italicized. Words with two Rs in them frequently got digitized as having an \"m\" and vice versa. Those kinds of errors slap me straight out of the story.Now for what I liked: good fight scenes, and overall excellent world-building. I like the Black Whatevers living in the frozen Armpit of the World. Great plotting and effective use of the multiple POV perspectives to pull it all together (even if there were way too many characters). Too bad those multiple POVs weren't coloured by actually individual character voices. Wonderful political intrigues and a great set of support characters who were actually more interesting than the main characters (Littlefinger, and the Standard Effeminate Eunuch, for instance).I would not read this again and I wouldn't recommend buying it for the reasons outlined above. I rarely review but I want to share my thoughts on this, lest someone else comes along and is swept away by the buoyant tide of gushing that swept me along and right out of ten bucks and several evenings of reading.\\n  \\n","3":"2.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A song of ass and fire\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Awesome\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"16"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Read this book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Tolkien got me through my youth.

The tv show moves really fast and I felt like I was missing little details, plus I wanted something to give me my GOT fix between seasons! So I decided to read the first book and see what I thought. The book follows the show very closely. I found that the book helped me to better understand connections between the characters that I had missed while watching the show. I also would say that generally, I prefer to read the books before the movie/show, but in this case I'm glad I watched the show first. The world and the people are so elaborate that the show helped me have a good mental picture while reading. I really don't know what I would have thought of the book without the knowledge from the show. It is a good read, a pretty fast read, but it is so chocked full of details that I worry I would have gotten lost along the way. Overall, I would say that whether you watch the show or not, the book is definitely worth the read.

Martin.  A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series.  We are introduced to the land of Westeros and the principal Houses that rule the land.This fantasy series is organized and narrated differently from most of other books you might have read.  Basically, all of the story is told from character POVs.  Now, ofcourse, that is basically how all stories are told, however, this book is specifically arranged and the chapters are so named with that idea in mind.I am also a big fan of Jordan's The Wheel of Time series.  If you like WoT, I suspect you will also like A Song of Ice and Fire series.  However, please keep in mind that Martin writes for a more mature audience than Jordan does.  In Martin's series, good and evil are not clear-cut black and white.  And themes of betrayal, incest, brutality, and violence are ever-present on every page.  Martin's book delves more into politics and human relations than does Jordan.  However, I believe Jordan has more of the \"fantasy\" elements in his series.  I prefer Jordan as a story-teller.  He is the more inventive of the two.  However, A Game of Thrones is far from being bland.  It's just as enthralling and captivating as The Wheel of Time.  Just bear in mind that it is not suited for young audiences.A Game of Thrones starts off slow at first.  The pace crawls at the start.  However, the pace will pick up as soon as the major players are introduced.  And just like any other novel, some chapters will captivate your interest, while some will not.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Delivers\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I finally gave in to peer pressure and decided to read this series, although I'm generally not a fan of the fantasy genre at all.  This is the first in what is currently a four-book series, with the fifth currently in the works.  The focus is on two families, the Starks and the Lannisters, which remind one strongly of the Yorks and Lancasters from England's War of the Roses as they scheme against and battle with each other for control of the Iron Throne.  At this point the reader's favor is going to be largely with the Starks, as they're the family being spotlighted, at least in this first installment.  Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell is a good and honest man, but when he's asked to travel south to act as the King's councilor, it's a catalyst for the tensions that have long brewed between the families to openly erupt.  Meanwhile, unbeknownst to either family is a long-forgotten bloodline trying to make an unexpected comeback to power.It's a dark story, with lots of violent death, fighting, and betrayals that might surprise even a hardcore fantasy reader.  The reader spends a lot of time getting to know the sons and daughters of Lord Stark, and I imagine the rest of the series is focused on their growth and development, and then maybe beyond them to the next generation.  There are some nice fantasy touches with creatures like ice vampires and direwolves, and snaking through the tale is the menacing threat of the long, deadly season to come, and which they're all dreading:  \"Winter is coming.\"I'll probably wait a bit before reading the second one since I can't take too much fantasy at once, but I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.  The ending definitely left me hanging.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Wow!

I came across book one while doing a search on Amazon for a new read. Wow, wow, wow! Anytime a book can make me laugh out loud, gasp loudly or cause me to sit up as I read while making sure I didn't miss a word, the author has me as a loyal fan for life. Sometimes while reading a novel, you can kind of sense where an author is going, and while I read book one, I had this feeling more than once, only to discover I was wrong in my thinking and something unexpected happened instead. This is a great read for all avid readers, regardless of what genre they prefer. I've never purchased fantasy books before, and only purchased this one because my eldest son loves the HBO series and often mentions it on Facebook. I thought, why not? So, so, so glad I did. Very satisfying. My only sadness is the remaining books in the series are ten bucks each, and although not a lot, I need to come up with fifty bucks (or forty) to finish it. I'm sure they're worth every cent. Hats off to GRRM.

But this is not Europe, and this novel and series is about a fantasy world, or a different world, or a different time.  The technology is roughly equivalent to Europe in the Middle Ages, but this is not that place or time.  And there are many differences as from our world, such as the existence of mammoths, dire wolves, and other creatures long extinct.  Also, here be dragons.  Perhaps the most interesting feature of this world is the apparent complete lack of technological progress -- the kingdoms and cultures of this world are said to have existed in much the same form and state for thousands of years.This is a story of rich living and hard dying, struggle and battle.  The characterizations are incredibly rich, and half of the fun of this series is following each of the many complex characters in this complex interwoven story.  Even those who normally are not much for fantasy or \"swords and sorcery\" are likely to find this novel and series to be captivating and well worth reading.  I did.

It has a world (and a tone) that reminds me very much of Lord of the Rings. Incidentally, GRRM can ramble a bit the way Tolkien often does. But it also has a more...gritty look at the world. This book can be gruesome, make no mistake. It's bloody and violent and the ages of some of the characters may make you do a double take. But the characters are extremely well crafted and diverse, the history is well thought out and the story line is just fascinating. All and all it is an excellent read.I knocked it one star, however, because this is one of the few books I would advise people to watch the TV show first if you are able. GRRM throws about a hundred characters at you at once and it can be extremely difficult to understand who is important and who isn't without reference. I tried to read this almost two years ago and failed because the amount of characters was overwhelming. But after seeing the show it makes it a lot easier to know who to pay attention to and why you should pay attention to them. And interestingly, l've found enough difference between the two mediums that it's still interesting even though I know what's going to happen. So if you want to read it but struggle with the overwhelming formation, try watching a couple episodes and see if it doesn't make better sense.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am still in awe of the storytelling and world building.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have read this several times.

If you are reading this review wondering if you should purchase it, the answer is a resounding yes with 1 caution. Martin is very slowly turning out the latest books. At this pace it will be 2025 when finished. Robert Jordan died before completing The Wheel of Time. That could be a very real piss if Martin doesn't at least maintain the current glacial pace. The world he has built is tremendous. His storytelling is very real and feels more grounded than anything else I have encountered in the fantasy genre. It reads almost like a journal of real people that lived long ago in our world.I'm trying not to review the series, only book 1. It is an excellent beginning to an amazing ride. It is the excitement of the ride up the hill before the big drop off the coaster.Buy it, love it and the other four as well and then sit in line waiting for the next one with the rest of us.

What I love even more is the realistic base that this series draws from. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed years of rereading tolkien, and ashamedly have read most of the dragonlance series. However I've grown quite tired of the D&D world of fantasy and often have read more historical based material due to this.George R.R. Martin has created one of the most enthralling stories I've read in years. I've just concluded book 3 in this series and eagerly started book 4. What a wonderful epic and a very serious one at that. It's easy to see why HBO choose to make this into a upcoming TV program.To stick to this book let me just state that you'll find a few better beginnings for a story. It's a quite lull that eventually cascades into a momentous storm of grand scale. If you enjoy a multi-character driven plot and a long journey to the finish line this a great series. However if you often get bored of a single book, or get easily confused with lots of strung together plot points this may not be the story for you. It often leaves you chasing several issues at one time, for the focused reader it's very rewarding. Again, this can be very cumbersome if you don't like detailed and complex story lines.Never does this feel overwhelming, it's just great story telling and gives so much depth. I've enjoyed big saga's before(i.e Dune and it's surrounding volumes) and this story is truly gripping and fresh.If you like to read and enjoy intense, dark and gritty material this will give you a ride worth the admission fee.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Haven't I Read This Before ?\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    In many parts of the book, I thought \"haven't I read this before\". Some of the things are so similar to Tolkien that it's unnerving. It's like how many sci-fi movies are one-offs of \"The Matrix\". In the first half of the book, it really started to bother me, but the second half got better.Perhaps because the second half starts to develop the characters better. I'd read that the series lacks in character development. I'd have to agree. Throwing more and more characters into a story does not equal character development. It's rather thin in that department.There's a lot of emphasis on sex and female anatomy, which is surprising. It's not constant, like I would expect in some types of novel, but it keeps surfacing. Kind of like someone with sexual fascination or obsession issues. The emphasis on sibling sex and marriage, to keep the bloodlines \"pure\", was a bit of a surprise. Unfortunately, it might be the only novel thing that I gathered from the book.Having said all that, it's readable and entertaining. I did want to keep reading and find out what happened next.The descriptions of locations and people's physical appearance were very good, making them life-like.There are tidbits of wisdom thrown in. It's a good way of getting people to think about things without being obvious about it.Overall, recommended.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Exciting But Too Long...\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The start of the long story is exciting and make it difficult for me to stop reading.  The dilemma of me to decide to read this novel by George R R Martin was a \"want to\" or \"don't want\" decision.The reason  of \"want to\" being that the author has great imagination to write the novel with interesting characters. Each character he created has distinct characters and through his pen, he allows me to visualise his creations.  Another reason, which is cliche, the novel receives pretty good reviews and has turned to be a TV drama (though I had not watch any seasons of them).The \"don't-want\" is simply the story telling of AGOT is way too long.  I am not a very patient person to sit thru each book reading that requires 1 month.  With more of his literature making, I am afraid that my attention to this novel will be dampened.  For example, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter 7 fantasy parts nearly make me give up and I have to keep on going back to the previous book when beginning the new release of a new part.  The long lapses of time create my \"memory lost\" and forgotten the last \"happenings\" of the story line. I am worried that I have the same experiences with AGOT.No, I am not saying that this is bad story.  In fact, it is good and go for it if you love fantasy, medieval times.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"17"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Interesting read.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I'm a very novice book reviewer as, typically, I just tell friends I enjoyed it and that spurs them on to pick it up themselves, but here's my concise take on this book.It's an excellent read, but not for those without patience. George Martin takes his time to develop an intricately woven story with it's fair share of moving parts. His attention to small details is phenomenal and adds new depth to the story. I found myself recalling small details from chapters past as I read the book, admiring how a small seemingly innocuous word could have such a large meaning a few pages later. This fantasy novel doesn't progress through major battles, like other fantasy novels might, and at first I was a bit off-put by it. I was so accustomed to being fed scene after scene of battles that I almost didn't continue reading, a mistake I narrowly avoided. The magic is in the fine print. He's a storyteller, the \"how they made it\" is almost as exciting as the \"why\", and the consequences are even more so. The book strings you along by changing the character being narrated. At some points you're an honorable father, in others a fearful damsel, but each chapter leaves you feeling incomplete, you must read on to reach the cadence.All in all, this story is well thought out, well written, and pulls you in. If you don't believe me, pick up the trial of the book using any kindle application, be it phone, pc, or tablet. The first chapter is as good as any (and the trial goes much further than that!)\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Good condition\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It came in great condition and it was really big too\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Epic Story Telling\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I just finished the first tome of the series. It is incredibly intense, well written, with a killer plot. In the beginning I got somewhat confused by the myriads of characters that were introduced. In the Book Extras on my Kindle, I was able to read up on the individual characters, which helped with my reading pleasure. Plus there's an appendix at the end in which the author breaks down all the various houses and their members.Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the characters. This method of story telling keeps the reader interested and the plot remains fresh. There is a LOT of violence - pretty graphic, and there's a lot of sex - both good as well as horrific gang rapes (in my opinion a bit too much of the latter). Overall, this book is not funny at all. The only character who has some humor is Tyrion - the Imp. Other than that, most of these people take everything pretty personally; so don't expect comic relief. However, the author manages to get you invested in each character's development and fate. I did cry a few times (no spoilers), and the book ends with a bang.There were some inconsistencies in the story as well as repetitive wording that made me wonder about the editing of this book. However, none of this was bad enough to deter from the wild entertainment that Game of Thrones offered this reader. I'm going to have to get the second volume immediately.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Enjoyable!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I've never read much of this genre (aside from The Hobbit, and that was years ago), but I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend (and the rave reviews of the HBO series didn't hurt either). I'm about 30 pages away from finishing this book and am looking forward to the second in the series! Martin is a great writer--the flow, syntax, and dialogue make for smooth reading and the world he has created feels \"real\". While others find the jumping of POVs to be distracting, I enjoyed the way Martin used it to keep the reader interested. Want to find out more about a particular event from a certain character? Read 100 more pages. The character development is decent, although it might be better without the POV-jumping. For a non-studious read though, I think it's sufficient. As a reader who doesn't venture into the world of fantasy much, this is a book that isn't overly saturated with a world of magic and mythical creatures--that made it a better read for me, personally. I recommend this book for regular readers, but not for those who read only occasionally. With each chapter being related by a different character, it could be hard to keep up with the plot if the book is only picked up once a week.Just a side note--there have been a lot of bad reviews for the Kindle version of this book. Editing issues seem to have been fixed, as my version was fine!\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Wonderful book.

Action, intrigue, and character development move along seamlessly and give the book a very brisk pacing that doesn't feel rushed in any way. I can't say enough good things about the book and I've no doubt that Martin has me in his grasp for the entire series now.I'm not one to get overly bothered by the occasional typo or misspelling, but this Kindle edition is without question the worst edited book I have ever read. Misspelled words, pointless and random underlining, spacing issues, inappropriate capitalizations and punctuation. These problems are severe and seem to crop up more frequently towards the end of the book.If Amazon is going to run an e-book business they need to treat it with the same professionalism that publishing companies do. The number and type of these errors is beyond amateurish and totally inexcusable.Edit (27/08/10): I've contacted Amazon and complained about the terrible editing job done to this book. I've also requested the contact information of those in charge of editing the book and will be writing them as well. Hopefully someone will take this seriously and future Kindle buyers will enjoy a much less maligned experience than myself and others have with this otherwise terrific book.Update (14/9/10): Amazon Customer Service has said they have contacted the publisher about the editing problems, but cannot say when or if a re-edit of the Kindle edition will happen. For my troubles they have given me a $10 promotional credit good towards my next Kindle purchase.

To be honest I did not become a huge fan until season two. However after that point I've really fallen in love with the HBO series. I've watched season one and two countless times to get every little bit of info I could out of them. But I needed more that the show wasn't able to give me.So I picked up this book on my kindle.I was blown away. I like the book much more than the show, no disrespect to the show.I've watched Harry potter and lord of the rings before reading the books, and liked the movies more for both. But here, even though the show does the books a great service, the amount of detail in the book is astonishing. And it's presented in a much more memorable way. I felt season one of the show was overwhelming with so many characters and things going on, but the book really gets you anchored in the world. Deaths in the show are kind of a gimmick it seems. You tune in to see if your character has died yet. But in the books it's not quite as much of the main purpose.If you haven't seen the show and are just interested in another fantasy, medieval, genre book. I highly recommend it.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Must Read.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Game of Thrones had become a must read for any fan of fantasy or historical novels, maybe even everyone who enjoys novels at all.Yes, there are many, many characters in this series, too many for some readers tastes. Almost each one is incredibly complex, however. Many characters are lovable, many more are detestable, but even the characters you hate are fascinating to read about.I remember not wanting to read the Song of Ice and Fire series a few years ago. I was put off by what I'd heard about a lack of magic and the plots revolving more about politics than anything else. I'd tell anyone who has these same doubts to give book one a go, however, as although it could be deemed a low-fantasy book, the supernatural elements that are included are unique spins on common tropes.The pseudo-medieval setting will appeal to fans of historical epics too. Once you hear that Martin was inspired in part by the War of the Roses you can really see it in the plot.Overall, if anyone hasn't yet read these books; or has only seen the TV series, I'd definitely recommend it. The TV series is great, but you still miss a hell of a lot without reading the novels.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    What a story!

The characters each have their own personality...some you love, some you hate, some you pitty.  There is magic interspersed throughout the story, but more like a background of something lurking in the shadows.  It is realistic in the way that the author makes you relate, love and root for a character, yet doesn't spare the character any pain just because you love him/her.  There is a place in the story called the wall, and there are those who take the 'black' (they are soldiers sworn to protect the realm) and we are given glimpses that there is something beyond that wall that is evil and terrifying and mercyless, yet we never fully know what.  All the while the kingdom within that wall fights among itself a Game of Thrones, where some are so cruel that they would do anything.  There are secrets that the author drives us to read more to find out more.  The descriptions are extraordinary and I would almost compare this book to the world of JRR Tolkien, but perhaps not quite.  The only thing I would warn about is there are explicit scenes of nudity.  Personally I could do without these but I won't take away from my rating of this book simply because the story is beyond amazing and I could overlook these and they add to the story.

My friends from work (we're all line cooks) wouldn't shut up about the show. Always comparing the books with the show, squeeling like my daughter over a new doll. Finally, after having enough of all the hype I decided to join in on it. I decided to alternate between the books and the show (only finished 1st and 2nd book, and season one). Not so much immediately, but fairly quickly I became enthralled in \"A Game of Thrones\". I was expecting LoTR knockoff, but instead got something far more entertaining in my opinion. Events change so quickly within the plot, that it's refreshing. It's a thick read, but also a quick one. Yes, the amount of dialogue and characters can be overwhelming...I found myself rereading chapters for security. Seeing the show helps a little I think. I realize the show plays with the timing of events, and doesn't cover everything but I feel it does an honest effort. Of course the sex and deceit is one of the book's core appeals so I won't touch upon that too much. So to get to the point, if you hear somebody ranting on about the books or the show then by all means take a couple hours to read some of this book and you may just thank me.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I'm hooked!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have not watched the HBO series, but all the buzz it is generating compelled me to read this book.  I am definitely hooked and stay up way to late reading.  I am currently on the third book.I would characterize this as adult fantasy.  Most of the fantasy I have read is PG-13 and very heavy on the magic.  This is rated R and heavy on political intrigue.  In fact there is very little magic in this book at all.  (There is a little more later in this series.)  I like magic in fantasy, but some authors use it too heavily.  Martin keeps it mysterious.Each chapter is titled with the name of the character it is about and it is from that character's point of view (POV).  Martin does a great job writing from each character's perspective, and interestingly, even though you will have favorites, there is no judgment passed.  My favorites are Tyrion and Arya.  Others have commented that Martin does a great job writing his female characters, and I have found this to be true.  Some of the characters are children and he does a great job of writing from their perspective, too.  It is all very convincing.I read this on the Kindle and did not notice any editorial or formatting problems that some have reported.If you are an adult, enjoy complex stories with grey morality, and are not intimidated by large books, you will love this series.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"18"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    HOLY COW!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I read a lot of sci-fi fantasy, but I rarely read historical fantasy.  More often than not they're magic-driven and make me feel as though I'm reading some kind of history text/comic book hybrid.  After uncontrollable yawning, I never finish them.  So when I read a review of Martin's latest in this series in TIME last year, I was intrigued.  It's very rare that a fantasy novel gets a review, much less a spectacular review in TIME. I thought I'd take a chance on this one, and I am THRILLED!The organization of this book annoyed me at first.  Each chapter is a sub-plot from a different character's perspective.  I got over it fairly quickly, though.  Martin propels the story forward using this style, and for me, it never got boring in the 800+ pages I read.  Magic is present, but not really discussed too much, and when it's used, it's never good.  I found that surprising and refreshing.  It was kept just under the surface until it was necessary, and it wasn't used as a quick remedy for holes in the plot, becuase there were none!I've read the complaints that this book is violent, \"sadistic\" and perverted - hogwash!  There is violence (there's war) there is sex (there are people), and there is perversion in that there is incest, but the incest is a blip on the radar; it occurs among nobility - not fantasy, if you ever took European history.  I was not offended, nor did I find any of those elements to be overdone.  It all contributed to a GREAT read.  Needless to say, I had plans for home-improvement this weekend, but painting can wait.

I can go with that, although Tolkien will always be my first love and his prose is far better than Martin’s. I was assured that I’d find great characters and non-stop action. That is unequivocally true. Sooo many characters that it does get a bit confusing, but all of the viewpoint characters are outstanding. It’s a bit frustrating to have the book shifting back and forth between so many storylines and chapters that end with nail-biting cliff hangers. Frustrating and compelling; although my interest in extended battle scenes is limited, I had a hard time walking away from this book.I had the kindle edition and the audio version performed by Roy Dotrice. It took me a while to get used to his voice, but overall I liked his interpretation. I just found that the print edition made it easier to keep track of characters and events. There are so many details to absorb. it’s easy to lose track of things as the plotlines and viewpoints shift. I will definitely continue with this series, but I think I will get paper copies of the other books.

As is usually NOT the case, the DVD follows the book more closely than any series I can remember, and that's a big plus now that I'm actually reading the book.  I also have a mental picture of what the characters look like from the DVD, and that helps as well.All that said, I still prefer the book over the movie in nearly every case.  The book has the time and space to fully develop each character, the plot, and the 'world' it is taking place in.  Martin's writing is compact and dense in plot and characterization, but not to the extent that it bogs down the story.  He makes the complexities of life as a Stark or Lannister absorbing without getting lost in verbosity. There are multiple plot threads running at the same time, yet his break points make it easy to keep track of each one without having to go back and reread to pick up the threads again.I already know what is coming in this first book because of the DVD, but I can't put it down because there is so much there that couldn't be transferred onto the screen.

It took me 6 days to finish the book. The first 304 pages are not dry at all... very engaging. Let me describe myself:1. I am not a reader of books: I do read periodicals and technical books out the wahzoo but the last book I actually sat and enjoyed was \"Makes Me Wanna Holler: A Young Black Man in America\" by Nathan McCall almost 10 years ago.2. As a general rule, I loathe fantasy books despite labeling myself a hardcore fantasy roleplayer. I always felt that most fantasy books were so predictable, lacking character development and plot. Also, many faults lie with relying too much on magic, magic items, great monsters and beasts and in the end, have you really experienced anything different that you hadn't heard/read/seen before?So when I tell you that this book is the one, do not be so quick to judge my lack of experience in fantasy book genre. The greatness of this book is that it deals with real characters, real character development and plots as heavy and thought provoking as you can ever experience. Best of all, it does not rely on magic, magic items, great beasts, superheroes, etc in order to tell the story.Do yourself a favour, like I did, and get the entire series. You will be glad that you did.When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.

I'm quite comfortable with fantasy novels and Game of Thrones is probably similar in quality to The Hunger Games but doesn't come close to either the Harry Potter series or The Lord of the Rings. Book One sets up the warring factions of which there are about four (plus an infinite number of sub-factions) and then allows them to clash... The author has focused on two or three characters from each of the factions and has managed to portray most as flesh and blood creatures with good and bad points (although several could compete with Voldemort for viciousness).Having chosen a good format (each chapter focuses on one of the main characters) the author manages to stretch each chapter with unnecessary details that bog down the plot rather than taking it forward.As far as I am concerned, the zombies were overkill. Manipulating these factions should prove to be tough enough with its direwolves and dragons and other strange critters, without the zombies, which I found to be a major turnoff! I have started the second book in the series, but am not convinced that I'll read them all. Since there are no half-stars I upgraded it to four instead of downgrading to three.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"19"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    arrived in great condition\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Buying used you are never sure what condition the book might arrive in, but it was pristine!

I am not sure if anyone has said this yet. Most likely someone has since there are over a thousand reviews. But this is not really fantasy, it is a soap opera set in a Medieval English outfit. It reminds me of the show on HBO called the Tudors. But that at least was oriented around King Henry. In this book and this series the story is all over the place, exactly like a soap opera. The soap is always appearing to go somewhere important but never gets there.I have to say that I think that the author mixes the two genres well, and manages to keep the reader hooked. However, I felt in the end disappointed, becasue of course, soaps really never do lead anywhere, and I suspect this one won't either. If the author is the post modern literary novelist I suspect he is, he may well pull a Thomas Pynchon on everyone and have the story unravel in a very unsatisfying fashion in the end. I kind of hope he does. Gravity's Rainbow, however, did it first.Maybe someday students will be reading this series in university literature classes and talking about how it deconstructs the expectations of the novel and the fantasy genre. But, of course, that has all, already been done. So in the end, I am not sure what the point is.  It is just a good soap. It is entertainment in this endless cheap episodic fashion. One where you learn to not care too much for the characters, but then do anyway, and then get  jerked around when they die for no reason, or change. And life can be this way too, it very often is, in middle school. It is the most shallow level of entertainment one can create when one writes. One writes just to keep it going, not with a vision of life, of meaning or purpose that is being expressed or explored. It took me a while to figure it out, but once I got it I read it on the surface to see how the two blended only from a literary interest but it added nothing to my life.In the end, there is nothing but the sound and the fury. For me at least, I look for something and someone who writes with a deeper vision of reality. See, \"100 years of Solitude.\" Not someone who can just keep a 100 balls in the air. And to close my argument, this series is now on HBO, being shown in episode after episode, just like a what, you got it, a soap. I think fanasty would be better off sticking with its own genre conventions and then working to express them in new ways rather than blending genres and cheapening the genre itself.\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"19"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    what an excellent book!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I bought this book based on recommendations. So many of my friends talked about the show, but I'm that person who needs to read the books instead...or at least first.I decided to see what the fuss was all about. I tried reading the sample of this before and never got through it. I never thought I'd be into this type of book AT ALL. I made myself read the sample again, and before I knew it, George R.R. Martin had me hooked. I purchased the book immediately and dove into a world unlike anything else I've ever read before.This is NOT a light, easy read. This book required actual thought or I'd get lost and forget who was doing what. There's a lot and I mean A LOT of characters to keep up with and remember. It was very confusing in the beginning.Now that I'm about to start book 4, I remember everybody and talk about them like they're my old friends.But I do have to say, A Game of Thrones was my favorite book so far. there's just something about that first book in a series. George R.R. Martin, as much as you infuriate me with killing people, you are a genius and you keep me coming back for more.I highly recommend this book and the rest in the ASOIAF series!!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"19"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Can't put it down.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I think perhaps the best way I can sum up A Game of Thrones, and in fact the Song of Fire and Ice series so far, is that it's so REAL compared to others in the genre.1. Not everyone is all good or all bad. Of course, some are \"more good\" than others, but even they have faults and reasons to question allying with them.2. You don't know whom to trust. So many agendas are on the table that even those you think you know will surprise you.3. Characters interact with each other differently on different occasions.  There are no \"char X = sweet and humble; char Y = evil and harsh\" constants throughout the story.  People are complex and varied, with different motivations on different days.4. People make mistakes, and suffer the consequences. No one is safe here, and people don't always learn from their pasts, or even their own advice.5. People die. Main characters die. Again, no one is safe.Martin creates an enormous melee where both the prizes and weapons are power, loyalty, love, honor, and life.  He provides us with the god's eye view of it all and allows us to see through the different character's eyes...although what we see is distorted by what the character _believes_ is taking place at a given moment.  Due to jumps in time and space from character to character, we may or may not know the truth of the facts presented.  Sound confusing?  It is, sometimes.  But the effect is breathtaking...to truly be immersed in this world and to not know what will happen next, to try to figure out who should win, and who in fact will win, to try to reconcile the losses...to this is what fiction should be.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"19"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Get Ready For A Massive Read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Rating this book was hard for me at first. I do like it a lot and it is different than any other book of it's genre. It is definitely worthy of a five star rating. I decided that my reservations were completely my own though and not the fault of the book. I will present them anyway in case they might be helpful to others.The book is long, really long with lots of characters. Now, while that helps to make this a great book, it is easy, for me anyway, to forget who the characters are and where in the story they belong. I found it helpful to get the book on Kindle, which aided in keeping track of characters with it's \"one touch\" search system.Also, because it is the first book of a series, it means I will have to read the rest of the books, all equally as long from what I can tell, if I want to see the story through to its conclusion. So far, I've read the first two and trying to decide if I want to continue. The books are so good that I probably will but it's like looking at the peak of a really tall mountain trying to decide if I want to take that first step.I hope this helps.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"20"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent Book But Requires Extreme Devotion to Fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    While GAME OF THRONES is an excellent book, it does not tell a complete story.  It was over 800 pages long, and each succeeding book seems to be longer still.  While I enjoy an occasional fantasy novel, reading this series requires a devotion to fantasy that I do not care to indulge in.  So far there are five books,  with an indeterminate number still to come.  One fears that the author will die of old age before he tells the full story.  So having read, and enjoyed, the first two, I will not read any more.  When I was a teenager I read THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and I remember that Tolkien remarked that it was too short.  A fantasy trilogy nearly two thousand pages long was quite a novelty in those days, so that comment struck me as odd.  Now it is the norm.  I don’t consider that a good thing.The HBO series follows the books quite closely, except for having more graphic sex, and Tyrion is a handsome midget rather than a deformed dwarf. It is rare that the movie is as good as the book, but in this case it about the same.  I’ll stick to the movies in this case.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"20"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Original and unexpected\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Let me start by saying that a fantasy story set in a land with a perpetual or very long winter has always appealed to me.That was the first reason I bought this one. That said, the book exceeded my expectations. All too often great fantasy stories follow a set plot: Little boy or girl, gets chased around,pursued by the evil one, develops his/her magic power/fighting prowess, comes back kills the evil one and gets the girl/boy as the case may be.This is not that kind of story. After completing the book, I am still not sure who the villain is. (Except for the evil queen) Or even if there is a villain. All the characters'actions follow their motives and personalities, in a coherent fashion. The plot twists and turns, and keeps you guessing. After a while you realize that you really do not know how it will end. The story just absorbs you.There is lust, violence and subtle eroticism; incest, treason, nobility and heroism. All the ingredients are there for a great series, and Martin weaves the characters and their motivations in a complex tapestry that really moves the story along.A word about technique, each chapter is written from the point of view of one of the characters, and the chapter is named after the character, which helps keep you oriented.A useful appendix is present at the end, which would be very useful had I read it before the story. Alas I had only the PDA download, so I did not know it. Also, if you get the PDA download, the maps are so small as to be useless.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"20"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Issues with Kindle version have apparently been fixed\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was reluctant to buy the Kindle version after reading the reviews about the poor editing and typos, but I decided to try my luck anyway. I'm glad I did because I didn't have any issues at all. There were one or two instances when I noticed a very minor typo, but that hardly ruined my enjoyment of the book.And yes, I did enjoy this book so very much! It's definitely not your typical ~epic fantasy~. It's driven a lot more by characterisation than by action and magical fireworks. I think it's safe to say that the characters ARE the plot. If you like scheming and gossiping and intrigue, then you will definitely have fun with this.In the interest of being fair and including something negative, I will say that I had to really concentrate in the first few chapters to keep track of everyone that was being introduced (since the point of view changes so often). But eventually I got into the flow of things.As most previous reviewers have said, there are quite explicit references to sex, rape, and general debauchery, but it's generally no more than a few sentences and easy enough to skim over if you don't have the stomach for that sort of thing. Personally, reading some of the negative reviews here almost scared me off, but I would definitely recommend you give the book a chance, because it really isn't as huge a part of the story as some people have made it out to be.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"20"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Game of Thrones\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I saw the HBO series before I read this, so that had an influence on my imagination while reading. However, I liked the story, though it seemed a little muddled at times, and if it weren't for seeing the series first, I would have been much more confused during the reading. There are a lot of names to keep track of, some being players in the story, others being regarded only in way of heritage or historical. The plot, well, the plot is murky at times. Don't expect a \"dark lord rises and heroes assemble to defeat him\" kind of point a to point b plot. This is low fantasy, where struggles happen on a more personal level.I see a lot of reviews complaining about the sex in this book. Either I'm far more desensitized than I realize, or people are confusing the book with the show. Yes, HBO likes to show naked bodies and some soft albeit brief, erotica. But I found the book far less gratuitous. The scene (in the book) between Jaime and Cersei was mildly graphic, but nothing excessive. And when Cat is walking about the room naked, there's no description of her body doing this or doing that while she moves. That's left to the imagination.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"20"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Even better then the show\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book was great as I had expected.

Each time I read new parts I eagerly share what was in the book with my boyfriend who has only watched the show. I frequently get \"wow that's not in the show\" from him. So I am also helping to give him a better understanding of the characters.I love how this story has alternating points of view, I think it helps get into the mind of the main characters. I am eager to read the rest of the series. This was a really well done series. Its not over the top on the sex and violence like I was thinking.

The intricacy and complexity of his novels and the story he weaves from the viewpoint of multiple characters is incredible.As to the book, I'm not going to summarize as I'm sure there are other reviews that do that. All I'm going to say is, while it's a great book, it isn't for the weak of heart or stomach. There are some very harsh realities and the amount of incest, backstabbing, and general debauchery is astounding. The best way to describe this series is to say reading it is akin to watching a trainwreck occur in front of you. You don't want terrible things to happen, but happen they do, and you can't help but keep reading out of morbid curiosity. This isn't a feel-good novel. None of the Game of Thrones books are. But they are unmistakably real, consistently full of twists, and endlessly entertaining.I'd dock a star for the outrageous pricing (I understand this is a popular book but I have a great hatred for publishers who insist on pricing e-books at eight or nine dollars apiece, or more), but this isn't the place to review pricing. 5 stars for the book, 1 star for the idiot publisher pricing on a Kindle book.

It is a very enthralling story. If you like the HBO series, read the book. A lot of detail is left out due to the encapsulating effect even a mini series can have, such as the details of battles and relationships in particular. It is also essential to read the book in order to fully understand the characters in depth, but that is typical.Just as a side note, I was surprised by the difference in the amount of sex in the mini series compared to the book. I am not offended by it, but the series adds entire characters and story lines related to this that are not in the book. I find this rather odd. There is so much depth to the book that it is sad they added these elements instead of elaborating on missing portions of the book. As an example, not enough is made clear in the series about the importance of the direwolves and their role. This is crucial in the book. Instead, the side story of Greyjoy and the path of a local prostitute is added? It will hook the lusty, but adds nothing to the original story.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"21"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    *APPLAUSE!*\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am not an avid reader of fantasy.

I was absolutely riveted throughout every single page! I devoured this story and quickly ordered A CLASH OF KINGS in order to find out what happens to all of these fascinating characters. Martin has created a storyline that is bold, heart-wrenching and breathtaking. His words weave vivid mind pictures, and reading this book is almost like watching a movie---I felt that I could actually see the scenes taking place throughout the novel. Eddard, Arya, Jon, Daenerys, Viserys, Khal Drogo, Bran, Old Nan, Sansa, Tyrion, Catelyn, Jaime, Cersei---and I could go on! All these characters are fascinating. The story focuses on political deceit, murder, quests for power, magical spells, ancient warnings, intrigue. There are sword fights, plunderings, all-knowing wolves, and cold, dead things that walk in the night. I can't wait to sink my teeth into the next installment of this series. How will Jon fare on the Wall? What happens to Arya? Will Sansa be wed to Prince Joffrey or will she find the strength to fight against his black heart? What will happen to Robb? I need to know!I can't say enough good things about this novel. If Martin can maintain this type of storytelling, then he has one more loyal fan to add to his list. This is definitely a must for fantasy fans.

In truth, I didn’t know about the books until HBO picked it up as a series. I’m so glad I discovered it.Imaginative fiction isn’t new and the bar has been set very high in the genre. Tolkien’s Middle Earth and C.S. Lewis’s Narnia were unparalleled until Rowling introduced us to the wizarding world. But in the background, Martin created the fictional world of A Song of Ice and Fire and his world building skills are among the best. The people and places found in A Game of Thrones are exceptional creations and the rules Martin established for guidance are extraordinary.I feared the multiple viewpoints would be hard to follow. But each thread stitches together a vast and fascinating patchwork story. The characters are diverse, intriguing, and at times their motives are unclear. There are those hungry for power, others who live for honor and still others forced along a path not of their choosing.I’m in it for the long haul now.

Honoring the written page perhaps, but not leaving much else for the book to tell.  The character inner voices and motivations are there, the deeper story.  Also, the character descriptions do not fully match the casting in my mind (the cast is twice as old as the characters in the book for example).  Still, the spirit of the setting is captured very well.  Re-occurring Machiavelli life lessons concerning the pluses and minuses of honor, duty and station are entertaining, and a joy to review from both historical and present philosophical view points.

There are two types of characters in the book.  Those who are completely despicable and self serving, willing to burn their own house down with their family inside to gain a momentary advantage.  And those who are loyal, brave and totally devoid of any intelligence.  One reviewer stated that he liked the book because you couldn't tell who was going to die.  I disagree.  I found any character that was sympathetic in any way was destined to eventually die a brutal and horrible death.  If I wanted to read this kind of story I would pick up a history of England, or of the French-English wars.  The world is governed by a complete ast system in which all of the nobles are decptive bastards with not one shred of intelligence.  I will finish this series, but don't think I will pick up any more of Martin's work.  Even Elric of Melnibone had more life than Game of Thrones.  The best ending to the series would be for the comet in the sky to strike the planet and wipe everyone out.  That would be a more hopeful world than exists in these pages.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"21"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I finally see why everybody is soooo crazy about it!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    For years, people have rambled on and on about GAME OF THRONES, and all the while I was not interested. But after many cast interviews, and observations of the political goings-on, I thought, \"Alright! ALRIGHT! Let's see how they did.\" But before I could watch the first few episodes of the first season, I had to read the first book. And that's exactly what I did! And you know? It was most rewarding. Personally, for me, reading about Arya Stark turned out to be more fun than watching her on the show. Same goes for Jon Snow and Lord Eddard Stark. But the one that I was really hooked on, next to Snow, was Tyrion Lannister. An educated soul among a very masculine, not-so-educated family. I really can't understand how I did not hear of A Song of Ice and Fire when it was out in the 90s. I CANNOT!!  Anyway, after reading far enough into the book, I started the series. And the rest is history. It is way beyond The Wizard of Oz.

I did in enjoy it, and did not have to labor through weighty tome. The characters are well written/described, the world is laid out rather tediously and by half way through the book you think you know what to expect. But plot twist after plot twist arise as the story reaches its, and from there it is difficult to put down.The mechanism GRR Martin uses for the narrative (3rd person limited) for a set of characters builds anticipation like few other books I've read. At times it becomes frustrating.My only complaint is that there seems to be no end to the cunning and intelligence of the \"evil\" characters, while the \"good\" characters hold fast to their idealism. They are constantly able to out maneuver and out wit the \"good\" guys. This isn't necessarily completely off-putting because there are small victories, and I don't mind a darker, more unpredictable story that isn't blatantly good triumph over evil. But his brooding sense of melancholy and cynicism to tend to make the book easily predictable by the end (haven't read the series, but I wont be surprised).All in all, good read and highly recommended, I give it 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of the book, even with the flaws/complaint.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"21"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Justifiably acclaimed\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This book is amazing in terms of its complexity and vivid action. The main characters are very well developed and the action scenes are captivating, even if somewhat incredible at times. As the first of a series, it builds up a huge cast of players in multiple locations, the relationships between which become quite a challenge to unravel. And, of course, many subplots remain unfinished; actually, all of them do. I was shocked by the callous cruelty and unashamed sex; in fact, the general lack of any kind of morality is disappointing. The one noble character – like so many others – gets snuffed out rather ignominiously, after we had set high hopes on him. The occasional elements of fantasy – supernatural beings like zombies and dragons and the warped flow of time – seem almost superfluous, as do the hints of some religiosity among some of the characters. Although the story line is so enthralling I would be tempted to read the subsequent books of the series or watch the apparently even more brazen films, I choose not to, because a) it would take too long, and b) they would have a negative moral influence on me.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"21"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A must read if you're a fan of the TV series\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The ability to see characters' inner dialogues and better understand their motives as a result is one of the main reasons books are always better than their TV/movie counterparts. I first got into Game of Thrones from the HBO series and have absolutely fallen in love with the show and its massive cast of characters. Although I originally didn't plan to read the books, I decided I owed it to George R.R. Martin to read the books responsible for creating one of my all time favorite shows.This is a LONG book, but a highly enjoyable read. You really get a little bit of everything, and even though there are fantasy elements they really take a backseat to the spectacular cast of characters. I enjoyed getting into the heads of some of my favorites -- Arya, Daenerys, Jon Snow to name a few -- and loved getting to relive everything through their eyes.My only complaints are that the pacing seemed very slow, and I struggled a bit in the beginning. But once things picked up, I had a hard time putting this book down. I'm looking forward to reading the remainder of the series, maybe I'll even catch up with the show! Def read this if you're a fan of the series.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"21"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    DON'T even start this series!

And Daenerys (surviving child of previous King) is very very boring to read about...her stuff could be condensed to fewer and shorter chapters. (She even bored me in season 1 the HBO series based on this book - which by the way is more like watching porn.)By book 3 the focus was less and less on these main characters and more on others. Very obviously in there to add more volumes and not to make the story more interesting. The story seemed to be expanding for the sake of expanding.  As if getting more complicated makes you a better author.I might have stopped after book 3, but since there are only 5 books I went on.  ...it took me FOREVER to get through book 4 (because it just wasn't holding my interest - so much of it was wasted on stuff I didn't care about and missing the characters that I DID care about).Now I'm reading book 5 and a good chunk of it should have been in book 4 because book 4 went PAST this, and now it's taking you back to fill in details.  Stuff you might have wanted to know THEN, but now that you already know what happens the going back for details is just frustrating... and I'm reading in a pissed off mood now wondering why the hell the author didn't just do it in order of events unfolding or leave it out?  It's like someone dropped chapters on the floor and they just picked them up and printed them out of order.  (I think more thought goes into planning the lineup of songs on a CD!)I'm frustrated wondering why he is wasting my time on these other characters and why isn't the story progressing more towards a conclusion - or at least being more interesting in the process?Book is 5 so clearly not even close to the end of the story which had I known this, I would not have begun! (Especially after forcing myself to read the whole dang series by Robert Jordan - which could've/should've easily been half as many volumes!) In books 4 & 5 the story barely advances at all - who knows how many volumes this is going to end up to be to get to the end.  And at $20+ a book it gets expensive to finish a series.I really wish authors wouldn't do this.  They get a story idea that's good for a few books and then make a deal to deliver WAY more volumes which means they have to complicate it with more and more meaningless fluff and sub-stories.  More volumes doesn't make it a better story!!********************************************************BOTTOM LINE on this book series:  DON'T even start this.********************************************************You might want to try reading books by Brandon Sanderson or Terry Goodkind instead. (Goodkind did pretty well with his long series, managing to keep the story moving along - though around book 4 he was constantly catching up readers who perhaps didn't read previous volumes, which gets annoying, so there could've been less volumes, but it was nowhere near as annoying as Jordan and Martin).  Or, for a more modern day fantasy series, I HIGHLY recommend the DRESDEN FILES series - lots of snappy wit in those and good story in each volume.\\n  \\n","3":"2.0 out of 5 stars","4":"22"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A great start to a great series\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I give this book five stars!I read this novel a few years ago and just finished the second book, a Clash of Kings recently. It took me a while to finish A Clash of Kings, compared to A Game of Thrones. I found this book to be original and I took to it very easily. When I started the second book, it started off harder to read as compared to A Game of Thrones, but I am glad I went on and finsihed A Clash of Kings, it was worth the time and effort.I find myself supporting the Stark House in the series. At the end of A Game of Thrones I found myself liking and feeling sorry for Arya, so that helped me read through A Clash of Kings because I wanted to see what would be come of her. While doing that, I found myself liking Bran and Jon Snow. So now I just started reading A Storm of Swords, to find out what happens to these characters.Tyrion is also another character I like in the series, he stands out from the Lannister clan and I think that is one of the reasons I like him.I recommend this book, Martin is really developing quite a story and I can not wait til I read the last chapter of the last book. The books can be hard to follow, due to the POV way he writes, because there really is no connecting of events so see how things are progressing. So I read Wiki articles and that helps unite everything.

J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books are enchanting, and T. H. White's \"The Once and Future King\" gobsmacked me with its brilliant take on the legend of King Arthur.George R. R. Martin's \"A Game of Thrones\" isn't quite in the same league as Potter and \"King,\" but I admire Martin's ambition.  Creating a huge cast of characters and detailed description (too detailed at times; must we learn the name, lineage, and attire of every knight, peasant, and maiden in the story?), Martin unveils \"Westeros,\" a mythical land bearing a strong resemblance to medieval England, and one in which warring clans battle for control of its Seven Kingdoms.  It's a (mostly) believable world, but it never really captivated me the way the Potter series did, and it lacks the charm of \"The Once and Future King.\"  It is not, however, short on graphic sex and violence.\"Thrones\" is a long book, the first in a planned series of seven volumes.  This might be one of those rare instances where you are better off watching the TV version on HBO, rather than investing weeks, or months, of your life on this massive written opus.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"22"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Masterful story telling at its best\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    What a brilliant book!  I perhaps am one of the few who has never watched the television series, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew I wanted to experience the book first.  I am so glad I did as book one of this series was a hidden gem I never expected.  George R. R. Martin is simply masterful at character development.  All the major characters have chapters devoted to them throughout the book, and each character (and hence chapter) has its own unique voice.  The plotting of the book is fast paced (even though the book is 800+ pages long) and suspenseful.  The world of \"The Game of Thrones\" is familiar, yet also fantastical.  The tales in it is a celebration of the creativity of Martin, a wonderful story teller extraordinaire.  As I read this book, I was reminded of Herman Wouk's brilliant \"The Winds of War\" / \"War and Remembrance\" which developed characters and storyline equally as deftly as Martin has, which for me is no mild praise as Wouk's 2-book series was the best I've ever read.

Many threads are left unfinished; in fact only one thread really reached a climax, and it closed the book. This bothered me, as I read an 800 page book and felt like there was no satisfaction from the work in reading the massive volume. Other than that gripe, this is good storytelling. It's not filled with a lot of excitement like Stephen Erikson's books, as its more character and story development, that is similar to the style that Stephen King has mastered. In fact it felt like I was reading Insomnia by Stephen King, but in a fantasy setting, where there was some unbelievable character development, but really not a lot going on. With good storytelling the fault is always chapters that you question why they are even in the book? But as you get to the end of the story, you realized those little chapters really gave the reader a better understanding of the character and/or story. So it moves slowly, but it is worth it.So far with the first book I have not seen the excitement that this series garners, but I do see the intelligence in his writing. His character development as mentioned is top notch!But this is standard fantasy fare, and even has the cliché dragons *shakes head*, although they do not really make an appearance, you only hear about them. If you have read Stephen R. Donaldson's Mordant's Need, then you'll know what to expect with this book. A Game of Thrones is aptly titled, as it focuses on the politics of a kingdom, and all the deceit that goes on behind the scenes.If you wanted brilliant descriptions of battles like Erikson writes, you'll be sorely disappointed. There is only one battle that is told in first person and I might have to say, it is the worst detailed battle I have ever read. All the other battles are told in third person by a squire or someone similar, which really disappoints because you were led up to a point, switched to another story thread, and then you got switched back and were given the aftermath.It sounds like I'm only complaining but this is a good story, and told very well, along with the fantastic character development, this was a very enjoyable story. It also is pleasing that it is adult fantasy, shows some gore, and as mentioned by others main characters are killed off, so no one is safe. I always enjoy authors who do this, and Martin has pleased me in this aspect. Even though this book is no masterpiece it shows a lot of intelligence, and with the open threads that have been left unsolved, there looks to be a lot of promise in this series. I will definitely read the next book A Clash of Kings.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"22"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    So begins the game of thrones….winter is coming.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    So begins the game of thrones….winter is coming.What I liked most about this book was that you really got the feeling you were reading something different and special. Martin doesn’t focus on the traditional epic battle between good and evil as many fantasy books do….there are clearly good and evil characters, situations, and dilemmas in the story but that is not the ENTIRE focus. In many ways you are left to make up your own mind about the situation and characters.I especially loved the prose…though it was complex, it was elegant and engaging. I loved how the language and tone of the book mimicked the cool romanticism of Winterfell and yet left you feeling warm….just like the cold, harsh landscape the reader is able to find warm within the tone of the book just as one finds warmth in the walls of Winterfell.I found myself compulsively reading, unable to stop. Though the foundations of the story were lengthy and complicated and at times I found myself distracted–re-reading or referring back to the wiki to navigate the story–but that did not put me off to the book, in fact I HAD to keep reading because I HAD to know how everything was going to fit together.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"22"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Very good book.

Numerous references to later plot-lines are made which just goes to show how well developed George R.R. Martin's fantasy world is. It's a little odd to read this book after seeing everything that comes after this part of the story on the TV show. Since I know what's coming, it does detract a little from the books. And I know that certain choices Eddard makes are terrible as I'm reading instead of figuring it out in hindsight.I am enjoying myself though. I'd compare the pacing in the book to that of Breaking Bad. It's very steady. giving you time to take in everything that's going on before jumping into the next piece of the story.So for TV show watchers that want to get into the books, you'll still enjoy them. There's a lot of changes made between the books and TV show that you'll notice right off the bat.

I put off reading it for some time, but finally ordered the book.  I struggled through the first 100 or so pages of A Game of Thrones and it was on the verge of getting lost in the pile of never to be completed novels I have lying around.  Luckily, something \"clicked\" once I got past the initial setup of the novel and I became truly hooked.George R.R. Martin paints an amazing tale of a medieval time, set in a fictional world.  The story advances through the points of view of various characters scattered throughout the enormous world.  This allows for the reader to become close to some characters, while coming to despise others.  This makes their downfalls or triumphs that much more satisfying or heart retching.A Game of Thrones takes a more realistic path, as opposed to something like Lord of the Rings, initially, but the seeds have been planted for fantasy elements to emerge, and by the end of the novel, they begin to sprout.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written novel that has twists, turns, and everything in between.  By the time I got three-quarters of the way through this book, I placed an order for the next three books in the series, so I wouldn't have to wait to start them.

I've tried to read Lord of the Rings twice and don't get farther than book 1.A Game of Thrones is really good.  I liked it, but there are a few points that I want to mention.First, it's long and the point of view writing style means you'll forget some key facts throughout the novel.Second, Assumptions, George thought that I would know who \"Ned\" was the first time he mentions him.  (He's Eddard, I had to Google it).Third, I really don't get a care about Sansa or anything she does.  Why is she even a PoV character?  She was a waste of time, space, and her content is boring.Fourth, reading it on the Kindle was great, but having to go back and look for key facts, like what is \"Ice\"?  (It's Eddards sword).  And who the hell is Brynden?  The character and house summaries at the end of the novel would have been gravy at the beginning.  I wish I knew that it existed before I finished it.A few negative points, but overall a good story.  I just hope it doesn't turn into Robert Jordan's Book 10 tea description in a later book.

I don't know the War of the Roses, I don't care about the War of the Roses.... all I know is that each of the many characters that are introduced in this first volume are fascinating and very individual.This book is very violent, and gives a feel of medieval times - set in a world whose history is recorded in thousands of years.  There is magic and magical creatures throughout the story, but the story is about the people involved in the various situations - not the magic or the creatures.Each chapter of this book is told by a set of major characters - some of the narrations are connected, others are not, and yet, the book is never difficult to understand, I never lost the plot lines (and there are many) and after each individual narration, I found myself in a different place with a different person - wanting more from the previous character and yet dying to find out what was going on with the current character.I highly recommend this book - even for those of you who feel that the fantasy genre is way overdone!

I plan to be caught up with all 5 books by then, even if each one is 800- 1,000 pages. Yikes. These books are page turners. Books that you find yourself looking forward to sitting down with.

In a sense, many of the characters have just as much of a right to the Iron Throne in a complex plot where each want their claim to rule- and tensions rise and war breaks out- all in what can be considered a \"game\" of thrones.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"23"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Book, Not So Great Prints\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    PRO: The story is unquestionably interesting and complex.

It's truly a total sensory read with characters you love (and hold your breath that they'll survive) and those you hate (and can't get enough of).It might be easier to just follow the action on the TV series, but the read is worth the investment. There is so much more than on the screen, I've committed to get ahead of HBO and read the next offerings in advance.

It is narrated in a way so appealing and immersive that it's epic size goes almost unnoticed. There are layers and layers of complexity interconnected that make the plot interesting and fun to read. Descriptions are top notch.My rating of 4 stars comes for a consistent presence of errors(typos?) in the kindle edition.

There's nothing like reading this series to really make you greatful to live in a republic, or just about anything other than an oppressive, authoritarian land where one person runs the whole show. Yeesh!This book is the start of what is technically a fantasy series. It draws heavily off real history (most notably the War of the Roses), and actually contains surprisingly few fantasy elements, at least at first.The characters (all twelve million of them), are generally well-drawn, and there are certainly those I like spending time with and those I don't. The setting is fairly imaginative, if somewhat iffy (I really, really get annoyed at fantasy realms where they have institutions that date back thousands upon thousands of years, but in all that time the surrounding cultures and technologies haven't changed one bit).The writting, as I've come to expect from other Martin works, like the Wild Cards series, is fast-paced and interesting, with plenty of political intregue, plotting and scheming as well as lots of blood and gore.But, boy, I'll tell you.

Most of the book had been spoiled for me by people who had watched the show. Avoid them like the plague or use a book cover so no one will ask about it. I love the descriptive style of the book and friends who had read this had told me that it would be a difficult read. I personally didn't find that was so.

I found myself still laughing, crying and rooting for the beloved characters but only now able to know them on a more personal level.  While Game of Thrones is my favorite show on TV, this book is truly a stand alone achievement whether you watch the tv show or not.  The book provided me with more knowledge of the seven kingdoms, the character's motivations and more backstory than I expected.  I also expected it to be hard to read like some other fantasy books I tried (and failed) to read before.  Fortunately it was a smooth read and I am downloading the next book immediately.

I hesitated to read it because reading the Harry Potter series sort of ruined the movies for me. So I bought it and was going to wait until I watched the first season. After 2 episodes, I weakened. Fantasy is not a favorite genre, and I don't read it often. I was blown away by both the TV series and the book. That doesn't happen much. I love stories from multiple POVs. The characters were well developed. I have to say the Martin is a little long winded. Excellent prose or not, it shouldn't take 10 pages to write that Arya chased a cat into the dungeon before overhearing a conversation about her father.That said, I thorough enjoyed this books and bought the next 4. I just couldn't put my Kindle down and read it in a week. Dany and Tyrion instantly became my favorite characters. It broke my heart when he killed of Khal Drogo. I know killing main characters is on of Martin's signature moves, but I think he missed an opportunity to keep him around a bit longer. Oh well. I loved it anyway.PS.

Some of his character and place names seemed unimaginative and derivative, and others way too similar (e.g., Arrya/Arys).Matters are not helped by the incompetent editing and profusion of typos in the Kindle version. \"i£,\" should you encounter it, is 'if' and 'Your' is frequently rendered as 'Tour.' You can probably figure out that 'sells word' is 'sellsword' but you shouldn't have to. A few sentences and paragraphs just stop; italics and hyphens appear at random. These errors were distracting and are not present in the paper version, so apparently at some point the publisher had someone who knew how to proofread and edit. Considering how much time I invested in this, I'd have been better off reading my used paperback copy and ditching the Kindle. The good news is that they don't charge extra for the errors, you pay the same price as the paperback.I'm giving it five stars because GRRM shouldn't be punished for the incompetence of his editors.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"24"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Winter Is Coming\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This series must be read in order.

Envy, greed, love, honor, and betrayal are just some of the motivating factors that drive the characters' actions.)

The books are very well written and incredibly descriptive which makes them very hard to put down. One thing to note is that each chapter is focused around a specific character and the author likes to leave you with a big cliffhanger at the end most of the time and then not go back to that character for anywhere between 50-100+ pages which may drive some people crazy or keep you reading, it definitely had me looking ahead to see when I would have a chapter about that character again.

BORING. BORING. BORING. I don't understand all the raves. I guess I don't like it for the same reasons other do:While I don't like formulaic fantasy either, sometimes a \"formula' exists for a reason. I don't need black & white good and evil, but I would like to LIKE certain characters. I want to root for SOMEONE. I get it- make the characters flawed, human (or not) etc., but the author will present the character in a certain way, and then have them do something completely outside the character. Cat Tully for instance- strong, supportive, brave....impetuous and stupid. I couldn't help but think- go ahead and behead the woman- when she kidnapped Tyrion. Are we to believe she'd really be that stupid because she got spotted in a inn? Ned is courageous, honor-ific and so loyal to his king- that he alters Robert's will. Huh?Also George is afflicted with the Stephen King disease: toomanyuscharacterus. How many main characters can you fit in a novel? I need a chart or a Dummy Guide. I lose track of who I should be keepng track of.And last but not least: enough with devoting 4 pages to a freakin' banquet/feast and every stinkin' banner and standard. After ten feasts I don't CARE if its roasted duck, quail, pig or Lannister. I don't CARE if Sir Stabs-A-lot has a bluebird on his chestplate or a ball of flaming crap. Enough already! Action, sex, carnage, whatever- all better. I appreciate the intricate details but after awhile they obscure the story.Oh, and one more: I think when George thought it was getting boring he threw in a little....fantasy. Seriously- 3/4 of the first book is all medieval, lords and ladies, war and games and politicking. And then suddenly...toss in a dragon! Bring on the witch lady! There wasn't really any fantasy until the very end. Make up your mind George.I am trying desperately to finish book Two, but after that I am done.

I always insist on reading before watching when it comes to books, and I'm glad I did.  It takes a while to get the characters/family alliances/backstories straight (if you ever do), but it's well worth it.  DO NOT get attached to characters (I'm guilty as charged).  Pace is slow-average, but necessary for character development.  The format is not a cohesive beginning -> end; each chapter follows a character so their stories are unfolding somewhat simultaneously.  You may also go a stretch between \"hearing\" from characters (i.e., Daenerys is one of my faves and I feel like I have to read through 10 chapters sometimes to come around again to her story).  The plot is interesting and dramatic, and I'm constantly being shocked/outraged by unexpected events!I would recommend even if you have watched the series.  There is a LOT that is glossed over/skipped.

He is absolutely splendid in this role and provides such a convincing diversity of character voices that I continue to be amazed at each new one, however transient that character's appearance.  He engages the listener in a variety of subtle ways, with masterful pacing and tone.  I feel it would be redundant of many of the other reviewers to explore Mr. Martin's writing, but I will hazard a few comments.  I am new to his work except for his short story in Jack Vance's Dying Earth collection (which he also edits) but that was sufficient to get me started with his magnus opus.  The character development is complex and carefully considered, especially appreciated with my professional background (doctoral level clinical psychologist).  He develops many intersecting plot lines and works nicely between them.  The setting is engrossing and the realism of the scenes readily facilitates a \"willing suspension of disbelief\" (which I think is attributed to Shakespeare), ranging from intense battle scenes, interpersonal conflicts, and sweeping drama.

Marton creates such a rich, living world with believable characters, each with their own motivations and personality traits. The plot is divided into small chapters changing in viewpoints from each of the characters, allowing for the a fast paced story line.Martin frequently surprises with plot twists and witty dialogue exchanges between characters, I laughed out loud and cursed characters names, often in the same chapter. Whilst violent in some parts, I found that Game of Thrones focuses more on the politics of the court as 4-5 families contest the throne. Martins writing style is quite brief and to the point; he spends little time describing scenes or characters appearance, relying more on dialogue exchanges and characters actions in order to portray each characters personality traits. The only real complaint for this book is that it is easy to lose track of characters due to each chapter introducing a large quantity of new knights, shields or families. However, Martin does provide a family tree of each major house featured in the story, which helps to digest some of the new individuals when things become too much.

Case in point is that the pacing is a bit sluggish at times ... but I dont mind authors taking their time to tell their tale, as long as the ride itself is enjoyable. And as an amateur cook, and a former SCAdian, I rather enjoy detailed descriptions of food and clothing. It helps make the experience more real.This series, so far, seems to be a very solid and highly entertaining read ... I just ordered the next 2 books in the series, and I'm very much looking forward to finishing the one I'm reading now.Highly recommended.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"25"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    greatest fantasy series of all time\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George RR Martain did something amazing with this series. He made me realize not every idea had been used up in this genre. I read Tolkein when i was in high school and had a feeling every time i read any fantasy book that the author was just regurgitating a formula which Tolkein had already done. Even some considered to be great authors of fantasy....say Robert Jordan for example. Martain truely did something new and fresh. He made a unique fantasy world that is interesting even to non fantasy readers. He is also a master of craft. I think one of the most difficult things for an author to acheive is switching between characters in a large encompassing world and having it not be confusing and not seem contrived. As though painting a literary picture in this way actually makes sense. His characters all go though a journey during the series.....but unlike Tolkein,Jordan...ect.ect it's not a literal journey i have to read about for a million boring pages of characters being \"On the road\" It's a journey of growth and learning in the characters own mind....you end up both loving and hating almost every character at some point in the series. Very human....and when characters feel human...it makes it easy to become invested inthem. I can't say enough to recommend reading this series rather you are a fan of fantasy...or just of dramtic literature.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"25"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Rape, Pedophilia, Violence, and Bad Writing\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    1) The author does NOT write well, in my opinion. The book is filled with clichéd phrases meant to take us back to the Middle Ages: \"lady wife\", \"lord father\", \"mummer's farce\", \"call the banners\", \"leathers\" and \"silks\" when referring to items of clothing, \"smallclothes\" for underwear, the list goes on..... The sheer repetition of these phrases took away from my enjoyment of the book. Also, the book is far too long.2) When referring to the male contribution to sex (or, more often, rape), the penis is the \"sex that hangs long and heavy\" and male prowess is achieved in just three thrusts. Ugh.3) George R. R. Martin's imagination as to architecture and coats of arms (which he calls \"sigils\") is remarkable. Unfortunately, Martin's mind is immature and he gives no thought to the infrastructure that has to support everything from castles to roaming armies. One castle is so high up in the mountains that it takes climbing and elevators to reach it: how does this protect the farmers and herders around it? The roaming armies assemble when there is a \"call for banners\" but there is no description of the supply chains necessary. Only the leader of an evil army \"burns as he goes.\" In short, these are the imaginings of a pubescent teen, and a very sexist one.4) The author hates women, does not understand sex as adults do, punishes the girly girls in the book by making them stupid, promotes the marital rape of a 13-year-old, who then falls in love with her husband-rapist in a Stockholm Syndromey way, and allows children of 15 and 13 to lead armies, while the 7- and 4-year olds are told to grow up to full adulthood.To summarize, I find George R. R. Martin creepy, sexist and immature. When I read that he frequents the fantasy conventions, I was not surprised in the least. When I learned he's had a girlfriend (whom he only recently married) for thirty years I WAS surprised, and very disgusted with what I imagine is their sex life. When I saw a picture of George R. R. Martin: a fat man with a bad haircut and a scraggly beard, wearing some sort of cap, and in black satin for a black tie party, well... he's a nerd. No surprise there.The man is a sexist obsessed with pedophilia, violence against women, and I believe he'd be happiest at a tacky Medieval Fair.Please don't waste your time. Watch the series, which captures the beauty of George R. R. Martin's fantastical architecture, and read something else.Edit this post | Permalink\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"25"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fantasy injected with political intrigue and moral gray\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I never watched the show, so I came in largely a blank slate. My goodness, what a book! Martin crafts his world with a little spice from all different corners of fantasy, but please don't get discouraged if you don't like fantasy. This isn't a simple Good vs. Evil story. There's political intrigue, backstabbing, rituals, and magic, and Evil sometimes gets to win by using these tools. I would warn you not to get attached to characters, but you likely will. And your heart will likely eventually get broken.If I have a complaint, it's that Martin can sometimes go a little overboard with descriptions of things like grease running down beards while men eat, but it pays off when Martin successfully transports you into his world. There's a moment during the jousting tournament, when things go sour, that I felt I was actually in the middle of the hubbub. And I had a hard time putting the book away from that point on.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"26"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Addictingly Good\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fantastic books!

I literally spend the entire time reading them with either my hand over my mouth in some kind of shock or actually laughing out loud. I've always been a sci-fi/fantasy nut, but these books tap into the my guilty pleasure of loving a dramatically twisted story. While I don't know if George is the best writer, he is one of the better story tellers I've ever encountered. I am completely wrapped up in whatever he is saying at the moment.His characters are so interesting and he has the gift for making you like the bad guys. He also has a flare for killing off main characters, so don't get too attached. These books are very addicting and Martin takes his time writing them. If you plan to start reading A Song of Ice Fire, try not to read too fast...if you can.Book 1: The first book is very fun, since you are getting acquainted with a lot of the main characters you'll come to love.

Still a great read all in all as eventually (I'm about 75% through this book) clarity comes, but not to the degree it did in the movies. As the age old script read \"read the book before watching the movie\". It holds particularly true here. However, there are more books in this series, there are no more movies...so take it from there.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"26"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Simply one of the best series I've read\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have read many Science Fiction and Fantasy series prior to this one, including LOTR, Sword of Truth, Shanarra, Wheel of Time, Thomas Covenant, Dune, Foundation, etc. They all have their merits (and some demerits obviously) so I would never try to rate them relative to each other. I can also say that (for me) it seems the enjoyment I get out of a series is somewhat dependant on when I read it. At some points in my life I am 'more ready' for a particular plot or character than I am at others.In any case, the Song of Fire and Ice series of books is exceptional in so many ways. I find the characters interesting and multi-dimensional, the plot twisting in intersting and fulfilling ways, and the POV writing to be a great way to keep the scope of the story large while and get across emotions... not just events. I also particularly enjoy the fact that the writer is not afraid to kill off a main character at any point in the story. Just as would happen if this story were true. Its nice to know that the charcters are truly mortal, unlike some of the stories I mention above.I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading, not just fantasy.

I was pleased that he began developing his characters so clearly, turning them into real people, from the very first page (that seems to be rare in fantasy).But also from the very beginning, there are inconsistencies in setting that annoyed the hell out of me. I kept thinking, where was his editor?Two examples, from the very first chapter, \"Bran\". It is the dead of winter and they are riding back home, when they discover the corpse of a direwolf by the side of a river:\"Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth.\"In the dead of winter, with ice in its fur, how would the body be decaying badly enough that you could smell it? More importantly: its eyes full of live maggots? In the dead of winter? Not possible.Then just a page later, they realized the animal had been gored by an antler. The father pulls the antler from the wolf's throat:\"A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.\"The wolf had been dead long enough to have already been infested with maggots, yet the blood was still fresh? And again, in the middle of winter, if the body had been dead so long, how could the blood possibly be wet?It sounds like nit-picking, perhaps, but I found the novel full of these kinds of illogical or impossible juxtapositions, where I was suddenly jolted out of the story and saying, \"huh?\" I understand this is fantasy, but when you set up a story with men riding horses through the forest in frigid cold, you are obligated to either be consistent with a general understanding of what winter is, or explain why in this world things are different.The situations and characters are rich and interesting, and Martin is a terrific story teller who is able to create powerful and poignant images. But these lower level inconsistencies left me feeling that he is careless with detail.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"26"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The first step in a long road towards an unknown destiny\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    There are several reviews out there about this magnificent book, so I will be brief. The \"Game of Thrones\" is just the beginning. We get to know the world of Westeros and some of the characters who drive the story forward; we get a glimpse at the most brutal (hence realistic) side of human behavior, spiced up with a little chivalry and honor. The book, and the story is dark, but never brutal for the sake of scaring. I would say that the Latin saying \"Homo homini lupus - Man is a wolf to man\" describes the story best. All the characters have their own agendas, all of them, even the \"good guys\", though, and this is the best aspect of the whole story, it is almost impossible to tell the good guys from the bad ones. George R. R. Martin created a story which is about us, all of us, humans, with all the evil and sometimes good that dwell inside us. The only thing that makes the book sometimes a burden to read is its realism, it is a hard task to face the truth about ourselves. And, I have to tell this again, \"Game of Thrones\" is just the beginning, if you plan to start reading it, be prepared to continue with all the sequels, because the song of ice and fire is far from finished...\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"26"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Impossible To Put Down For Long\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I have been a fan since the first episode aired on HBO a few years ago and it has been mine and my husband's favorite show ever since.

I'd heard that the first season wasn't much different from the first book but my gosh it is EXACTLY like reading the book or vice versa.  I'd actually read passages and compared them against scenes on YouTube and they read almost verbatim.  Well I could NOT put this book down for 2 weeks straight.  It has been a VERY long time, years and years since a novel has caught my attention like this.  I was sneaking and reading even while i supposed to be working lol!  The kindle version was not riddled with mistakes as  some viewers have led others to believe maybe a few slightly misspelled words but nothing that detracts away from whats going on.  You still get lost in the world just the same.  I would recommend this read to any fan of the show!

I mean isn’t that what makes a fantasy a fantasy?  Not so much with this one.Otherwise, the book is a great read, just like the tv show with tons of develop that shows the author loves the world and characters he has created which means it feels very real and alive…just don’t be in a hurry to see something really extraordinary (other than the introductory scene, which teases magical happenings, then turns off the tap for a really long time).So good, but lacking some spark that wasn’t as noticeable with the tv show.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"26"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It's about time\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This is a follow-up of a review made a few years ago (below).This series is like having your favorite Uncle start telling you an fabulous bedtime story.

He does this for two more nights without finishing this incredible tale. Then you wake up on the fifth morning to find your Uncle's gone home without telling you when he'll be back.These stories are fantastic but after waiting for the next novel to come out and have it delayed for over a year, the frustration level mounts. The plot lines are complicated enough that I will probably have to go back and read some of the novels again and that's no small feat for 800+ page books.With the time investment of these novels, it might be best to wait till all are published before reading for once you've started, you will be running to the bookstore for the next installment._________________________________________________________________________After reading Science Fiction and Fantasy for 30 years I thought I had exhausted my search for a well written fantasy book that wasn't the SAME plotline over and over and over!  \"A Game of Thrones\" is well crafted and has intrigue that will keep you with this book to the very end.

I started watching on a whim because nothing else was on. I got totally hooked on the series and would watch several episodes at a time. I finally decided to start reading the books. I am really enjoying this series of books. I started reading book 1 sometime in May, I think, and I'm now on book 4. I'm absolutely hooked! The book has everything to keep me entertained. It has mystery, fantasy, comedy, action, war, love...everything! I especially like the character Tyrion. I haven't actually started reading book 4 because I'm trying to pace myself because after book 5 that's it...the author hasn't finished the final two books. Also, I purchased each book separately instead of the 4 book box set, mainly because I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to all 4 books. Anyway, now I'm kind of hoping that when books 6 and 7 are released that maybe Amazon will offer books 5-7 as a set. that's another reason I'm trying to pace myself.This is a really creative series of books.

I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons of the Game of Thrones television show on HBO. The television series follows the plot of the book pretty well, so I already knew what would happen, but really loved reading the book. You know a story has lasting quality when you're able to enjoy the journey again even when the suspense is gone. I loved gaining all these additional insights into George Martin's captivating characters. It was surprisingly well written and evokes an entire world in your imagination that is more 3D than felt from the screen. I found every character to be sympathetic -- even the ones I didn't expect to like -- as they took their turns narrating their POV. The Stark children are young in age, but are portrayed so maturely that it doesn't feel like a children's book at all. I was a little nervous about the violence and sex scenes. They are somewhat... descriptive, but didn't feel gratuitous or overdone. It's definitely a long book and did take me awhile to get through, but I've already plunged right back into reading the second!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"27"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Awesome yet not typical fantasy.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I don't want to rehash what many have already said. This is an excellent fantasy novel that is the first in a series of 7 projected books. It is loaded with suspense and intrigue. What I liked most was that there was no dark lord and some relic that the young farmboy had to go on a quest to find in order to destroy the dark lord. Which is basically every other fantasy novel. Tolkien ripoffs. This book avoids all cliches. My only complaints are it is 100 pages too long and what is with all the graphic descriptions of animals, mostly horses being killed. That kind of bothered me. Also as others have pointed out, the sex in this book at times borders only slightly on romance novel stuff. I'm not a prude and did not expect a sanitized story, but seriously\"His manhood glistened wetly\" that's an actual line from the book. I could have done without some of that. I would recommend A game of thrones to all readers, not just readers of fantasy as long as you're 17 or older. It is a trip to read.

The main characters from both families, the Lannisters and Starks(=Lancasters and Yorks)are well done.  You might even want to read on this event.The fantasy is well done in that the magic is not used as a Deux ex Machina to get a likable character out of a jam.  In fact some likable characters die before this first installment is over.  With the fantasy aspect you are sometimes left wondering, would things have gone so well in LOTR if the Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves,and Men were having these types of quarrels amongst themselves?  Sauron would be on the move amassing his Orcs and other beasts.  The Good guys would be planning war against people they should be allying with to win, ignoring what was going on elsewhere.  You only see the faint beginnings in this installment.Warning, this is adult fiction, there is graphic sex and violence in this novel.

Some of the Lannisters, being the antagonists, give me the creeps, although I do like somewhat the King Slayer, Jaime Lannister. I'm not that crazy about her sister, the Queen, neither her son. The Imp is a wonderful character also, full of surprises and wit.You'll enjoy the development and growth of characters as Daenerys from House Targaryen; Arya Stark, quite a clever and feisty little girl; and Jon Snow, her half brother among many others. The descriptions of places and events are so rich you can perfectly imagine the characters expressions, feelings, mood, etc. In summary, you have it all, the dragons, the knights in shiny armor, the villains, the heroes and heroines, kings and queens, the supernatural and evil forces; the adventure and the unexpected.

That is to say; Thank God that there is finally an action/adventure/historical fiction-styled series that does not bore me to death or end up being exactly the opposite of what it promises to be.  I have attempted to read stories that either are way too underdeveloped, or suddenly turn from something with potential to something that becomes some sort of dead attempt at a love story.A Song of Ice and Fire was able to catch my attention and keep it.  The way that the book was written, hopping from the perspectives of several individual characters, made the story seem whole and complete.  Each character was believable, as were the story lines.  There is enough real-life intrigue and experience that is seems totally plausible that the story could be real.  I do not want to go into extreme detail here, so just trust me when I say that I am incredibly picky about my books, and I found this one to be very hard to put down.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"27"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Absolutely Incredible Journey\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I've read the Lord of the Rings books and I'd have to say I enjoyed this book more.

I spent an afternoon thumbing through reviews-the overwhelming majority were positive and detailed without giving anything away. I personally found the book to be much more than any review made it out to be, it was an incredible journey unlike anything I'd ever read. It had everything. I read a few reviews talking about excessive gore, profanity, and sexual scenes. I didn't see anything of that nature. Yes there was all three of those facets in the story but not anything insulting or overly used. One caveat I would offer is beware of reading on the internet. Even on news sites the subject of the TV show comes up and you can accidentally find out spoilers for future books.

So for anyone concerned about that part, it's mainly during the horse lords chapters and not written like soft pornography so I didn't feel awkward reading it.In general, I was compelled to keep reading and I am picky with trying new authors and usually stick to my usual.

Characters live and die based on chance and the whims of the powerful. Some heroes die and some villains live.Everything is raw and uncensored, just as life is. He doesn't sugarcoat sex or war. He lays it out the way it is and puts it in an intriguing and ever-changing universe.More importantly, while I was undergoing cancer treatment, a friend asked him if he could send some books to get signed as a gift for me. Instead, GRRM sent him 5 signed books, including a special edition box set of \"A Game of Thrones,\" each inscribed with a personal message for me.So, not only is GRRM one of the greatest writers of our time, he is also a good man.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    He loved it\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It was a gift and the person loved it\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Buying Book Two Now!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Despite how often we seem to get wrapped up in created universes whether it be written (books), coded (video games), or filmed (tv/movies) it isn't as often that you see one created with this much care. If only just finished this one and I already can't wait to pick up book two. It makes me want to have been involved with this world sooner (only I was eleven when this book came out).Martin writes in his acknowledgements that \"the devil is in the details...a book this size has a lot of devils\" though from reading it you would never know this fact unless you read what he had to say about it. The story is perfectly woven together and it pulls you in for all 800 pages.Martin's been called the American Tolkien though I feel like this does him a disservice. Martin's writing is much more fluid, easier to follow, and most of of all, more fun to read. This isn't a review to bash Tolkien but I do feel as though he is given too much credit for his complexities while Martin manages to create an equally vivid world without having to read the same paragraph over and over again to hash out all of the details.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Triumph of Epic Proportions!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Just when I thought there were no more great Epic Fantasy's out there, I came across George R. R. Martin's wonderful novel.  This has to be the best series I've come across since the original DragonLance Saga.Martin's strength is his ability to develop a wide range of characters.  Unlike the characters of most fantasy novels, the inhabitants of Martin's world are varied and numerous.  There is the incestuous and powerful Lannisters, the Noble and Courageous Starks, the rebellious Greyjoys, and the exiled Targaryans (just to name a few).  However, just when you think you have someone figured out, you find out something new about that character, some twist to his or her personality which shows just how ingenious Martin is.  In this, the first novel of the series, he establishes a precedent of killing off characters YOU thought would make it to the end, which adds a bit of danger to this series (something not found in most novels).The plot itself is an intricate one, and I will not give it away.  Suffice it to say that civil war is looming and the only question is when will it happen, not if.  Just as in his talent for creating 3-dimensional intricate characters, Martin is a master at weaving a plot of such depth and intricacy that the reader is left breathless.If you like epic fantasy and GREAT writing, along with numerous twists and turns in the plot, then this is the series for you!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great book!

That means something, doesn't it?Of course, there are some tedious parts, that I wish Martin had skipped, but they are part of the otherwise perfect oeuvre, making it even better in its imperfection.I'm definitely buying the next one of the series - and all the rest after that.Martin is, without a doubt, the biggest name on the epic fantasy scene.I envy those who are yet to uncover the wealth that are his books.To everyone else, happy reading!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A terrific story - but know it for what it is and is not\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It has been a long time since I read fiction.

Reader beware,this book sucks you in. Mr Martin's writing is so effortless and his story so compelling that before I knew, it was 11:30 PM in the night (well past my bedtime!)But know it for what it is and what it is not.This is not a book on fantasy, magic exists but only subtly.This book is not dark...HBO's Rome is dark. STARZ's Spartacus is dark.There is sex but very little of it and no where meriting the fuss other readers made. I would rate the book PG 13 for that.At its heart it is about family drama. The protagonist relocates his family to corporate headquarters and faces a sweltering degree of politics and family squabbles.I would not have picked this book had I known its real genre.But no worries the story will blow your mind.Here is the best part.I am on to my second book \"A Clash of Kings\".

Obviously my own imagination was better!What the author managed to do very well was to create a lot of unique characters. Each character leaves the reader with a vivid image of their strengths and weaknesses.However, I found the author's writing style rather tedious on some parts.

The graphic violence was too much for my tastes. I would be unable to watch a movie or tv show of this book. Nightmares would plague me. I believe only adults ought to read this book. I'm aware that many parents allow their children to fill their eyes and ears with violence, along with sexual content, but I feel strongly against it. I almost regret that the author left so much unanswered since now I simply must find book two of the series!\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Epic Masterpiece\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The hype surrounding this series and the corresponding HBO series are well deserved. The books are so fascinating on so many levels. First of all, the world that the author creates not only rivals, but I would say surpasses Tolkien's. He has immaculately crafted the geography, history, cultures, and religions of a world that is so creative and interesting. The characters that inhabit this world are very deep and rich and also which can often be a problem in epics of this magnitude, consistent in their motives and behavior. The plot twists are equally exciting and believable. As has been well noted, the author is not afraid to kill off major characters resulting in an incredible amount of suspense that is lacking in more cookie-cutter predictable books or series where deep down, you know the protagonists are going to ride off in the sunset. These books are also a great companion to the TV series. They add a whole new layer of depth by explaining more of the background and culture of the world and there are plenty of smaller differences that make it well worth the read.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    disappointing\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I was recommended this series (i did read 5 volumes) because I generally like good fantasy.  I was very much disappointed.  The author writes well, in terms of telling a complex story and creating a fantasy world somewhat like our own but different and interesting.  There is a lot of invention.  The \"magic\" is not too far-fetched (in a fantasy context of course) and has its own internal coherence.  The complexity of the story and the interesting characters, many of whom are likeable despite their complex ambiguity in some cases (bad qualities mixed with the good), made me continue reading, wanting to see how each one ended.However, I very strongly disliked some aspects of it.  First of all, it;s full of extreme sadism.  It seems to revel in the intense suffering inflicted by one person on another.  I found this extremely disturbing.  I have no objection to the sex scenes, except for the almost constant sadism in them.  It's part of an overall acceptance of torture and bullying and meanness that seems to have become cool.I also didn;t like that he creates characters that are interesting and complex and they get into more and more difficulties and then there is no resolution.  Many characters just fizzle out.  If you want to read a grand and grandiose saga, you expect that the characters will not just fizzle out. But perhaps there are more volumes out or about to come out.  It feels like the story that began by being pulsed through arteries, is now being weakly drawn through thousands of capillaries.  .\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"28"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great read, great series!!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Totally got caught up in the series on HBO, so much that I decided I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next season!!!

Luckily for me, I endeavored to read this book quickly, and I found that I  did not lose the vast plot.It is clearly set up for a long run - there  are at least three major plot points to resolve - although I must say that  Mr. Martin seems to be able to resolve extremely complex plots quite  quickly and in quite unexpected ways.  There is a lot to admire about an  author who will kill of a main character, instead of relying on some sort  of  annoying plot twist.  There is also a lot to admire about an author  who will spend multiple chapters building up what appears to be a character  and a sub-plot of amazing signifiance, and then suddenly kill the character  and end that plot immediately.Highly recommended - but be prepared to  either read quickly or take notes.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"29"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love the story, not a fan of the \"enhancements\"\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The story is one of the best, and if my review was based on that alone, no question bit to give 5 stars.  I LOVE the story.  One star was lost because of the annoying \"enhancement\", where whenever your finger accidentally lands on a hyperlink to a character glossary, you leap forward to near the end of the book.  If you are using an App on an iPhone or iPad, this is very annoying.  The instructions to take you back to your reading place do not work on these devices - you are left trying to scroll your way back.  Worse, you can no longer sync to latest reading page, as Kindle seems to use the character glossary as your furthest read page.  The only way to fix, I have found, is via \"manage my kindle\" and clearing \"furthest page read\". This does fix it, but gets old quick.

So, as a newly developed avid reader (meaning I haven't read a book in 10 years, then now this is my 4th in only about 3 months) I was a little overwhelmed. HOWEVER, the flow of the story really makes you forget you're reading so much. Lots of detail (sometimes almost too much) but enough to keep the reader's attention and move the story along. The detail is more for ambiance than filler, which I really like, since a lot of books I've tried to read overkill the detail (and ended up killing my desire to read it).The only real gripe I have is that just when one person's storyline is really getting good... he switches to another character. Yes, this makes you keep on reading, but I admit there are times when I've wanted to just skip ahead and read the next part of that person just because I was so caught up in it.I bought the other 3 kindle books, so I guess that's saying something.

By the time that was done, the sample was over, with no way to tell anything about the story or style of writing. Irritated, I deleted the sample and again vowed to not join the hordes.But then a friend with excellent taste in books told me to read these. Trusting her, I did and am now on book three. While surprised by the number of typos in these books, I confess I'm now hooked. The author has done an amazing job of creating characters I care about. Enough so that I keep reading to find out what happens to them.

But to do this over and over and over and over again for 4000 pages is just the author slapping me in the face. If I wanted to be continuously depressed and heartbroken, I would watch CNN or those ASPCA commercials on loop.At one point I became so passive about it all that it didn't even surprise me when certain things happened. I started to predict it, because the author became predictable with his complete lack of desire to carry out the story in a thought-provoking, interesting manner with mild variation. It became clear to me that the author was just crapping around. It became so bland to me at one point that I was like...Meh.Another thing I hated- things would come to pass and there would be an explanation for them later, but the explanation made no sense/seemed to be utterly unconnected and without precedent. Random, if you will. Probably could have been better if you had a bit more explanation from characters so as to reveal what they were doing but the author is so arrogant of his writing that he believes readers will just accept it.At times- It is well written. It is engaging. It is engrossing. You won't want to put the book down.

I do not like all fantasy books, but this one is well written and well-developed, and I'm glad I have read it.  I like Tolkien, and this is a book in that spirit, although it does not have some of the dryer detailed development that Tolkien does so well, yet which can also slow down a read for me.  On that note, the early chapters contain a lot of storyline that you have to figure out along the way without the in depth history of the realm that some authors may have begun with.  It reads fine, and you do come to understand things well, so that it serves as a great plot development process along the way.After one book, I'm hooked.

I did like the details the book has over the show especially when it came to better understanding the background of the world, but when you have actors like Peter Dinklidge playing Tyrion and then read the description of the imp in the novel it lost something.

I found that having read the book helped me to identify characters and follow the plot when watching the television series, although the TV series doesn’t stick slavishly to the book.  I’m not usually a fan of fantasy but this story doesn’t feel like fantasy – it feels like it’s set back in history or pre-history, which is testament to the talent of the author.

They focus on one group, person, or family and tell a tale of highs and lows.  In most cases things end a bit on the high side, but this is not a typical series.  The cast of characters starts large and gets bigger as the books go on.  Twists and turns in the plot do not follow a predictable path, making each chapter exciting to start and leaves you begging for more.  Well devolved characters leave the story line frequently, only to be picked up a few books later or not at all.  This is what makes this series so much fun to read and so hard to put down when you start.  I highly recommend buying the whole series at one time, you won't be able to stop at just one book and you will kick yourself for not getting the better deal upfront.  That said this is an ADULT series.  I would not recommend buying this for anyone under the age 16 or 17.  The book is graphic and very detailed in both violent and sexual acts.

Be still my beating heart!!!)  But I have to comment on the extremely bad editing of the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones.  It is sloppy and unprofessional.  When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse.  I thought Sacajawea was bad, but A Game of Thrones starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into the book.  People who only read the kindle edition will think that Princess Elia comes from Dome, since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout the book.  (It's Dorne).  But on the other hand, the `tom cat' is a `torn cat'- go figure.  Little things like that at first, but now, in the last third of the book, the mistakes are coming on nearly every page.  Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing.  It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in a free edition of a book (maybe).  But for a Kindle book that costs more than the paperback, I expect more.  I also own a hard copy of this book, and none of these typos are in that edition.  I'm not sure how the Kindle editions are made, but I expect the same kind of professional editing that you get in print books.

This style is intriguing as you are kept in suspense until the next appearance of the character to find out what is going on in one of the many plots/subplots. The Stark family is quite interesting and I look forward to seeing what role the direwolf pups will take. The author has created a unique world and he is not afraid to kill off characters when necessary. This book has lots of action and intrigue.

How in the world a normal person can plot such an intrincate story?, so many characters? How does Mr. Martin creates such elavorate personalities? It's a rollercoaster of intrigue and excitement.I read somewhere that \"A Game of Thrones\" was the equivalent of \"The Sopranos in medieval times\", well, somehow it is. Prepare yourself to get engulfed in the world of The House of Starks and Lammisters, the Black Brotherhood that watches \"The Wall\" up north. Beyond this wall, a terror is rising. \"The Others\" cold and souless creatures are moving forward.Prepare to experience treachery,secret whispers, magic, dragons, rape, murder, poisoning, honor, pain, diplomacy and betrayal at it's best. Prepare to loose yourself page after page inside one of the best new epic fantasies of our time.Mr. George R.R. Martin at least from my point of view can stand proud side by side with Mr. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.The first of six.

While that may bore some ... its incredibly relevant to human nature.I was actually amazed to see the plethora of one star reviews... while the masses still have it correct IMO... I suspect those were looking for something they wanted instead of letting the book take you wherever.I will admit that the subplots seem to be untamed as you move along in the series... and I believe that GRRM is taking time to course correct alot of those. However this is his world and I'm going to enjoy it and expect that it will work itself out.The degree of difficulty on writing this novel on a scale of 1 to 10...is an 11. No B.S!

All my friends had read them and gushed about the genius of of the stories. I felt a responsibility to read them due to my love of literature, especially for science fiction and history so I read them and kept reading them thinking I would have a sudden break through realizing that compelling depths of the story but found nothing for me in them. Now almost 25 years later I caved to peer pressure once again. This time I was astonished by the vivid wordsmith Martin. I actually became enthralled by all the characters and entranced by the world he has brought to life.

Let me tell you, this was a great decision.The book is more exciting than the show. In the book, you are taken through the same events. The only difference here is that you go through them from the point of view of all the different characters. When you are reading a chapter about Ned Stark, you get to see the events from his point of view. This makes them that much more real. Having watched the show before reading, I remember seeing the scenes play out as I read. It was like watching the show through words.As someone who rarely reads, this book was able to keep my attention the whole way through.

The story is rich and compelling with intriguing characters and settings. This is no book you leave by the s***ter for an occasional glance though, far from it. A Game of Thrones' complex storyline demands complete attention whenever reading it. Blink and you'll miss an important detail that will bite you in the ass later down the road. On top of that, it's just about as long as the bible (not literally, but you get the point) and can sometimes fall into a bit of a lull. If you give it the time and a bit of effort though, you'll find yourself immersed in Martin's colorful and entertaining world of 'ice and fire'.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"31"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    GOT Book 1\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you are a really fan or want to began to start to see the series or know the things that are not in the series...you must to read it.

As with any book/movie combo, there is always going to be much more detail in the book which keeps the reader incredibly interested.I am naturally a slow reader and take a lot of time to finish books but for the first time ever, I am knocking out pages in half the time.

Many borrow heavily from each other and only insert a small degree of distinguishing characteristics in their narratives.  When a friend of mine urged me to read A Game of Thrones by Martin, I brushed him off at first.  After continued pestering, I relented and picked up a paperback copy.And I'm glad I did.  Martin is a master of narrative, character development and suspense.  Once you actually start to want to learn more about any character or event, he has you hooked.  His simple language and excellent pacing allow you to fly through books that are +600 pages long.  The only downside I can recognize is that there are a lot of names to keep track of.  This is largely remedied by Martin's excellent index of important families and their followers at the back of each book.  The detailed map also helps the reader keep track of the story's progression and the decisions of the protagonists.Forget the book is about fantasy.  If you want a deep, mature story with rich detail and intricate plot development, you owe it to yourself to give A Game of Thrones a try.

For some reason, most reviews I've read of this book seem to focus on the amount of profanity and sex; this took me aback somewhat, as I did not notice a remarkable amount of either.  Any modern crime novel (most modern literary fiction, for that matter) has far more.  I guess most fantasy must be filled with rainbows, unicorns, care bears, and happy endings.

I didn't find that at all, each chapter follows a character and it is an effective way of writing, as you wait impatiently for the turn of your favourite character or plot line to reemerge.

(I also advise you to make a basic family tree or outline for who's who in the first book. It gets easier to keep track as you go on.) However, these elements are right along side the amazing descriptive language and snappy dialogue and a storyline that is so intricate it's incredible.

While your eyes can feast on the TV world and take in some of the scenic scale, you don't seem to get the intelligence and complexity of the characters as much as you can from a descriptive internal monologue.If you're a fan of the HBO series, pick up the books and immerse yourself further.

Game of Thrones is an excellent book that kicks off a great series of epic proportions. The characters are rich and (extremely) flawed. Each has his burdens to carry. Twists are in abundance, and NO character is safe. People die when you don't think they will, sometimes seemingly by accident.How much you will enjoy the book depends on your preference. Like many fantasy books, GoT can drag on and seem slow at some points. It is heavily descriptive with an abundance of characters, though having watched the show I am a bit thankful for my greater in-depth knowledge of the characters. On the other hand, the book is definitely not fantasy in the traditional sense.  Magic, sorcerers, etc. don't play a key role in the story. They exist mainly in history, and are tangential to the plot. This book is truly about power, and what people will do to acquire it.If you have the time to delve into this long novel (and then the rest of the series as you will no doubt be sucked in) then I definitely recommend giving it a go.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"32"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fantastic!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    George R. R. Martin’s dark and unpredictable masterpiece is a must-read. Written in a style that deliberately highlights the moral ambiguity, distinctiveness, and complexity of the central characters, it is almost impossible to anticipate the direction the story is heading. This novel will appeal to people who are not traditional fantasy fans, as magical elements are deliberately kept to a bare minimum, with most of the focus on Renaissance-esque Machiavellian political machinations in two fictional continents based on medieval England and the ancient Eurasian Steppe, respectively. With that said, the book has a surprisingly emotional tone, with most of the main characters struggling with internal conflict and social rejection.

I'm not sure what is best,  watch the 10 piece series first and read Game of Thrones second or read the book an watch the series.  By watching first you can put real faces to the book caricatures and visualize the castles and land scape easier.  However, by watching first I am now less impressed with the TV show writers.  The script was written for them not by them.  Either way it is a fun read.  Don't miss either no matter which you chose to do first.  I have watched all seven seasons and can't wait for the eight.

The biggest difference, which I was not expecting, is that Game of Thrones was quite a simple read.  It moves quickly between events without overloading you with description and superfluous narrative.  Each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character, which is interesting and helps blur the lines between good and evil characters as readers learn the motivations and concerns of the main cast.  I like the realism of that blurred line; the world is never quite as simple as we try to make it, and Game of Thrones takes that to heart.  I am not impressed overall with George Martin's use of his female characters, but fortunately there was some improvement as the book continued, which gives me hope for the rest of the series.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"33"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Amazing story\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I bought \"Song of Ice and Fire Book 1:Game of Thrones\" Kindle edition (for reading convenience) as well as a hardcover copy (which came with the 5-book Song & Fire series hardcover set) for my book collection.In terms of the story, I became a fan of the \"a Song of Ice and Fire\" series after watching the HBO TV adaptation (\"Game of Thrones\").  I decided to read the books because I was too impatient to wait for the next season to start.  I don't regret the decision at all; though I know the main story lines from watching the TV series, the book's character development and the background history is much deeper than the HBO series (although the TV series is a pretty fair representation of the book's plot lines and character personalities).So basically all I have to say is, if you enjoyed the TV series you will enjoy reading the first book because it offers more history, more characters and more clarifications and revelations in the context of the main plot.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"33"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Just read it already\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    When I first heard of Game of Thrones, I was put off-mostly because I hate huge, sprawling, popular series. I also looked up spoilers on wikipedia and was turned off by the incest and darkness. But it's actually not that dark. Yes, major characters die (no one is safe), and the portrayal of historical life is pretty gritty (though more Renaissance than Medieval at times), but it's not gratuitously creepy or horrific. You care about every character whose point of view the story is told in (and there are a lot of pov characters--not to mention they're on conflicting sides). That's talent.For history buffs, this series is based on The War of the Roses (and probably The Hundred Years' War). For TV buffs, there's a pretty awesome series that's now in Season 3. There's also an official Game of Thrones recipe book. That's why I started reading this series. I read the introduction to the cookbook written by George R. R. Martin and realized, \"Hey, this guy can actually write,\" and gave this series a try.

After watching two episodes, I found out the series was based on the George R.R. Martin book series and immediately ordered the first book from Amazon.  I couldn't put it down and taped the HBO show to watch later...just in case the book and the show took different paths.

When I saw that the third book was completed I jumped to reread Game of Thrones.  However, due to some negative reviews about the Kindle version (and the fact that I couldn't find my paperback) I put it off and almost didn't buy.  Several months later, I could wait no longer and took a chance on the Kindle version.  Are there some typos?  Sure, a handful of very minor ones.  Don't let the negative reviews of the Kindle Edition dissuade you from buying this book.The characters are excellent.  The twists are unexpected (Martin isn't afraid to kill his characters).

Martin surprised me again and again with plot twists and slowly leaking the reader information. It is not a fast paced book, but it is not slow either, a good pace to keep the reader interested.

I'm a huge fan of fiction and fantasy, and out of everything I've read there's never been a fantasy novel that's seemed so real and possible. The story unfolds from multiple viewpoints, and the characters are all intriguing with their own motivations and desires. They're all very human. Some people criticized it for being \"a medieval story and not a fantasy\", I never got that vibe. There's still some fantasy elements, they just don't overwhelm the story and it makes the whole world seem much more real. As with real life, this is riddled with tragedy and despair as well as love and hope, you never get comfortable enough to think a character is off limits, and I think that more than anything is what keeps the pages turning.Easily the best fantasy novel I've ever read and I look forward to the rest of the series.

His characters grab you right from the gate, showing you this will be an emotional ride that doesn't fail to deliver right to the end. Even his minor characters always have something special about them that fills the void with such pleasurable ambiance that you don't want to leave his world. The passion behind each house is so real and yet set apart that even the most vile still have a human side that makes you both despise and empathize. George uses both emotions to strengthen your attachment to the heroes and yet not everyone will agree on which House most deserves to rule.

You actually FEEL like the character, whether it's a child and their random mostly never logical thoughts, to the the cunning and selfish thoughts of an adult. It gives you a different perspective of the same event or plot. The other part is the large number of parallel and intersecting sub-plots. You're never bored, and you just want to read more and more.

Many of these issues begin to resolve themselves as the series moves forward anyways, so don't be put off too much by the first book.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"36"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The Author of the West!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I won't lie, there were parts of this book I found rather dull. Mostly in the beginning. Then the more I read, I started to realize how essential the mundane in the beginning of the book was. The character development and key plot points take a while to develop, but like any house built, once the foundation is laid, the rest of the building is up to the imagination. Mr. Martin has done a wonderful job, in my mind, creating such interesting characters in a world so full of intrigue and adventure. Whether you love them or hate them, following the many different character story lines that all affect one another is truly a fascinating read. I can't recommend this book enough to the lovers of the genre and can't wait to see what's in store for me in the future! J. R. R.

Driven by a problem keeping track or even remembering the numerous characters, I decided to read the book. It certainly helped in keeping the various Houses and characters in order.But surprisingly, the problems with the book, primarily the thin and clichéd characters (this is the smart son, the brave daughter, the evil knight, etc.) was much improved by the fine actors the HBO series had. Particularly Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, is probably the most interesting character on HBO since Ian McShane in Deadwood.If long novels of quasi-medieval kings is your thing, you probably already own the book. But if you are just struggling to understand the HBO series, and you have a lot of time on your hands, the book is worth it.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"36"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Binge Worthy Reading\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    As a self proclaimed bookworm, I crave that feeling that you get when you can't put the book down because it's so good.

The story focuses in turn on individual major characters, namely a brave castle lord, his brave wife, his 4 sons and 2 daughters, an evil queen and her evil brother, and a teenage girl across the sea who considers herself the rightful heir to the throne.  Some parts of the story are exciting and fun, so I've kept listening in spite of many unsettling plot devices.  So far, the brave lord has been decapitated in front of his daughter, a son has been thrown off a building and left paraplegic, the family's ancestral castle has been burned and their loyal servants killed, 3 children are missing and believed (by the brave mother) to be dead, and the oldest son has been treacherously murdered in a banquet hall despite his mother's pleas.  Then the brave mother herself, the only remaining sympathetic adult character who might possibly have pulled the story to some satisfactory ending, has had the skin peeled from her face and been partially eaten by crows before being killed. Meanwhile the evil queen and her ilk are doing very well.  Why would the author write this cruel farce?  It's fair to say that he wants to avoid the appearance of sentimentality and perhaps introduce a \"realistic\" element into his strange brand of fiction, but we feel him pulling strings and jerking us around, so how realistic is that?  Mr. Martin should think about why people want to read fiction.  It's because we want to hear a good story - well-told, deep and meaningful.  Villains shouldn't be allowed to triumph to the point of wiping out all adult members of a story's central sympathetic family.  No satisfying vengeance is possible at this point, so why go on reading (or, in my case, listening)?  I realize the author is hoping that we'll plod on, in hopes that some of the younger children will grow up, become sympathetic, and deliver some belated justice to the wicked.  Well, sorry, but forget it.

Families break, loyalties shift (wow, do they shift, and shift, and shift), paths diverge under duress into subplots with twists you'll never see coming, but really need to see resolved. However, gifted as he is, Martin cannot write as fast as you'll read, and the next installment in the series isn't due out for a while.

The author does a great job switching from character to character to develop the story.The ending for one of the characters is a little \"out there\" for my tastes; and a you are left hanging on the outcome of some characters which, I can only assume, is picked up in Book 2--which I will be downloading onto my Kindle shortly.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"37"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I'm in too deep, and I can't stop reading this series\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I don't think there's a lot I can say on a book that has so much hype.

After reading Game of Thrones, however, I do not think I will continue with the sequels.  It *was* a well-written book, albeit difficult at times to keep track of all of the new and similarly named characters thrown into the story in short intervals. But quite simply, I just didn't find the story interesting.  As the name suggests, Game of Thrones is all political and describes how several boring and relatively undifferentiated Houses are embroiled in political intrigue. I thought I would rely on the history of these Houses to add bulk to the story, but those potentially interesting tidbits just weren't there if sufficient quantity.  If I wasn't entertained by the main host of characters, I thought perhaps I could focus on the World instead.  But unfortunately that arena was disappointing as well.  The world is relatively small and there is very little (with one exception) differentiation between inhabitants of each region of the world. Descriptions about varying areas are shallow and makes it difficult for the reader to paint a real mental image about the characters' surroundings. I also enjoy a healthy dose of magic in my epic fantasy reads.  Though Game of Thrones constantly hints at it, nothing substantially materializes.On a positive note, I did really enjoy how the book was organized into different points of view.

The way he writes is by telling the story from many different points of view on characters that are vastly different.  The viewpoints you get from these characters differs so much, and you bond with them all, whether they be good or evil.Through this method of story telling, he tells what's going on all over the isle of Westeros, and across the Narrow Sea, all while shifting your perspectives on other characters by getting insides their minds.

I cringe when I read descriptions of this series as \"high fantasy\". High fantasy usually involves elves, dwarves, wizards, gnomes, magic, etc. It's the standard definition of 'high fantasy'. This book has one race. Humans. This book involves an *extremely* small amount of magic. Miniscule. This book has dragons in it that are eggs until the 2nd book and immature and unimportant even in the third book. Dragons may become more prominent in the 4th and 5th books (soon to come). So if you are expecting anything comparable to Tolkien-esque 'high fantasy' (true high fantasy), look for another series. As has been pointed out, this is *slightly* fictionalized medieval history. It's a tale of intrigue and kingdoms and warfare. Fantasy? Hardly. A good read but know what you are getting.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"39"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    An unpopular opinion\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Like so amny readers of the series, I came in after watching the show. After season 3, I couldn't wait any longer to find out what comes next. (Though before that I was content to learn from the show, preferred it, in fact.)I did not love this. Many times I thought, if I were not already invested in the characters, I wouldn't bother reading this. I know people who don't watch who tried to read this and gave up and I couldn't even berate them.It's long, it's drawn out and it can be complicated to figure out who's who. Please note that I am an avid reader, I enjoy complexity and don't mind a lot of brainwork. For some reason though, this book just didn't do it for me.I love the genre, I already loved the story. Please see other reviews and realize it's not this whole series I am ambivalemt about, just this book. I finished the first 4 so far and really enjoyed some. Martin's style in this book to me seemed dry. I do understand that having seen season 1 a few times, and already knowing what happened could have affected me, but I honestly don't think that was the problem.If you are deciding whether or not to read these, I still say, \"Go for it!\" Just understand that for some people it's tough to get into it for a while.

For those that love lore and backstory, there is plenty to dive into.

The level of nihilism in the book is crushing. Despite the book's plodding length several of the characters gain little depth throughout the story. Many of the more upstanding characters suffer from a chronic lack of common sense. This tends to give the impression that the evil characters are not devious, but simply unopposed.The world building is impressive, but in many way not too far removed from classic medieval-style fantasy. That's not a terrible thing in and of itself, but it does pull some away from the bits that make it unique. Ultimately though, the biggest strength of the book is its complex narrative, but sadly it's greatest weakness is a cast of characters who don't really don't hold up the weight of that narrative in the book. Very quickly it becomes very hard to care about what good or bad happens to the characters of A Game of Thrones.The world is so mired in a level of cynicism and nihilism that would make Franz Kafka wince.

If I had picked up on the books before I had picked up the TV series, I may have been disinclined to read them all.They are not horrible, and some of the characters are interesting, but GRRM spends way too much time describing the scenery, clothes, meals, etcetera (not to mention the blood letting and sex scenes), we get it...move on and tell your story.  I don't mind a brief description so as I can get a nice visual for the mind set and the feel of the scene, but I don't need a page of what was served at dinner or what materials, colors and designs went into someone's garments.My only other nitpick is all the minor characters..way, way too many.  It's hard to keep track of the many main players, let alone the castaways who have no real import to this story....and for the love of God if it's not confusing enough, why keep using the same names over and over again.

Of course I visualize the characters as they look on TV, which is slightly amusing. The imp is Peter Dinklage, despite being described completely differently in print. In truth, Martin improved as a writer tremendously from this first book in the cycle to now. Don't get me wrong,it's a good read, just not life-changing. I think it's 20 years or thereabouts from that book to this last one, and his \"voice\" really came into its own in that span. It's nice to lay a foundation in one's mind for the series and characters, but this is an average book at best. Still, if you're going to read the series,you pretty much HAVE to start here.

But the story flowed well, good action, superbly written. No one is safe in a Game of Thrones. You just never know how far someone will go, how low they may stoop, or how brave they can actually be. It's refreshing to be surprised by characters and their fates. Definitely not predictable I'll tell ya that! Awesome book.

It's a fun read. A page turner.It's not deep. It has good pacing. The characters do things that are interesting. They do stupid things that make them human. Martin knows how to weave a plot. Red herrings and plot reversals. Most are well crafted. A few are predictable. Overall I was please after reading it. The language was a bit overwrought, but that's fantasy. I like some of the characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister) and I hate others (Sansa, Joffrey, and that punk The Hound).But for real, come on guys, it ain't Proust.I was put off of it for the longest time because of the hype. I have friends who will not shut up about the depth and profundity of the imagery and the plot. I will never subscribe to HBO as I am a chord cutter, and I refuse to torrent, so the HBO series is off limits for now.  Yes I know I can buy the DVD and no I won't. I picked it up finally for a long flight.  I am glad I did, but for chissakesalmightee I am still put off of the hype. I plan to read the other books now.

I have started to read the sequel, and I think I am starting to notice a pattern.  Through the first 200 pages, you have trouble bringing yourself to read another page.  It is so painful watching some these characters get punished for living (living?).  The rest of the book leads into wondering if the character will somehow extract themselves from these predicaments, knowing most likely they won't, but curious enough to have a hard time putting the book down.I recommend this for those who enjoy a good tale and not necessarily fantasy fans.  This book really emits a great feel of political intrigue and battle.  However if you want a feel good story this is not it.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"42"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Pleasant Surprise\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    In middle age, I am probably not the intended  audience for this series.  However, I saw the  great  reviews, and decided to try it. What really helps in cases like this, is to  listen to the book on CD.  A skilled reader can make the book come alive.This is the case here.  I was swept into the narrative  by the reader and his many voices.  Concurrently,  I would read the book, to review a part I may have missed, or to get the spelling of a name. (An aside: when I first read  Elizabeth Peters' Egypt series,  my impression that they were arch, precious, or, as the British say, \"twee\". Listening to the CDs however, completely changed my mind.) This book has great narrative drive, action  and wonderful  characters.  (My favorites are Jon, Tyrion  and Hodar.)

What’s unique about this book is how many threats each character faces. The story features 8 distinct perspectives, but as a whole the story centers around three plots.Ned Stark, newly appointed Hand of the King, must journey to the capital to investigate the death of his predecessor, while the rest of his family attempt to navigate the politics of their new position. Jon Snow, Ned’s illegitimate son, leaves to join the honorable Night’s Watch, but finds the reality far less noble. And far away two exiled children dream of somehow reconquering their kingdom.In scene everything is filtered through the character, creating a strong sense of narrative in every chapter. The story can be a bit crude and violent at times, but that harshness is more accurate, if less palatable, than most fantasy novels. The book is long and made longer by extensive descriptions, but it is a great example of political intrigue. The trick is knowing who to trust, and how to convince them to trust you.+Complex characters+Strong Descriptions*Complex Plot*Large cast, 8 perspectives*Grim, sometimes crude3.5/5\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"42"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I Love GOT!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    As an avid viewer of the show, I was glad to see that it followed the book pretty well. Of course, with most books, it has much more details than the show could ever have. The storyline is complex and intriguing, with intertwining plots and different character point of views. You definitely have to pay attention to the little things or you might miss something later on. George R.R. Martin did an exceptional job of weaving things together, and I completely fell in love with some of the characters. Danaerys, for example, has a TON of character development. If you are interested in Medeival fiction (e.g. LOTR), then this book is definitely for you!

I purchased the kindle version.It is far superior to the paperback.The complete lack of proof reading in the Kindle version means that people shout \"Howl\" instead of \"How!\" Some sentences are turned into haiku by completely random punctuation. You can agree with Eddard when he laments into the darkness that he is a Tool. You can stare in confusion at the word £he. You can ponder what word or words 'sunrise is a contraction of. You can read the book in a William Shatner voice thanks to randomly italicized and embolded words.Basically, you are rewarded for slogging through this mediocre erotica by these scattered typos.

It is mainly about the main houses of the kingdom: the Starks, Lannisters, Targaryons and Baratheons.  It is exactly what the title says, a game of thrones.  It is each house fighting for the throne at one point or another for very different reasons.  It is very well written and amazingly detailed.  It is very interesting to see how every small thing each character does affects the other characters.  You will also root for some characters and hope and pray others are killed.  Just an FYI, don't get too attached to any character, he likes to kill off the much loved characters more frequently than the much hated characters.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"45"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Better in person.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I bought this for a friend of mine, who convinced me to watch the show.

What I really liked abou this book was the way the magic took a backseat. It was well put into the story, but didn't over power it.  Unfortunately for Mr. R.R. Martin, I have weaned (sp?) myself off of all multiple book sagas until the last one comes out, and then I read them all at once. (Thank you Mr. Robert Jordan and Mr. Terry Goddkind.) I find I have such a busy life, I forget what happened in the books prior.

Too many people and plots to follow! And I got through Cryptonomicon w/ endless plots. I find myself suddenly thrown into a family of people who it seems the authors just figured out he needs to complete a certain part of this saga. It's as though-Oh wait-I need to explain this somehow, so let's throw in more people. The names are superfluous and endless. There are actually only about 5 families this author need keep you current on. Still, after 3 books I am finding myself suddenly introduced to new characters that seem to be important to???? Nothing. Other than to continue sucking you further in and buying more books.I am finding myself caring less and less who the heck wins.I cannot keep track of all the names-long names with titles and fragmented attachments to the plots. What seems to be happening to me is I am getting tired of this authors lack of an outline. I am wondering if he wrote one and am answering myself NO. Not when some great knight that has never been mentioned before is suddenly thrown into the midst of a battle that rests with his victory simply so the story can go on & on & on. It seems an exercise in confusion and frustration. I would say I have been asked to remember over 30 names with tiles and all their kids only to have them not necessary to the main plot. If the author is trying to sell a lot of books he has succeeded. I believe it could have been written one volume. And unless you care what every one is wearing and what fabric/ metal it is and what the embroidery looks like, the clothing description is just a waste of good space.

Also, i find the division of \"chapters\" to be by characters silly, as the story is told in third person anyway, so he could've divided it into regular chapters.moreover - and most important - i find the killing of characters left and right, and cutting their plot lines as he does to be a gimmick. i think it only enables him to write as many books as possible, and only stopping when there's no more profit to be made. you don't really have a main character per-se, rather a lot of character the story revolves around which is fine; but as some of them die and others come along there's no end to it. frankly, if it weren't for HBO i wouldn't even buy it.so all in all, a nice book, nice author. no more, but no less.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"46"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you love the series, you're legit missing out on the literature part of this\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Watched the series first as im sure many have done so, and now I decided to get into the books like many have done so as well.

It was sad in the way so many people got killed off for no real reason other than to add drama.

To get the topic of the Kindle editing out of the way, the edition still has the punctuation and spelling problems mentioned by other readers which takes away from the reading pleasure - I'm quite surprised Amazon still hasn't picked this up.Now to the book itself. First, I admit my expectations were very high given the HUGE attention this series has drawn and the comparisons to LOTR. I must admit that I was left a tad disappointed with the story. It's true that GRRM has created an interesting world and some intriguing characters, but I must admit that some of the decisions made by the principal characters (read Ned & Kat Stark) need a very strong suspension of disbelief, even if you take into account their personality traits. I enjoyed the first half of the book a lot more than the second which I think had several predictable outcomes.

First, there are a ton of characters. Keeping track of who's who in the earlier parts of the story was very confusing. This wasn't helped by occasionally calling someone by their first name and other times by their last name. Second, I don't think the storyline concerning the Night Watch really fit in. I was so engrossed with the other stories that I grumbled every time I was pulled back up to the Wall.

I would  recommend the book to any adult or mature teen who can handle the  complexity.  I would also recommend reviewing all the characters listed by  house at the end of the book.  An exciting book with some great sword play  that is not overwhelmed by sorcery.  The book generally jumped from  character to character by chapter.

I have read just a few books which are able to capture my attention quite like A Game of Thrones. So this review is not centered on his ability to write, for I think he is a great writer. This review is particularly speaking about many of the scenes which I was rather disappointed with.I am a huge fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Macdonald, Rowling, and many other Fantasy writers. Each of these authors are fantastic at writing and made quite a bit of money from their individual works. Yet inside of these works, they never felt the need to include pornographic scenes in order to persuade people to read their books. However, when I read A Game of Thrones, I found these scenes very annoying. Martin implements these scenes slowly-perhaps not to shock some of the younger readers. However, If I wanted a book which had childish smut, I would have bought 50 Shades of Gray. But I bought this book because of the mature level of writing I expected in the pages.I know that this book made any clams of allowing children to read-I am still disappointed with Martin for this one reason.

I almost stopped reading it then.I'm well into it now, and I have come to the following conclusions:1. This is like Babylon 5.  Amazing story arc, amazing idea, writing and acting so over the top it sometimes distracts from that.  The depth and breadth of the story and its potential are a 12 out of 10, the writing is not even close to that.  \"Ser\" instead of \"sir\", \"maester\", et al.  Too many words written just to be pretentious, not because they add to the story, in my opinion.2. Too many 13 year old kids having sex.  He could have made everyone in the story 3 to 4 years older and not taken away one positive element, while not giving us the visuals.  I looked to see what HBO did with Daenerys, the woman that plays her is clearly a woman, not meant to be 13.All that said, an enjoyable read that unfortunately keeps hitting you in the face with how much better it could have been.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"47"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great start to a series done dirty by the TV show\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I know that the TV show was a big disappointment to most viewers (myself included), but this book is a fantastic read.

You can tell that he enjoys taking every preconcieved notion and expectation of where you think the story is going and giving you a sharp slap in the face to dispell your naivety.  He builds the story along lines that you think you've seen before,  building suspense and your hopes, then smashes them to bits.

It does no good to root for a character in this story, because they are just as subject to a brutal end as those you deem the villain. For that reason, I enjoyed the book immensely.

If you like the TV series, you owe it to yourself to read at least this first book. Mr. Martin has done a great job creating characters you will care about (and then he will kill them) and an incredibly rich setting. He's obviously done a lot of behind the scenes work creating a backstory for his world, and it makes the story that much richer. The characters all end up being three dimensional and believable. The hero's have flaws, and the villains are, in there own minds at least, doing what needs to be done. About halfway through you realize how rich this story is going to be.The problem is that, at least in this series (I haven't read any of his other works), he has Steven Kings disease. He won't use 10 words if he can find 20 that will do as well. He can make a scene with a character walking through a door last 5 pages.

You see the world through their eyes and you understand the choices they make (even though they may be foolish or wrong).

That's kinda the weird thing about this series; it's not so much fantasy as it is intrigue and drama, sprinkled with some fantasy elements.The characters are beautifully written, loaded with some of the wittiest and intelligent dialogue I have read.  The characters are all unique in their own way.  Some you hate, some you love, and some you hate then love.  But you can't just stop at the first book, because they all leave off on cliff hangers!Beware though, for those easily turned off by vulgarity, there are some parts that are graphic.

In the interview, Martin states that the Song of Fire and Ice books are \"fantasy for adults.\"  He is absolutely correct, that's exactly what these books are and they are exactly what I was looking for in a fantasy series.  I had not read much fantasy since J.R.R Tolkien and was looking for a series with something more than fluff or violence or magic.  These books fit the bill.  The Fire and Ice books are not the Fantasy of adolescent pimply faced teenage boys, nor is it the fantasy of breathless stay at home housewives, it is the fantasy of real life, good and evil, brains and stupidity and all the rest of the stuff we all struggle with.

Also, once you start, you can't stop, so block out a month or two to read the whole series up to the point where we are all collectively waiting for the next installment.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"51"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Book\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you want something to keep you buys for awhile and be very entertained then I highly suggest this book.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"52"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    If you like multiple POV\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Over all, Martin definitely has a distinct writing style. I'm usually not a fan on multiple point of view novels. However as a huge fan of the HBO series in which this is based off of, I couldn't pass this book up. I'm not a fan of the HBO covers though. So I bought it on my kindle where it doesn't have to ruin my bookshelf.If you like multiple POV, and can get past the almost \"textbook like\" writing style, I'd say you should give it a go\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"52"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The voice was a problem\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Maybe it is just because I started reading this book already having high expectations, but I was disappointed. I can't say anything about the plot line because I stopped reading half way through, but the voice of the story is what really bothered me in the fact that it didn't change. The story is told from a limited third person that switches points of view, covering everyone from the seven year old Bran to Daenerys, a cast away princess on a different continent and a range of characters in between. I feel that each character should have expressed there own narrative voice or tone--a certain style of specking or explaining things that was uniquely there own--but it was all told in the same, mostly bland, style.The narration style also leads to a sense of this happening, then that happens, then this happens but none of them are related, making events seem choppy and disjointed rather than flowing into a smooth tale. I don't know if this changes at all or has a point to it because (as I mentioned earlier) I did not finished the book, but it is one of the reasons why I dropped it.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"52"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great book, 10/10 recommendation.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The book is highly addictive covering many more characters than the TV series with  such a rich story.

The book is long (800 pages) but as Martin describes the devil lies in the details and he must explain everything clearly and precisely.

I love the story and the author has given his fantasy realm tremendous depth and realism - there's gritty political intrigue, rich backstory/history, and very compelling characters.  Its a very impressive and memorable story.  After three books though I can't shake the feeling that this story will never will work itself to a conclusion.  As soon as one of the multiple sub plots within the several story arcs seems resolved - two more intricacies are introduced.  Its similar to a soap opera: very engaging day-to-day but you know the broader underlying conflict will never work itself out and just when you think you should probably go do something better with your time, the author gives you a tidbit that sucks you in again.So an incredible book but I would not recommend picking it up unless you are prepared to invest considerable time in the series with the risk that it may never reach a satisfying conclusion.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"52"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It’s a classic for me now\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I throughly enjoyed every minute of this book.

Martin gives us chapters devoted to each character an their many  challenges throughout the book.

The story takes place in an imaginary world of dragons, direwolves, the undead dead, horse lords, and knights, royalty and castles. This book is both interesting and exciting and helps you escape into an unfamiliar world to get carried away and live vicariously through its characters. A long winter is coming . . .

I read the Kindle edition and found it to be a new and positive reading experience. I gave it four stars out of five because it was hard for me to keep all the many characters straight. I had to go back a lot so the x-ray feature on the Kindle was very helpful.

The book is also good reading becuase it develops the character very well leading the reader into the second book in the series A Clash of Kings. The plot moves along steadily with continuous movement among the characters and there is considerable historical detail contextually.  The landscape, both geographically, and psychologically is well developed and the anticipation and suspense builds in this book and surely towards the conclusion of the whole story.

The novel is split into many different chapters, repeating in sequences as it is told from the eyes of each main character. George Martin does not just create an existing world of ancient kingdoms, brave knights, passionate and proud families, he reveals it to you as if it had always existed. You fall in love with the loyal and strong Starks, the brave and true Baratheons and end up loathing the power hungry Lannisters. Secrets twist as lies are told, innocents are killed, children are slain, towers are immense and shadow over time as men play their game of thrones. Families are betrayed and stand up against evils, there are even tales of dragons and ghost riders in the deep woods.

I did like the idea of the plot and some of the twists, I just wish it was a little smoother read. I did like how the chapters were written in a different character view because it made things more interesting and characters relatable. I have not watched the tv series so my opinion is not biased as some other reviews seem to be.

It took some self-control to keep going and not put it away in exchange for something more...something less...What I will say about this book is that I am disappointed with the writing.  If this is the creation of \"gray\" characters, then I shudder to imagine other writings that are more black and white.  I find the author's use of cliche' incredibly irritating.  And yes, lack of description.  There must be something more to say about the wall other than that it is tall, wide, cold, etc.  The cells in the eyrie beg for more thorough  consideration.  Summer lasts how long?  Tell me more!  And every princess is lovely, eyes are blue (or violet), men are handsome, strong, old hags are, well, old hags,  wolves are fierce and fiery-eyed, oh PLEASE!

Game of Thrones is about the intense political maneuverings of royal families (which can easily be seen as political parties).With the good character development and varied perspectives, it is easy to get attached to particular players, although I found that a friend was rooting for different characters than I was. Tyrion is harder to figure out but provides great comic relief.Games of Thrones is not the typical, predictable novel that gets churned out too often these days. This book has lots of twists and turns and downright shocking events. I don't recall being so surprised by any other novel.

Somehow as gross and base as some of the events are, the characters and the riviting story get under your skin.  The blood and guts and the devaluing of human life might be a turn off for some, and the multitude of characters being introduced throughout the story confusing, the bottom line is that A Game of Thrones is surprisingly absorbing,  and after a chapter or two very hard to put down.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"54"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Not about war, but a story of men\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Although A Game of Thrones is a great fantasy title, as far as epic medieval warfare goes, it falls behind other better books.

This is not a \"Hobbit\" world, and were there no supernatural elements, it would be as fine a world.

I'm sure this is a good book but I wish text to speech was enabled.  I'll probably get through it eventually but doubt that I'll continue with the series.  I don't understand why, in 2013 with computerized e-book and handicapped accessibility built in, all e-book readers don't include text to speech.

The kind of book you find hard to put down. The editing of this e-book however is severely lacking professionalism, as has been said over and over in other reviews. How they made this many spelling mistakes in the day of Spell-Check is dumbfounding. Not something you want in any piece of literature, let alone one you pay for. Other than that I've found no problems with the function of the e-book. I am a first time buyer. I bought it on a Kindle Fire HD (2G) and it was just like reading a book. I was able to download the Kindle app on my iPhone, sign in and read it there when my daughter haughtily reclaimed the Kindle Fire.

I might give it 2.5 stars. The series suffers from repetition. The author literally reminds you of plot points that just occurred, all the time. The characters regularly repeat the same mantras over and over. So there is simply too much repetition. It's tedious.The series as a whole also suffers because, at it's heart, it's a fantasy soap opera. It's about plot. It's not about characters, it's not about conflict (strange as that may seem in books that have ample violence). It literally could go on forever. And sometimes it seems that way. The plot also suffers from too many characters with too much detail and story lines that really don't forward the narrative.For example, Pretty Pig, a pet of no importance whatsoever, gets more press time than Rikon, Bran, and Cately Stark, all central characters. It's as if the author refuses to pick up story lines of important characters or else the story would conclude. This trend will worsen as the books progress. The books will devote chapter after chapter of newly introduced characters, back story and machinations that end with their deaths leaving the reader to surmise what the hell the point of all that ink was.It will take 5 books for Arya to get to acolyte level of training in Bravos, Bran to get the greenseer training, Catelyn to reunite with Brienne. Etc. All the time you are thinking, when is the author going to wrap this up?At times I feel Martin thinks little of his audience's intelligence or simply cannot write smart, compelling fantasy.\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"55"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love it!!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Felt like kind of a phony not reading the books and watching the show so I ordered this and it's been great!!

The plot is good, the characters are all interesting, the flow is nice, and, most important of all, it's well written. I especially enjoy the way the story is told: through different perspectives from the main characters. Even though one often finds oneself wondering what other characters are doing at times - it adds depth and flavour. If there's something negative to say about this book - it's the always present descriptions of the character's garb. Sure, it helps the imagination, but at times it can become a bit tiring.

Good experience with the seller.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"59"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Not bad for a pot burner\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Usually I am not attracted to genre but Martin is not a bad writer.  He sneaks up on you.  Instead a big visual spash, he builds the landscape with periodic and intensly visual vignettes.  Just when you think you have the plot mapped he throws a giant monkey wrench which leaves you hanging and inevitably staying up way past your bed time looking for clues.  His story line is sprinkled with anti-heros; they all have feet of clay.  Even the the most attractive characters reveal base and venal tendencies which make you love them more.  A good read.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"59"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    HBO vs. Book?\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Perhaps my imagination doesn't have the same delivery as Peter Dinkelage, Sean Bean, and Mark Addy, but this is one time when I might be a bigger fan of the television show than of the book. However, that is more of a compliment to the show than a knock on the book. I loved the characters and plot, but Martin's prose is far from the best I've read. His language and dialogue ranges between archaic and modern quite sporadically. You'll be hooked and insist on finishing the entire series once you're done with this book, but Martin could have benefited from a team of HBO writers' collaborating on the novel itself.\\n  \\n","3":"4.0 out of 5 stars","4":"59"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A world which you need to live once in your lifetime\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am not sure if this book can be reviewed but I love the way George Martin has invented the story telling process through characters.

It's not that the book is too long.  It's not that the book has too many characters.  It's that much of the book is boring, several of the characters are cliches, and the political intrigue and battles are been there done that.The idea of the Wall and the Night's Watch is original and interesting - those characters are compelling, especially Jon Snow.  Tyrion Lannister is also a fully realized character, complex and real.  And the quasi-Mongol hoard Dothraki are interesting, but the whole Daenerys goes from frightened girl to suckling dragons is eye-rolling bad.And the author ought to either stick to familiar names and titles or make up new ones.  Calling the Khan the Khal and Sir rendered as Ser is stupid.I was looking forward to immersing myself in all five volumes, but I won't bother with the next four because, frankly, I don't care what happens to most of these characters or their world.  I don't have HBO but the previews LOOK good, so maybe when the DVDs come out on Netfkix and I have a blank weekend I'll watch.

But A Game of Thrones is a fantasy book that focuses on its characters rather than its setting. In fact, I often forgot I was reading a fantasy novel. But that didn't matter because Martin's characters filled the pages with so much energy that it didn't feel like anything was lacking.That's not to say that a fantasy world doesn't exist in the book. It broods in the background. There are references to important places and people and events, but these always seemed separate from the main plot.

I was originally brought to this book because of the popular show on HBO, after reading this book I may not go back to watching the show.

Anyone joins hands with anyone, new characters come in, play their important parts and suddenly die. At some point you start to wonder whom you're even supporting. The story becomes a soap opera where bubbles just form all the time.If I compare this to LOTR or Harry Potter, the thing which held those stories together was that there was a hero and a villain and everything happened as part of a grand plot at the end of which the hero defeats the villain. Not so in this. There's just too many characters and not enough centrality of plot.

Once I get through the series I'll have to find other works by this marvelous author. Crazy ending, but I loved all of it. Great read!

He doesn't shy away from anything he needs to do to make the plot interesting and realistic including killing off key characters when he feels it will add to the story.

However had I not seen the show and known what was going to happen I doubt I would have done anything more than read the first handful of chapters. There is not much in the way of consistent plot building in just this book to really peak any interest in me. As long as this book is I was expecting heavy, well done plot. It's there in the overall series from what I've gathered from the series but as a reader I expect the book to eclipse any visual interpretation of literature. This book fails to meet that expectation greatly. Since I already have the rest of the series (thanks to my husband having read it first) I may pick it back up at a later time. However I hardly doubt it. This is a rare case of feeling like the visual interpretation is better than the book; sad as that is.

I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and was hoping this book could fill the void while waiting for the last book to come.  Unfortunately, this book didn't even come close.  George R.R. Martin tries to write a fantasy genre novel, but instead created a filth ridden book that is page after page after page of incest, foul common day language (rather than making it a bit more true to fantasy by creating similar terms for use in THEIR world, not ours), and sexual encounters with children.  The book tries to base it's plot around the courts of the old kings and queens where children were betrothed at an early age.  However, I don't really care to read about the \"juicy\" details of how an[...]ld girl can't wait to have sex with her barbarian lover. (Which is explained in detail, much to my dismay).  It takes nearly 550 pages before any sort of action or even adventure (if you could call it that) occurs.  The beginning preface opens with magical white faced creatures slaying travelers in some haunted woods and then sends you on a 500 page jaunt across boring disconnected politics.  The characters themselves have no real connection to the reader.  At this point, I could care less if the characters live or die, or even what happens to the fictional world Martin is trying to create.  Do yourselves a favor, and pass on this book.

I found myself rolling my eyes at the tacky perverted descriptions of women and sex, which made it seem like more of an old man's gross fantasy than anything else. There is certainly a difference between a novel, with a decent plot, interesting and developing characters with a real sense of purpose, that happens to have sex and a trashy novel which seems to revolve around pointless insertions of text regarding someones figure that have really nothing to do with the action at hand.Ned Stark is two-dimensional and too \"good.\" The Lannisters, with one exception, are predictable. My feeling is that the author connects the most with (and perhaps the author is in fact) Tyrion, a dwarf who has a hard time getting the prettiest women and an even harder time proving his physical worth in the battlefield. He sort of turns himself into a mastermind and his insults are his armor against his complex regarding his size and his heartbreak regarding his father. Tyrion is perhaps the only readable and likable, although at times over the top, character in the whole novel.I read the first book and I watched the first two seasons of the show and I just can't say good things about it.

Have you ever read The Grapes of Wrath?  You get invested in the story and, all of a sudden, in the middle of the story, you're on the last page.  That's what this set of books is like.  You start to know the main characters and the author kills them.  Not just one or two.  He kills nearly ALL of them.  Bad guys, good guys, men women, children, animals... it doesn't matter.  It's not that I mind the actual killing, but not when it's virtually ALL the main characters.  Nobody you start to care about lives.  Only badly developed characters that deserve to die, live on.  Maybe it's too much like real life.  I started the first book and liked it so I ordered the rest of them.  Then I got to the end of Book 1 and was furious that I'd taken the time to read it!

But, as the book dragged on and I on I realized that I was being set up for a soap opera in which there was no intention of resolution, only more words and more invented accidents that kept the three story lines going. This is a soap opera, not a novel. It is just wandering through the characters until they are all dead. There is no hint at the resolution because it would not be a masterwork without at least three volumes of at least 700 pages. It seems that the author is getting paid by the word even though the words are readable, which is more than I can say for some recent authors. At least tolkien worked towards something other than wrack and ruin. Read this if you like reading. It has no great redeeming theme other than death comes in many packages. The northern watch episodes are just grim forboding of something that may or may not occur. The desert episode needs a tragedy to connect it back to the main episode. You can see this really early in the book. And the main episode depends on the bumbling of the good guys. Not a very inspiring message.

I'm not saying that I am definitely not reading the rest of the series, but it's unlikely.  However, I can understand how this book is very attractive to its fans.Try it - you might really enjoy it.

However, it was a HUGE disappointment.  While the story line is intriguing and the basis for the book is well thought out, the writing has to many issues.  First, the number of characters the book is written through is WAY to many.  I think there are 9 points of view (Eddard, Robb, Catelyn, Jon, Bran, Sansa, Arya, Deaneyes, Tyrion ect). It is hard to like/identify with one character and become involved in their story.  I know that all the stories are intertwined but come on, there are big gaps and the story line because the author jumps around from person to person.  I think he tried to give to many points of view and too many first person characters.  Then there is the ending.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  I understand that the book is a series, but try to end each book with some closure.  I felt like this guy just stopped writing because he was tired and wanted to start a new book.  I dont like it when an author makes you a slave to the series just because they leave it all hanging in the end.  He should make you want to read the series because you love/identify with the characters.  I wouldnt recommend this book or series to anyone.

If you've had the same experience, you may want to stay away.The author resorts to every possible cheat to move his plot along. Extremely competent characters make gross errors in judgement at convenient points. Characters act completely inconsistently with their established behavior. Impossible coincidences occur regularly to get characters into or out of a jam. Laws and traditions are introduced which make no sense whatsoever (allowing a duel to settle the outcome of a trial?), merely to get the author out of a plot hole.

We spend only a short amount of time with each one, so you never get a chance to know or understand them.Maybe the TV show is better, but I am unimpressed with the novel series.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"82"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Very good.\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    It's George rr Martin what do you expect.Dude must've been hungry writing this though.

From the first word on, the author weaves a web that will catch you if you're not careful. A wonderful read, and close, but not quite there, to the forests of Lothlorien. Here you keep a GodsWood.

Just as good the second time around.Martin is an author that isn't afraid to kill off a cherished hero or show you how good people can make bad choices. This is so much more realistic than your typical fantasy story where everyone lives happily ever after. Can be depressing at times to read but I for one really enjoy seeing the horror of combat and the twisting of values that can occur when characters undergo extreme events and stresses.Good stuff!\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"91"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Fast moving for fantasy\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I had been told that his books were dense and difficult to follow.

The only exceptionally boring narrator was Daenerys -- perhaps because she is far from the rest of the action, perhaps because I found her Stockholm Syndrome tedious.Nevertheless, this is the first 5 star book I have happened across in years.I enjoyed \"A Game of Thrones\" in much the same way as I enjoyed the first two installments in Sarah Monette's \"Melusine\" series: it is dark, complex, intriguing, and successful in its use of multiple narrators.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"91"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Too\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I am a huge fan of the show, so naturally I had to read the books.

The characters are rich, complex and compelling. GRRM is compared to the venerable Tolkien, but where Tolkien's characters are shining lights, GRRM's are sometimes heroic, other times cruel, at turns repulsive and later sympathetic, depending on the point of view from which the story is told. The result is a brilliant tapestry and a flowing, gripping tale.The book and those that follow are a revealing portrayal of feudalism. The term \"game of thrones\" is used by the characters in the novels to describe endless positioning for power among the 1% of an imagined medieval world.GRRM's understanding of human nature is enthralling.\\n  \\n","3":"5.0 out of 5 stars","4":"92"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great even after watching the show first\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I loved the various points of view.

After reading the intro chapter online, i was all excited about finding a new author. Martin's writing skills looked promising: the slaughter of the night watch by those weird undead things was very evocative, chilling. not many writers can bring you 'into the moment' like that.Where did that skill go? I have not been 'in the moment' since that intro. After diligently pushing through the first half of 'Game of Thrones,' I'm giving up. I have tried very hard to like this book, but despite the richness of the world he has created, i just can't seem to care about the characters or what they are doing. I don't think any of them are three-dimensional at all. you could sum each one up with a single phrase. In short, they are entirely predictable.Some of the reviewers have given Martin 'kudos' for creating characters that are more 'real' than your usual all-powerful hero, struggling with his prophecied destiny. OK, maybe he deserves credit for trying to make them more realistic, but he has not made them 'real.' They don't get under my skin at all. I can't imagine crying for the tradgedies they experience; I'm just not convinced.I kept thinking the story would get interesting, that the characters would grow, but from the reviews for the next book, looks like it's just 'same stuff, later on.'\\n  \\n","3":"2.0 out of 5 stars","4":"93"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love the book from the beginning to the end\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love the book from the beginning to the end.

This book was hard to put down and let me tell you I loved every min of it and will start reading the 2nd book right away.  There are kings, queens, war, magic, family, betrayal, romance, and tad of incest; I recommend this book to everyone.

Had the book been less well-written it would never have provoked the depth of dislike I feel for it.  However, far from being swept  into the story, I found myself continually putting it down or skipping  pages.The problem for me lies in the wealth of unlikeable characers. I  quite honestly couldn't find a single character I wanted to know more  about.  I started each chapter, grateful that I was going to read about  someone different, hopefully somebody I would care about.  Unfortunately I  never did end up caring.  It was not the moral \"greyness\" of the  characters which bothered me; many of my favourite fictional creations have  both good and evil  in their makeup.  It was more that I could find no  reason to like the characters nor any way to identify with them, and as a  result found myself alternately bored and depressed as I read.The world  Martin creates, however expertly, is a dark, gritty and cynical place.  Hope, innocence, kindness, and even sorrow do not survive in it.  And that,  for me, removes the very qualities that make a fantasy novel a joy to read  and set it apart from other  kinds of fictions.\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"93"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    This story is a downer!\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I liked the characters for the most part.

Song of Ice and Fire started out with strong world building and interesting and engaging characters. However, it slowly falls apart.It's important to know in this series there is a lot of violence, rape, and death, all graphically (almost pornographically) described. While labeled as \"fantasy\" it reads like horror, and the characters are slowly picked off one by one.While some of the characters are very interesting and engaging, women do not fair well. The women, (in the first four books), fall under standard archetypes. The mother. The whore. The evil queen. The witch. The princess. The tomboy. The shield maiden. While some of the men are archetypes, others seems fresh and original, which contrasts against the treatment of the females. It makes the females be seen not as characters, but as symbols - and the messages conveyed about those symbols are very uncomfortable to contemplate.With the announcement of the fifth book in the series, I had to spend some time with the books to prepare for the new volume. The problem is - I have absolutely no desire to re-read them. I have no interest in seeing this series through to the end.There is clearly a market for these stories, based on their sales and devoted fan base. I am not that market.

Too much sexual violence. The author seems to have a fascination of sex and rape of young girls.  Looking back, I’m not even sure who was the main character, and some of them just disappeared. There was no resolution at the end and if that was done to make me read his subsequent books, he failed.  I was getting bored towards the end and found myself skipping paragraphs just to finish this book. I know that many people just love to immerse themselves into Martin’s kind of world, but I like a book with a gentler, kinder, more civilized story.So, I’ll say it again, I read it and this definitely is not my genre.

And it sucked. Not just a little bit, but a lot.  I am a long time fan of Tolkien and the Fantasy genre, in particular.  I laughed out loud when I saw reviews comparing Martin to Tolkien.  There is absolutely no comparison and I'm sure J.R.R. would roll over in his grave by those comments.  It was not terribly well written but it did have possibility.  And then came the needlessly large amounts of graphic rape scenes.  I felt like (and after reading the passages to friends and discussing it with other readers who agreed) it was put in there for either shock value or some very sick personal reasons.  There's no need to have a graphic depiction of the deflowering of a 13 year old.  Just none.  And this isn't a \"feminist\" issue like another reviewer stated.  If your only excuse for the depiction of so many rapes is that anyone objecting is a \"feminist\" then that is just sad and pathetic.  And several children (at least, I stopped reading halfway through!) were brutally murdered or people tried to murder them.  This book was depressing to me.  It did not inspire me to pick it up and read more, it left me depressed and wanting to burn it.  And I've never felt that way about any other book I've ever read.

It just feels out of place in part because none of the characters early on appear to have any acquaintance or belief in it. Magic just seems to appear, as if from nowhere. And, when its used, it seems un-necessarily grotesque and, well, overly convenient.The whole series of seven books feels much longer than it needs, and some of the plot makes me wonder if the author made decisions while playing a long and bizarre D&D campaign.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"110"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Hooked\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Have read very few fantasy's.

What color his cloak is, what is embroidered on the cloak, what colors the embroidery is, the gold work on his breast plate, what patterns are on the breast plate, a list of every kind of jewel on his breastplate. He describes ( in painful detail ) the guys shoes and his gloves and his helm and his mail and on and on and on, and none of it has anything to do with the story. The whole book is that way.

The books themselves are just wonderful.  I am an avid audio book listener as they have pleasantly filled my long rides to work and home for over 10 years.  Therefore, I have listened to a couple hundred of them.  I was so excited about this book coming out in the audio format, couldn't wait to get it.  Well, I give it only one star because it wouldn't let me rate it with minus stars.  This may be one of the worst audio presentations I have ever listened to.  I think they completely erred in their selection of the audio performer.  So many of the characters in the book are young, or close to it, and the performer is an elderly man that makes every character sound like he is at least 110 years old.  Add to that the unforgivably annoying habit of whistling on every \"S\" and it is just too painful to even listen to this.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING????????  I made it to the 4th CD and just couldn't take it any more.  It is a shame that they had to totally destroy what should have ended up being one of the all time great audio books.  I am so upset at having spent money on this.  I will stick to the books.\\n  \\n","3":"1.0 out of 5 stars","4":"123"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Already read it in print format\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    The characters and the plot are so well written that you feel that you are there.

R. Martin is well written with nicely drawn characters.  That being said, in my opinion, this work comes no where near other fantasy series (LOTR, Potter, Narnia, Golden Compass, etc.).When a paperback book is over 800+ pages you recognize the commitment as a reader that you are undertaking.  While this was not wasted time, it was definitely too large a commitment to a novel that plays out like a medieval soap opera rather than an exciting fantasy novel.  The battle between warring factions and throne seats has it all - drama, incest, war, brutality and poltical posturing.  It didn't feel like 800 pages (most of the time) as the pages moved quickly by.However, I am going to wait for the success/failure of the upcoming HBO miniseries before I decide to venture further into this 4-part saga.\\n  \\n","3":"3.0 out of 5 stars","4":"124"},{"1":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    I stand corrected\\n  \\n","2":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    For a long time I refused to listen to my sons who insisted I should read their favorite book.

It's a sad comment on my dogged persistence in the face of overwhelming evidence.  I enjoyed J. R. Tolkien's Hobbit/Lord of the Rings  and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series and their ilk immensely and was sad to see each end.  Mr. Martin's greatest talent lies in convincing the reading public to purchase his stories.  Martin takes an interesting theme and that should have been well handled in 400-500 pages and balloons it through five books.  He constantly introduces new characters and locations throughout the meager plot thread that are never seen or heard from again thus expanding his page count to no purpose.

I have read books 1-4 over and over again. When I saw HBO was shooting Game of Thrones, I wanted to read it once more before that series begins next year, so I grabbed the Kindle version.The amount of typos in this version is completely unacceptable. It was obviously transcribed and never even perused before being uploaded. It makes Bantam look bad, makes Martin look bad, and makes me so mad that I am having a hard time enjoying the book.The types of mistakes range from the most basic: a completely wrong word such as \"he\" instead of \"had\" or a basic typo such as \"sex\" instead of \"ser\" to the unexplainable: italicizing a word and splitting it into hyphenated syllables for no apparent reason. It is averaging an error each page near the end, as if the transcriber had checked out completely by this point.Do yourself a favor, especially if this is your first time reading this amazing book.

The ending could be debated forever, but what stands out to me is this...Bran Stark was responsible for SO many needless deaths in the show. From the time he disobeyed his mother and climbed that tower, starting the war pretty much, to going against three eye raven because of his curiosity, many died because of his stupidity. Yet...THEY MADE HIM KING IN THE END!!!! Banishing the one truly loyal, deserving, and worthy person to the wall. Im glad John went North though, but smug Sansa and King Bran coming out on top were poor endings for a otherwise excellent series!!

Whoever was reviewing the OCR job for mistakes wasn't very good in the first place, and it seems about halfway through he or she just gave up.Having to stop and unwind the mystery of the misplaced character is just terrible for immersion.
