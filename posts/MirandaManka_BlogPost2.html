<p>Between the first blog post and this second blog post, I decided to change my topic. I am now looking at article posts on a site called arlnow (local news/articles for Arlington, VA). I want to look at posts about covid and compare both the language used (for example the change in word usage over time from coronavirus to covid) and the content of the posts that mention covid (for example are schools mentioned more, or restaurants, etc). I also want to look at the sentiment of the posts and what is changing over time. This may still change as the methods I learn in the class progress if I want to change direction or to something more specific.</p>
<p>For this I webscraped the arlnow site. I got articles that date from now back to mid-March 2020 by searching on the site for “covid”. I may do this for more terms in the future depending on my analysis needs/research question progression. This gave me 550 articles and I have the title, author, time/date, and text from the posts. Figuring out this code chunk took way longer than I expected but I haven’t done much with web scraping before so figuring out how to get exactly what I wanted from the site using the css selectors was difficult and time consuming but I got it.</p>

<p>Overall, I have my data (but can easily get more if needed) and some research ideas that I am really looking forward to exploring more as we learn more methods in class! The webscraping was difficult and time consuming and I was running into some errors with the word cloud, and I think I may need some time with figuring out corpus/token/etc, but I was happy to get my data and start to look at it and analyze a little bit of it.</p>

<span id="cb21-36"><a href="#cb21-36" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Between the first blog post and this second blog post, I decided to change my topic. I am now looking at article posts on a site called arlnow (local news/articles for Arlington, VA). I want to look at posts about covid and compare both the language used (for example the change in word usage over time from coronavirus to covid) and the content of the posts that mention covid (for example are schools mentioned more, or restaurants, etc). I also want to look at the sentiment of the posts and what is changing over time. This may still change as the methods I learn in the class progress if I want to change direction or to something more specific.</span>
<span id="cb21-37"><a href="#cb21-37" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb21-38"><a href="#cb21-38" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For this I webscraped the arlnow site. I got articles that date from now back to mid-March 2020 by searching on the site for "covid". I may do this for more terms in the future depending on my analysis needs/research question progression. This gave me 550 articles and I have the title, author, time/date, and text from the posts. Figuring out this code chunk took way longer than I expected but I haven't done much with web scraping before so figuring out how to get exactly what I wanted from the site using the css selectors was difficult and time consuming but I got it.</span>
